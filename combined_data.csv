0,Business,"As the world’s largest — and one of its most unequal — democracies votes in a mammoth national election, a new debate has gripped the campaigns of both Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress party. At the heart of this latest political slugfest is the idea of a potential redistribution of wealth. But while the Congress party has alluded to the need for some resources to be reallocated to traditional marginalised economic and caste-based communities, Modi and the BJP have accused the opposition of plotting to hand over wealth from Hindu households to Muslims. So what’s the controversy about and what do economists say about the proposals for a relook at India’s wealth distribution? In April, Rahul Gandhi, a scion of the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty, said if voted to office, his Congress party would conduct a caste census along with an economic and institutional survey to determine who owns what and earns how much. Following this, a portion of the 16 trillion rupees ($192bn) of benefits given to 22 big Businessmen by the Modi government would be transferred to 90 percent of the country’s people, as a starting point for delivering social justice, he said. Gandhi described the caste census as an “X-ray” into Indian society. “This is not a political issue for me, this is my life mission,” Gandhi said. “You can write down; no force can stop the caste census.’’ The Congress party manifesto doesn’t talk directly about redistribution of wealth.  It says, “We will address the growing inequality of wealth and income through suitable changes in policies.’’  On the caste-based census, it says, “Congress will conduct a nation-wide Socio-Economic and Caste Census to enumerate the castes and sub-castes and their socio-economic conditions. Based on the data, we will strengthen the agenda for affirmative action.” Yet, responding to Gandhi’s speech, Modi has been repeating in election rallies that the Congress party has hatched a “deep conspiracy’’ to snatch the wealth of people and gold of Hindu women to distribute it among Muslims, whom he described as “infiltrators” and “those who have more children”. The opposition has accused Modi of resorting to “lies” and “hate speech” to distract people from high unemployment and rising prices, and has complained to the election commission. India is the fastest-growing major economy in the world, but also suffers from deepening inequality. Numerous studies have shown that the benefits of India’s brisk growth have been unevenly distributed. A new study by researchers at the World Inequality Lab shows that income and wealth inequality in India today is, in many ways, worse than it was even under British colonial rule. India’s richest 1 percent control 22.6 percent of national income and more than 40 percent of the country’s wealth. Meanwhile, the bottom 50 percent control less than 10 percent of national wealth. Inequality was worsened over the past decade of Modi’s rule. India has   third behind only China and the US — and world’s highest number of poor at 228.9 million, according to  . The Congress party has accused the Modi government of ‘crony capitalism’ and favouring certain Businesses in government contracts. The government has denied the accusations saying it has not favoured companies and has instead invested in welfare programmes to improve the lives of the poor. Experts say India’s inequality is the result of the prevailing economic and political system. Even as both governments of the BJP and the Congress have launched reforms and pushed for economic growth over the past three decades, they have failed to generate enough employment, check inflation, and move the workforce from low-income farming to well-paying non-farm jobs, resulting in high inequality of wealth and income. There is no one view among economists. Those against the idea say redistribution will be counterproductive by taking capital from wealth generators thereby handicapping and disincentivising them to contribute to the economy. But others argue that redistribution is required not only in wealth but also in opportunities like education, healthcare, access to financial resources, water and energy, which will boost poor people’s capacity to generate income and reduce inequality in the long run. Redistribution of income and wealth is a very good idea in contemporary India, said Deepankar Basu, economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “The high and rising level of economic inequality suggests that the economic system does not work equally for all. The wealth and income being generated by the system is predominantly being cornered by the rich,” said Basu. “Not only does this have economic implications, but it also distorts the democratic process — extreme wealth inequality allows the super-wealthy to disproportionately influence the political process through various channels like campaign contributions and donations to political parties. This erodes the democratic system of governance.’’ Devashish Mitra, professor of economics, Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, Syracuse University, New York, agreed that some wealth distribution “might not be a bad idea”. “But it is a politically contentious issue, and there might be political problems in enacting any kind of means to redistribute wealth,’’ Mitra acknowledged. One solution, Mitra said, might be to combine wealth redistribution with “some reduction in income taxes”. That would partially compensate for the wealth redistribution. “Then, we will have a combination of wealth taxes and income taxes that could lead to both greater equity and greater efficiency than in the current situation,’’ he said. The Congress is arguing that data from a caste-based census will help with the implementation of welfare and social security schemes. The party has promised to raise a Supreme Court-mandated cap on reservations in higher education and government jobs for underprivileged groups called Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs). If successful, this political pitch could in theory help the Congress break the BJP’s growing stranglehold over the Hindu vote across castes and sub-communities. Modi, in turn, has responded by alleging that the Congress wants to give Muslims benefits that are meant to be allocated on caste — not religious — lines. He has cited a 2006 speech by then Congress Prime Minister Manmohan Singh where he said disadvantaged communities and religious minorities, including Muslims, should have the first claim on national resources. The Congress has insisted that it has no wealth redistribution plan, and that Singh’s 2006 comments had been misinterpreted. In an April 24 television interview, Sam Pitroda, an adviser to the Nehru-Gandhi family and head of the overseas wing of the Congress party, added another twist to the debate by arguing that India should debate whether an inheritance tax might help reduce wealth inequality. Modi has responded by accusing the Congress of plotting a wealth and inheritance tax that would snatch away people’s wealth accumulated through hard work. The Congress, he said, aims to loot people “zindagi ke saath bhi aur zindagi ke baad bhi” (in life, and after death), echoing the popular tagline of the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation. अब कांग्रेस का कहना है कि वो Inheritance Tax लगाएगी, माता-पिता से मिलने वाली विरासत पर भी टैक्स लगाएगी। आप जो अपनी मेहनत से संपत्ति जुटाते हैं, वो आपके बच्चों को नहीं मिलेगी। कांग्रेस का पंजा वो भी आपसे लूट लेगा।   कांग्रेस का मंत्र है- कांग्रेस की लूट… जिंदगी के साथ भी,…  — BJP (@BJP4India)  The Congress party distanced itself from Pitroda comments by saying his view does not reflect the position of the party. Jairam Ramesh, a spokesman of the Congress party, referred to past comments by BJP ministers in favour of an inheritance tax. Modi has clarified that the BJP has no intention to bring such a tax. An inheritance tax, also known as estate tax or death duty in some countries, is a levy imposed on the total value of money and property of a deceased person before it is passed on to their heirs. Generally, this tax is determined by assessing the value of the assets remaining after certain exemptions or deductions. Essentially, the government collects a share of the wealth transferred from the deceased to their beneficiaries. Globally, inheritance taxes are widespread in nations including the UK, Japan, France, and Finland. The United States does not impose an inheritance tax at the federal level, though it has an estate tax. However, six states independently retain inheritance tax regimes. There is no estate duty or inheritance tax payable in India. Estate duty on property that is passed on to the legal heirs on the death of a person was removed in 1985 by the then Congress government of Rajiv Gandhi — Rahul’s father — citing the need to simplify the tax system and promote investment and saving. However, other taxes such as capital gains tax, wealth tax, and gift tax are applied to inheritances depending on the circumstances. Before the removal, estate duty was payable on a slab basis ranging approximately from 7.5 percent to 40 percent of the principal value of the estate. This estate tax was introduced in 1953 in a bid to reduce economic inequality. In recent years, worldwide, there has been a trend towards scrapping estate or inheritance tax. Five European countries have   their estate or inheritance taxes since 2000. On the other hand, US President Joe Biden has been supporting higher   on inherited wealth. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said inheritance tax could nullify India’s decade of progress. Raghuram Rajan, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India has said that while inclusive growth will aid in the expansion of the economy, taxing the rich more is not the way to do that. Other economists back an inheritance tax. “An inheritance tax will make the whole economic system fairer by redistributing some of the accumulated wealth away from the children of wealthy people,’’ said Basu. “These tax revenues can then be used to finance public education, provide public healthcare and affordable housing, and support mitigation efforts related to the negative effects of climate change, which disproportionately impacts the poor.’’ Syracuse University’s Mitra said that while an inheritance tax might make some economic sense, he sees “enormous scope for corruption, stemming from the subjectivity in the valuation of inheritances and the unlimited scope in misreporting the actual value of inheritances”. Progressive taxation and greater social spending could be other solutions to  . A greater emphasis on   such as capital income taxation, net wealth taxation, and transfer taxation would generate tax revenue that could allow greater investment in health, education and infrastructure. “There are many policies that can be adopted to address rising economic inequality in India,’’ said Basu. “These include increasing the tax rate for the top 1 percent of income earners, increasing the corporate tax rate on relatively large firms, improving educational opportunities and making them accessible for the poor.’’",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/8/a-new-election-debate-should-india-take-from-the-rich-give-to-the-poor,Al Jazeera,"Should India take from the rich, give the poor?

1,Business,"Air safety officials in the United States are investigating whether employees at Boeing falsified inspections records for the 787 Dreamliner. The Federal Aviation Administration said on Monday that it had opened the probe after Boeing voluntarily informed officials that it may not have completed required inspections to “confirm adequate bonding and grounding where the wings join the fuselage on certain 787 Dreamliner airplanes”. “The FAA is investigating whether Boeing completed the inspections and whether company employees may have falsified aircraft records. At the same time, Boeing is reinspecting all 787 airplanes still within the production system and must also create a plan to address the in-service fleet,” an FAA spokesperson said in a statement. “As the investigation continues, the FAA will take any necessary action – as always – to ensure the safety of the flying public.” Boeing raised its concerns after an employee observed an “irregularity” and raised the issue with a supervisor, Scott Stocker, head of the Boeing 787 programme, said in an email to staff. “We quickly reviewed the matter and learned that several people had been violating company policies by not performing a required test, but recording the work as having been completed,” Stocker said. Stocker said that Boeing “promptly informed our regulator about what we learned and are taking swift and serious corrective action with multiple teammates.” “Fortunately, our engineering team has assessed that this misconduct did not create an immediate safety of flight issue,” Stocker said. “But it will impact our customers and factory teammates, because the test now needs to be conducted out of sequence on airplanes in the build process. I know this frustrates all of you as much as it frustrates me, and it’s a reminder of why it’s so critical that each of us does our part, every day, to ensure full compliance with our policies and procedures. And to speak up if you see something that doesn’t seem right.” The probe comes after a Boeing whistleblower made separate allegations of serious flaws in the production of the 787 at a Senate committee hearing last month. Boeing’s safety record has been under intense scrutiny since   of a Boeing 737 Max during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. Following the near-disaster, the FAA barred Boeing from expanding production of the 737 MAX and ordered it to present a plan to address “systemic quality-control issues” within 90 days. The mid-air blowout was the latest incident to tarnish Boeing’s image after two 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/7/us-officials-probe-claims-boeing-workers-falsified-inspection-records,Al Jazeera,US officials probe allegations Boeing workers falsified inspection records,0
2,Business,"– When Aamir Dhedhi took his mother to India in 2014 to get treatment for Parkinson’s disease, the doctors there advised him to procure cannabidiol (CBD) oil to help her manage her pain. It was the first time that Dhedhi, a Karachi-based entrepreneur, learned about the medicinal use of the cannabis derivative. On returning to Pakistan, the Businessman ordered a small quantity of the oil from the United States. Almost instantly, it helped calm his mother’s nerves and reduce tremors, he said. Dhedhi became a firm believer in CBD’s benefits. “Seeing the oil’s impact on my mother’s wellbeing, this has grown into a passion project for me,” the 49-year-old Businessman told Al Jazeera. While his mother eventually passed away in 2020, Dhedhi said he has since seen others get relief from CBD oil. “Now, I want to help our local growers expand their production and help spread its usage,” he said. Dhedhi is not alone in wanting to develop a homegrown industry for medicinal cannabis. In February, Pakistan approved the passage of an ordinance that created the Cannabis Control and Regulatory Authority (CCRA), a body tasked with “regulating the cultivation, extraction, refining, manufacturing, and sale of cannabis derivatives for medical and industrial purposes”. The regulatory body will be overseen by a 13-member board, which will include representatives from different government departments, intelligence agencies as well as the private sector. The establishment of the regulatory body, which was first proposed in 2020 under the tenure of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, points to Pakistan’s efforts to tap into a fast-growing and lucrative global cannabis-derivatives-related industry. According to Ireland-based Research and Markets, a research organisation, the global cannabidiol market, which stood at nearly $7bn in 2022, is expected to cross $30bn by 2027. Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive compound in the cannabis plant that gives users a high, CBD is not psychoactive and believed to have therapeutic effects. It is increasingly prescribed by doctors to help with anxiety, chronic and acute pain, and other medical conditions. Syed Hussain Abidi – the chairman of the Pakistan Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (PCSIR), a government-owned research organisation, and member of the board of governors of the CCRA – said the creation of the regulator was a requirement of United Nations laws. “The UN laws say that if a country wants to produce, process and conduct sales of cannabis-related products, it must have a federal entity that will deal with supply chain and ensure international compliance,” he told Al Jazeera. The regulatory framework for the CCRA specifies the maximum level of THC in the cannabis derivative to be 0.3 percent to avoid the abuse of medicinal products and use them recreationally. The ordinance has laid out strict penalties for any violation of laws, with fines ranging from 10 million Pakistani rupees ($35,000) to 200 million Pakistani rupees ($716,000), with monitoring and inspection conducted in tandem with Pakistan’s Anti-Narcotics force. Abidi said the country could use cultivation of the herb to its advantage and generate revenue through export, foreign investment and domestic sales to shore up its precarious foreign reserves. Until now, Pakistani law has barred the cultivation of cannabis, but the country’s northwestern region, particularly the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, is home to thousands of hectares of land where the crop has been cultivated for hundreds of years. For the most part, governments have chosen to look away rather than crack down. But the February ordinance aims to change that. On the one hand, it talks about “regulating” the area where cannabis is cultivated in the country, and issuing licences to farmers for growing the plant. On the other hand, the new regulatory regime could give the government a clearer mandate to penalise those who produce cannabis without a licence. The National Cannabis Policy, which the PCSIR prepared last year and which served as the basis of the ordinance, mentions that the broader goal of the regulations is to curb the “illegal and prevailing cultivation of cannabis”. “Technically, now the cultivation is legal since the ordinance has been passed, but we are still in [the] process of developing rules and procedures and awaiting registration of the authority,” Abidi said. Licences, it is expected, will be issued for five-year periods. The federal government will designate areas where cannabis can be grown legally. Abidi said said that according to estimates, there are nearly 28,000 hectares (70,000 acres) of land – mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and some in the southwestern province of Balochistan – where cannabis is grown. “We have a long-established tradition of cannabis cultivation,” he said. “We need to avail this opportunity.” Dhedhi, the Karachi-based entrepreneur, agrees. He is partnering with farmers in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to help modernise their cultivation methods and improve the efficiency as well as the quality of the product. Cannabis in Pakistan is traditionally grown outdoors, relying on sunlight, and with minimal use of pesticides, fertilisers or any other chemical substances. This organic nature of Pakistani cannabis makes it different from that which is mass-produced in many other nations, but it also means that both the quality and quantity of the production are less reliable. “We have massive potential in this field to provide health benefits through CBD. There is an opportunity to provide cheaper medical alternatives to people, which can help our domestic users as well as [improve the] potential for export,” Dhedhi said. “That can bring in financial rewards to our local growers.” More than 1,500km (930 miles) north of Karachi is the Tirah Valley, a vast mountainous tract of land situated between the tribal districts of Khyber and Orakzai in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. There, Suleman Shah, a 32-year-old mechanical engineer-turned-farmer, shares Dhedhi’s dream. Shah has been running the family’s cannabis farms for the past eight years, and his staff of nearly 40 people plant cannabis on nearly 200 acres (81 hectares) of land. Most farmers in the region, he said, were unaware of the medicinal qualities of hemp and primarily grow the plant for its recreational characteristics, using traditional methods. Though cultivating cannabis has been illegal, Shah said he never faced any reprimand from the government. Still, farmers like him have faced other challenges. Cannabis cultivated in neighbouring Afghanistan – with even less government oversight – had previously meant that Pakistani cannabis faced tough competition in the local recreational use market. The neighbours have long had a fairly porous border. “When there used to be cannabis cultivation in Afghanistan, we would often be in loss, unable to recoup our investment in growing the plant. But since [the] Taliban have placed a ban, our Business is doing considerably better,” the farmer said, referring to the Afghan Taliban, who returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Before the Taliban took over in Afghanistan, Shah said he was earning about 50,000 Pakistani rupees ($180) per acre, just barely sufficient to meet the cost of production. “However, the last two years have been better. Take this year for example, when I was able to make nearly 500,000 rupees ($1,800) per acre,” he said. “If the government brings on the regulatory framework, it will only help the farmers more,” Shah told Al Jazeera. “They can provide expertise to the farmers, help them research and grow better quality of products for the people, allowing to move beyond just the recreational use.” Globally, one litre (0.26 gallons) of CBD oil is priced at between $6,000 and $10,000, depending on quality. “This is the potential we need to tap into by modernising our cultivation and processing methods,” Shah said. Not everyone, however, is convinced that Pakistan’s shift towards embracing cannabis production will give its economy the kick it needs. Fawad Chaudhry, a former federal minister who is credited with kickstarting the conversation around facilitating CBD and industrial hemp production in late 2020, said that the four-year delay since then in getting the plan off the ground means Pakistan has been “late to the party”. “My suggestion [in 2020] was simply that you allocate space for growth of the plant, issue international tenders for investors and let them come here. But we wasted our potential and threw away the time advantage,” he told Al Jazeera. “The world has moved forward.” Robin Roy Krigslund-Hansen, the chief executive and co-founder of Formula Swiss, a Switzerland-based cannabis producer and global distributor, agreed. Krigslund-Hansen said that while he favoured countries taking steps in the “right direction” by showing interest in the medicinal usage of cannabis, there was a risk of over-saturation in the market. “Germany has recently legalised it. China is a major producer. Latin American countries are doing it as well. So, you have a lot of production from different countries, but when everybody is a producer and seller, then who will be the buyer?” the Businessman asked. He questioned whether Pakistan had the capacity to produce medicinal-grade cannabis that could meet global standards. “If you want to sell medical grade cannabis, it must be produced indoors, ensuring consistency and uniform production. When you grow it indoors, the electricity costs will be exceptionally high to keep the lights and air conditioning, all to make sure that the product remains top-grade throughout,” he said. “And this will cost a significant amount of money.” Abidi, the government official, however, remained optimistic when asked about these challenges. He acknowledged that Pakistan needed more resources to “hygienically produce cannabis” but said that his organisation had been tasked by the government to develop processes to improve the quality of the product. “We have developed end-to-end solutions to extract top-quality CBD oil and currently, we are carrying out our research and extraction in Lahore, Karachi and Peshawar in our pilot project,” he said. “We are anticipating that in three years, we can easily generate revenues of over $1.5bn, domestic sales and exports combined.” Shah, the farmer, said he is also developing indigenous ways to improve production methods with the help of entrepreneurs like Dhedhi and insisted that the organic, outdoor nature of Pakistani cannabis growth was its defining feature. “We will be using plastic sheets to cover our plantation instead of building greenhouses. We are developing methods to stop cross-pollination,” he said. Abidi, the board member, acknowledged the stigma associated with the use of cannabis products in a conservative society like Pakistan but said that the government was counting on growing awareness of the benefits of CBD among young people. “The regulatory framework will ensure that people will get only the prescribed, medicinal use products, [and] it will crack down on the illegal sales and consumption of marijuana,” he said. “Once the clean product goes for retail, it will help curtail [the] black market, and only patients with prescriptions can access it.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/8/pakistan-bets-on-a-cannabis-high-as-its-economy-struggles,Al Jazeera,Pakistan bets on a cannabis high as its economy struggles,0

4,Business,"Elon Musk suggested testing Tesla’s full self-driving feature in China by deploying it in robotaxis, Chinese state media has reported. During  , officials told the Tesla CEO that Beijing “welcomes Tesla to do some robotaxi tests in the country” and hopes it can “set a good example”, the state-backed China Daily reported on Wednesday, citing sources familiar with the matter. Chinese authorities, however, did not immediately approve Tesla’s widespread use of the Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature, the newspaper said. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The China Daily report follows an unannounced visit by Musk to Beijing late last month, during which he held talks with Chinese Premier Li Qiang. During his visit, Musk received an endorsement of Tesla’s data-security procedures from a top Chinese auto association and sealed an agreement with Chinese tech giant Baidu to use its mapping licence for data collection on China’s public roads. Tesla still needs to get approval from Chinese regulators to collect and transfer data used to train its software before it can fully roll out FSD, which the China Daily said was not discussed on Musk’s visit. Tesla operates its biggest manufacturing plant outside the United States in Shanghai, where about half of its vehicles are produced. Musk has shifted Tesla’s focus away from making affordable electric cars towards burgeoning technology, such as autonomous driving software, robotaxis and humanoid robots. The electric car maker is struggling with falling car sales amid fierce competition from Chinese brands such as BYD. Tesla’s vehicle deliveries fell by 8.5 percent in the first quarter, contributing to a 40 percent slide in its stock price since July. The company last month reported profits of $1.1bn in the first quarter, down from $2.51bn a year ago.

5,Business,"Air India was once so renowned for its service that Singapore’s founding statesman Lee Kuan Yew used the airline as a blueprint for launching the city-state’s own flag carrier in the early 1970s. In recent decades, India’s national airline came to be seen as a cautionary tale of decline as it racked up billions of dollars in losses and battled a reputation for tardiness and poor service. When the Tata Group bought the company in October 2021, returning control to the wealthy Tata family after decades of state ownership, CEO Natarajan Chandrasekaran laid out a clear objective: “To build a world-class airline”. Tasked with leading this mission is Air India CEO Campbell Wilson, who was recruited from Singapore’s low-cost airline Scoot in 2022 to turn around the carrier, founded in 1932 by French-Indian aviator entrepreneur JRD Tata. “Standards have slipped considerably over the years,” Wilson told Al Jazeera in an exclusive interview. But Wilson is adamant that “the journey to restoring Air India to its former glory is well under way” under a five-year turnaround plan unveiled last year. The Tata Group has spent tens of billions in transforming the company in recent years, investing in 470 new aircraft, cabin modernisation, a brand refresh and customer service changes. After the “capital-intensive” five-year plan is completed, Air India hopes to capitalise on the huge growth potential of the Indian aviation market, the world’s third-largest with some 145 million domestic passengers annually. The Tata Group’s initial priority has been its ageing fleet, the upkeep of which has been neglected for decades. Shortly after the ownership change, Air India added 36 leased aircraft – 11 Boeing 777s and 25 Airbus A320s – which allowed the airline to launch six new international routes and increase frequency across a further 24. Air India’s largest investment came with its   to buy 470 new Airbus and Boeing aircraft at a cost of $70bn, including 140 A320neos, 70 A321neos, and 190 of the 737 MAX. Wilson said the acquisitions will enable Air India to “operate the most advanced and fuel-efficient fleet within five years”. The airline also plans to spend $400m to retrofit its existing fleet by refurbishing cabin interiors. Wilson said the retrofit will initially focus on the airline’s narrow-body A320neo and A321neo aircraft, after which 40 legacy wide-body Boeing 777s and 787s will receive a “complete makeover with all new interiors”. Other changes to improve onboard service include introducing premium economy seats on selected long-haul flights and new food menus. Henry H Harteveldt, the president of Atmosphere Research Group, said the Tata Group’s investments may help to build a foundation for Air India to succeed, but the changes will not matter much if the airline does not manage to be reliable and punctual. Above all else, Air India should strive to be seen as “the on-time machine”, Harteveldt told Al Jazeera. “If a service isn’t considered reliable, customers won’t have the confidence to book with that airline,” he said. 		 		 The Tata Group’s biggest challenge of all may be addressing Air India’s damaged relationship with its customers. Apart from recurring issues with reliability and punctuality, the airline’s image has been tarnished by high-profile controversies involving its customer service, such as an incident in February in which an 80-year-old passenger collapsed after being forced to walk 1.5km (2.4 miles) from the plane to the immigration counter due to a shortage of wheelchairs. John Gradek, an expert in aviation management at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, said that Air India’s fleet renewal efforts will fail to revive the airline’s fortunes unless it can establish a “new customer service mindset among its customer-facing staff”, a task that has proven difficult “for many airlines looking to grow their international brand”. More than two years after the Tata Group’s takeover of Air India, the airline’s turnaround plan has completed its first phase. Its achievements so far include a $200m investment in new IT to boost reliability and the recruitment of more than 3,800 new employees across several areas to support growth. Harteveldt said the investment in IT was especially welcome as Air India has been “tech-starved for a long time because of the Indian government’s inability or unwillingness to invest in the airline adequately”. For the Tata Group, the progression has continued into 2024 with the scheduling of new international routes with the newly delivered Airbus A350-900 between Delhi and Dubai. Additional changes, such as consolidating carrier Vistara into Air India, are expected to occupy Tata’s focus for the remainder of 2024, in keeping with Chandrasekaran’s view of consolidation as “an important milestone in the journey to make Air India a truly world-class airline”. There are also internal issues with its subsidiary Air India Express, which has both domestic and international flights. Since Tuesday, it has cancelled at least 90 flights as more than 100 crew members have called in sick at the last minute, essentially a strike action reportedly over pay and related matters. Cancellations across the Indian budget carrier represent owner Tata Group’s second setback in as many months, as Vistara was forced to adjust its schedule with flight cancellations amid a pilot shortage only in April. Harteveldt said the “devil is in the details when it comes to airline mergers”. If the airline teams can “be transparent, even humble”, operational faults can be smoothed out during the integration’s initial months, he said. After being in the government’s hands for more than half a century, Air India’s recovery is expected to take time, Harteveldt said, but there is “no reason in the world why, with the right investments and focus, Air India can’t successfully distinguish itself from other Indian-based airlines”. Wilson said Air India’s long-term goal is to grow its market share to 30 percent both domestically and internationally by 2027. The goal, he said, is to create an airline that is “bold, confident, and vibrant, but also warm and deeply rooted to its rich history, traditions, and warm Indian hospitality”. Still, Wilson said he is under no illusions that the turnaround will happen overnight. “It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/9/after-years-of-decline-air-india-is-betting-millions-on-a-comeback,Al Jazeera,"After decades of decline, Air India is betting billions on a comeback",0
6,Business,"– The Wall Street Journal has announced staff cuts at its Hong Kong bureau as it shifts its “center of gravity in the region” to Singapore, marking the latest blow to the financial hub’s once-thriving media industry. Editor-in-chief Emma Tucker told staff in a company-wide memo on Thursday that the newspaper was following the same path that “many of the companies we cover have done”. The cuts include six editorial staff in Hong Kong and two reporters at the newspaper’s Singapore office, two sources familiar with the matter told Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity. In her memo, Tucker said “some of our colleagues, mostly in Hong Kong, will be leaving us”, while listing several new positions in Singapore, including an editor and several reporters. “At the core of these changes is the creation of a new Business, finance and economics group,” she said. “This unites what had been separate teams under one banner with a common goal: Focus on the biggest money stories in Asia – the rise of China’s EV industry, the chip war, China Shock 2.0, the struggles of Hong Kong’s finance industry and China’s stunning property bust.” The WSJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since the imposition of a Beijing-decreed national security law and some of the world’s toughest pandemic curbs in 2020, numerous international companies have departed Hong Kong or scaled bank operations in the city, shifting resources elsewhere. China’s economic slowdown has also impacted the work of the army of analysts and financiers who thrived in Hong Kong’s once-free-wheeling atmosphere, in turn informing the coverage of media outlets such as the WSJ. Earlier this year, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell to its lowest levels since 1997, the year the former British colony was returned to Chinese sovereignty, in what was widely seen as an ominous sign for the future of the city’s economy – although the market has rebounded over 10 percent during the last month. Hundreds of thousands of expatriate and local residents have departed the city in recent years, many of them driven to leave by harsh zero-COVID curbs and a national security crackdown that has weakened rights and freedoms that are supposed to be guaranteed until 2047 under an arrangement known as “one country, two systems”. Mainland Chinese and Hong Kong officials have argued that a greater focus on national security has been necessary to restore peace and stability to the city after mass antigovernment protests in 2019 that devolved into widespread property destruction and clashes with police. Several local independent news outlets have shuttered under political pressure, while international media including The New York Times and Radio Free Asia have shifted editorial positions to cities such as Seoul and Taipei. Once known as one of the freest media environments in Asia, Hong Kong ranks 135 out of 180 countries and territories in Reporters without Borders’ (RSF) latest media freedom index released on Friday, falling between the Philippines and South Sudan. Last month, Hong Kong immigration authorities   who visited the city to attend the ongoing national security trial of media tycoon Jimmy Lai.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/3/wall-street-journal-cuts-hong-kong-staff-shifts-focus-to-singapore,Al Jazeera,"Wall Street Journal cuts Hong Kong staff, shifts focus to Singapore",0
7,Business,"European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen has said she will push for competition with China that is “fair and not distorted” in talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “I have made clear that the current imbalances in market access are not sustainable and need to be addressed,” von der Leyen, who is the president of the EU Commission, said hours ahead of a meeting between her, Xi and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. Xi on Sunday began a three-country tour of Europe as EU officials are probing the trade practices of Chinese firms operating in the bloc. The European Commission last week opened an investigation to determine if European suppliers of medical devices are given fair market access in China. The inquiry follows similar probes into Chinese wind turbine suppliers and Chinese subsidies for solar panels, electric vehicles (EVs) and trains. European carmakers such as Volkswagen and Renault are losing ground to   makers, which have received billions of dollars worth of state subsidies in recent years. EU officials are also concerned about Chinese spying and Beijing’s military cooperation with Russia as Moscow prosecutes its war on Ukraine. Von der Leyen on Sunday reiterated the bloc’s position that it should “derisk” ties with China but not decouple from the world’s second-largest economy, in contrast with Washington’s aggressive moves to shut out key Chinese industries entirely. “We have been very clear-eyed about our relationship with China, which is one of the most complex, but also one of the most important,” she said. But Von der Leyen said the EU could not accept “market-distorting practices”. “China is currently manufacturing, with massive subsidies, more than it is selling due to its own weak domestic demand. This is leading to an oversupply of Chinese subsidised goods, such as EVs and steel, that is leading to unfair trade,” she said. Von der Leyen said she would encourage Xi to address “overcapacities” in the short term. Xi’s visit is seen as a test of the EU’s efforts to walk a fine line between Beijing and Washington, with the Chinese leader widely expected to attempt to exploit divisions between Western allies. While European leaders have qualms about Beijing’s growing power and influence, the bloc is divided over how to respond to the heated US-China rivalry. Macron, who is treating Xi to the formal honours of a full state visit, has often warned against Europe becoming a US vassal and is widely seen to be attempting to forge a third way in geopolitical relations. “In Europe, we are not unanimous on the subject because certain players still see China as essentially a market of opportunities,” Macron said in an interview with French newspaper La Tribune ahead of Xi’s visit. After a two-day visit to France, Xi will travel to Serbia and Hungary, both of which are seen as friendly with Beijing.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/6/eus-von-der-leyen-to-urge-fair-china-competition-in-talks-with-xi,Al Jazeera,EU’s von der Leyen to urge ‘fair’ China competition in talks with Xi,0
8,Business,"ByteDance, the owner of the  , has filed a lawsuit against the United States government in an effort to block a law that would force it to  . On Tuesday, lawyers for ByteDance filed the complaint in the US Court of Appeals in Washington, DC, arguing the law was “obviously unconstitutional”. President Joe Biden signed the law less than two weeks ago, on April 24, as part of a package that included foreign aid to Ukraine and Israel, as well as humanitarian relief for Gaza. Under the law, ByteDance has nine months to sell off its US-based operations. Its deadline is January 19, with an additional three-month extension possible should a sale be in progress. But in its suit, ByteDance argues divestment will not be possible within the timeframe allotted — “not commercially, not technologically, not legally”. It also argues it is being unfairly targeted by a law that violates the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which protects free speech. “For the first time in history, Congress has enacted a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community with more than 1 billion people worldwide,” the lawsuit reads. While ByteDance maintained it has no plans to sell TikTok, its  , it said that doing so   under the law. Millions of lines of code would have to shift hands, the lawsuit explained, and any prospective owners would have to access ByteDance’s algorithms to keep it operational — something that would also be barred under the law. “There is no question: the Act will force a shutdown of TikTok by January 19, 2025, silencing the 170 million Americans who use the platform to communicate in ways that cannot be replicated elsewhere,” the lawsuit said. TikTok has been a target of bipartisan criticism in the US, with politicians concerned about its national security implications. ByteDance is a Chinese technology company, and its critics fear that the Chinese government could request the information it collects from users, raising privacy concerns. US Congress members like Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi said the April law is therefore necessary to protect US users. “This is the only way to address the national security threat posed by ByteDance’s ownership of apps like TikTok,” he said in a statement on Tuesday. “Instead of continuing its deceptive tactics, it’s time for ByteDance to start the divestment process.” 		 		 ByteDance has long denied furnishing any information about US users to the Chinese government, and it has publicly pledged not to do so, brushing aside such concerns as “speculative”. The lawsuit also notes that the company spent $2bn to protect US user data and has made commitments under a 90-page draft “National Security Agreement” with the US government. TikTok has been in the US government’s crosshairs for nearly four years, as tensions continue between Washington and Beijing. In 2020, for instance, former President Donald Trump signed an executive order to ban the video platform, citing national security concerns. But federal judges blocked the ban, saying that officials demonstrated a “failure to consider an obvious and reasonable alternative before banning TikTok”. States have similarly sought to block the app, most notably Montana. In April 2023, Governor Greg Gianforte signed a first-of-its-kind bill, SB 419, that would fine TikTok for operating within state lines, as well as any app stores that carried it. But it was unclear how Montana planned to enforce the law, which was quickly challenged in court. Montana’s SB 419 was scheduled to take effect on January 1, but a federal judge ultimately blocked it, awarding another win to ByteDance. The state’s attorney general has promised an appeal. 		 		 Many free-speech advocates   awaits April’s federal law forcing ByteDance to sever itself from its US operations. Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, told the Associated Press that he anticipated ByteDance would prevail in Tuesday’s lawsuit. “The First Amendment means the government can’t restrict Americans’ access to ideas, information, or media from abroad without a very good reason for it — and no such reason exists here,” Jaffer said in a statement. For its part, China has taken similar actions against US-based companies like Meta, whose WhatsApp and Threads platforms were recently ordered to be removed from Chinese-based app stores over questions of national security.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/7/tiktok-owner-bytedance-files-lawsuit-against-us-law-forcing-apps-sale,Al Jazeera,TikTok owner ByteDance files lawsuit against US law forcing app’s sale,0
9,Business,"Toyota has reported record profit and sales figures on the back of the weak yen and strong demand for hybrid vehicles. The Japanese car giant said on Wednesday that it netted a record profit of 4.94 trillion yen ($31.9bn) in the year to March on revenues of 45.1 trillion yen, double the previous year’s income. Global sales topped 10.3 million units, an all-time high, buoyed by strong demand in the home market and in North America and Europe. Sales of hybrid vehicles jumped 31 percent to 3.7 million units. The financial results far exceeded a company forecast in February of a 4.5 trillion yen net profit on revenues of 43.5 trillion yen. Toyota offered a more sober outlook for the current year, estimating profit would fall nearly 28 percent due to increased investment. The carmaker aims to sell 10.95 million vehicles worldwide this year, down 1.3 percent from 2023. “We’ll make investments in order to firmly protect the supply chain from a perspective of sustainable growth,” Toyota CEO Koji Sato said at a news conference after the release of the results. “The latest results show that our efforts have borne fruit, but we need [to] keep growing with the vision to become a mobility company,” Sato added. While Toyota blazed a trail in the hybrid space with the release of the Prius in 1997, it has faced criticism for being slow to embrace fully electric cars. Toyota sold just 116,500 fully electric vehicles in 2023, while China’s BYD and Tesla shifted about 1.6 million and 1.8 million, respectively. Nevertheless, Toyota’s hybrid-first strategy has paid dividends over the last year amid falling demand for electric vehicles in the United States and Europe. Despite falling behind Tesla and BYD in the electric vehicles space, Toyota, which offers more than two dozen hybrid models, has held the title of the world’s largest automaker by sales for four straight years. In January, Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda expressed scepticism that battery electric vehicles would ever dominate the market, predicting they would peak at about 30 percent of sales.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/8/japans-toyota-posts-record-profit-as-hybrid-sales-surge-31-percent,Al Jazeera,Japan’s Toyota posts record profit as bet on hybrids pays dividends,0
10,Business,"​​Australia’s flagship airline Qantas has agreed to pay $120 million Australian dollars ($79m) to settle a lawsuit over the sale of tickets for already cancelled flights. The airline will pay a fine of 100 million Australian dollars ($66m) and provide compensation of 20 million Australian dollars ($13m) to more than 86,000 customers after advertising seats for thousands of “ghost flights” in 2021 and 2022. “Qantas’ conduct was egregious and unacceptable. Many consumers will have made holiday, Business and travel plans after booking on a phantom flight that had been cancelled,” said Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairperson Gina Cass-Gottlieb in a statement on Monday. “Importantly, it demonstrates that we take action to ensure that companies operating in Australia communicate clearly, accurately and honestly with their customers at all times,” Cass-Gottlieb added. Qantas Group CEO Vanessa Hudson said the settlement, which is subject to court approval, was an “important step forward as we work towards restoring confidence in the national carrier.” “When flying resumed after the COVID shutdown, we recognise Qantas let down customers and fell short of our own standards. We know many of our customers were affected by our failure to provide cancellation notifications in a timely manner and we are sincerely sorry,” Hudson said. “The return to travelling was already stressful for many and we did not deliver enough support for customers and did not have the technology and systems in place to support our people.” Qantas, which reported an annual profit of $1.1bn last year, has faced a barrage of controversies in recent years over rising ticket prices, claims of poor service standards, and the firing of 1,700 ground staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.

11,Business,"Boeing has called off the inaugural crewed flight CST-100 Starliner space capsule after engineers detected an issue with a rocket valve. The decision to call off the launch on Monday came two hours before the scheduled liftoff and about an hour after two NASA astronauts had strapped into the spacecraft. The postponement, blamed on a problem with a valve in the Atlas V rocket, was announced during a live NASA webcast. “Standing down on tonight’s attempt to launch,” NASA chief Bill Nelson said in a post on X. “As I’ve said before, @NASA’s first priority is safety. We go when we’re ready.” It was not immediately clear how long it would take to address the problem, but the next available launch windows for the launch are Tuesday, Thursday and Friday nights. Standing down on tonight’s attempt to launch  . As I’ve said before,  ’s first priority is safety. We go when we’re ready.  — Bill Nelson (@SenBillNelson)  The Starliner had been due to transport NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station (ISS), where they would have spent a week before returning to Earth. The Starliner’s inaugural voyage to the ISS has been closely watched as a sign of Boeing’s ability to rival Elon Musk’s SpaceX for NASA contracts. NASA in 2014 awarded multibillion-dollar contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to develop space capsules for the space agency to ferry astronauts and cargo into space. The contracts marked the start of a shift by NASA towards public-private partnerships following the end of its space shuttle program. SpaceX’s Dragon successfully transported astronauts to the ISS in 2020, marking the first time NASA astronauts had launched from US soil in a commercially-built spacecraft. Starliner flew its first uncrewed mission to ISS in 2022, after an unsuccessful attempt three years earlier.

12,Business,"Ever since he can remember, Rohit Kumar Sahu knew he wanted to go to college and get a well-paying, white-collar job. His father delivered courier packages across the eastern Indian city of Ranchi on a bicycle, and Sahu had no idea how to realise his dream. He signed up for a job with the food delivery app Zomato, thinking this could be his path to earning money to pay for college fees. Sahu began with just a few hours of work so he could attend college alongside his job, but he could’t make enough deliveries on his bicycle — and that meant he couldn’t earn much. He took a loan from friends and a finance company and bought a scooter so he could take on more work. Even as the loan repayments kicked in, Zomato reduced its payment to delivery workers like Sahu, and he got fewer deliveries as more drivers joined the app. Sahu scaled up his work to as much as 14 hours a day, going to college only to take exams, but he still had to borrow money from his parents for loan repayments. Frustrated, Sahu and other drivers in Ranchi staged a strike asking to be paid better. But, Sahu says, company officials told them they could hire others from India’s growing army of bike riders instead and could block the strikers from the app. This broke the strike – and left Sahu with loans and his dream of college and a steady job seeming more distant than before. Sahu is among a growing number of Indians bearing the brunt of the increasing informalisation of work in India. The India Employment Report 2024, a study released in March by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Institute for Human Development, says that India’s workforce is getting more informalised and that the quality of employment has suffered especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sahu’s experience is characteristic not only of India’s growing gig economy, but also seems symptomatic of the broader employment landscape. About 70 percent of India’s construction workers and 62 percent of its casual agricultural workers earn salaries below minimum wage, found the study, which uses government data. Even in the formal sector, about 18 percent of workers did not have work contracts that could protect them. They also had fewer benefits than before, the study found. While India’s economy is pegged to grow at a robust 6.5 percent in the financial year ending March 2025, according to the United Nations Trade and Development, its ability to create quality jobs to meet the aspirations of its increasingly educated youth has emerged as one of the key issues of the national election currently under way. Jayati Ghosh, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, wrote in a recent column, “With tens of millions of highly educated young people joining the workforce every year, unmet expectations and growing social unrest threaten to turn the country’s much-anticipated ‘demographic dividend’ into a disaster”. Not surprisingly, opposition leaders such as Rahul Gandhi have accused the government of “destroying employment”. INDIA bloc, the coalition of opposition parties that Gandhi’s Congress Party is a part of, has announced that it will create a right to apprenticeship that could lead to a job for young people if the coalition is elected. While recent reports have pegged employment differently, the quality of jobs seems more tenuous than before. “There has been a slippage in the quality of jobs,” said Amit Basole, head of the Centre for Sustainable Employment at the Azim Premji University in Bengaluru. Ravi Srivastava, one of the lead authors of the India Employment Report and director of the  New Delhi-based Institute for Human Development’s Centre for Employment Studies, said “The share of informal workers in the economy went up.” Nearly 90 percent of the workforce is informally employed, the report says. Self-employment as a form of work grew 3.8 percentage points between 2019 and 2022, while regular employment declined to 21.5 percent from 23.8 percent. The share of casual employment declined to 22.7 percent in 2022 from 24.2 percent in 2019. Basole noted, “We see a shift since the 2000s, with a destruction of jobs at the lower end.” This trend seems to have accentuated sharply after 2019, when the pandemic hit, and millions were pushed into more insecure employment as the country went into a sudden lockdown overnight and Businesses big and small shut, with many of the latter never recovering from that shock. With workers back in their villages, agriculture saw an increase in workers of nearly 56 million from 2020 to 2022, reversing a slow trend of workers moving from agriculture into more value-added service sector jobs, the report said. Women also increasingly entered the workforce during this period, but a little more than half of them did unpaid work in agriculture, usually on family farms, Srivastava said, adding that it is a trend that has continued. “The data shows the precarity of women’s work. The degree of informality for women workers is higher than for men,” he said. Work for both men and women may have remained precarious even after the pandemic as men often returned to big cities for jobs in construction or in the gig economy, both areas with little security. The Indian government has objected to the ILO report and its employment estimates, adding that the growing gig sector was not well accounted for in the report. India’s government think-tank, NITI Aayog, estimated that 7.7 million people worked in such jobs in 2020-2021. It expects more than 23.5 million workers could be employed in gig work by 2029-2030. Srivastava says that while it is hard to estimate the number of gig workers, the total has only gone up since the pandemic. In cities, too – as not all shops, restaurants and salons had reopened – women were forced to take up gig work. In May 2022, Mumbai beautician Gurpreet Sharma’s two fingers got stuck together while fixing nail extensions for a client. Unsticking them with oil had led to swelling and burns on her fingers, limiting her ability to work or do household chores for months. Urban Company, a platform offering at-home services through which she got the job, did not provide her medical insurance since it covered only hospitalisation. Months later, with her husband’s work as an assistant dance choreographer in Bollywood getting more irregular, Sharma once again restarted work with Urban Company. A client’s dogs bit her while she was at a home pedicure appointment. She had pressed the app’s emergency button, but to no avail. The client paid for Sharma’s anti-rabies shots after she filed a police complaint. Another time, a friend accepted on the Urban Company app a job of doing a facial for a man. But she fled that client’s house unpaid because of sexual advances he made. Like Sahu, Sharma and her Urban Company colleagues have spent the last two years trying to form a union. They asked to be called employees rather than partners and get benefits accordingly, but to no avail. Pratik Mishra, of the All India Gig Workers Union, which had helped Sahu in organising efforts, said he had worked with unions in Ranchi’s large coal and steel sector for years, but what he encountered with delivery workers was like nothing he had seen before. “They were so replaceable, the company did not even consider them to be workers and they could get blocked by an algorithm anytime. They were so vulnerable.” After his fiasco with unionising, Sahu looked for other means to fund his studies and joined a loan collection agency where his job was to make calls to chase outstanding dues along with occasional food deliveries. Now 22, he has also enrolled for a master’s degree in computer applications, along with preparing for several of India’s competitive exams for coveted, and stable, federal government jobs. He can hardly afford to attend college due to work commitments, and he studies through free tutorials on YouTube. He is downbeat about his job prospects. More than 400,000 applicants take the exams for less than 12,000 government jobs. “Kya chance hai?” he asks rhetorically. “What are my chances?” Then he answers himself: “0.001 percent”. Tapping into this aspiration for government jobs, Tejashwi Yadav, the opposition leader from Sahu’s neighbouring state of Bihar, has announced that the opposition INDIA bloc will provide 10 million jobs, partly by filling open government positions. For now, Sahu worries he is not developing the skills he needs through the practical training that the college provides, but the need to earn money has limited his choices. “Hum to saari taraf se phas rahe hain [We are trapped all around],” he said, referring to his job prospects. Alexandra Hermann, lead economist in London at Oxford Economics, said a major “impediment [to creating quality jobs] has been human capital levels”. Just as Sahu worries about the skills he’s acquiring, surveys have shown that learning levels have been low in Indian schools and colleges although enrolment is up. Government spending on infrastructure development has led to the creation of construction jobs rather than the service sector jobs that India’s increasingly educated youth such as Sahu aspire to, Hermann pointed out, adding, that those are “not necessarily the kind of jobs we want”. It is time for the government to spend on improving educational levels and creating service sector jobs, she said. The Indian employment report also found that when students do get a higher education, it leads to better employment. Lal Singh, a 24-year-old from Mumbai, earned enough money from food delivery jobs to pay for courses that enabled him to become an app developer, the job he dreamed of. Growing up, Singh’s father had sold magazines at Mumbai’s busy traffic signals, and the family lived in a packed slum in the city’s southern tip. But Singh had grown up playing video games and idolising Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. While in college, he had joined a skills training course by the non-profit Antarang and found a job with a software company. While there, he continued doing courses to upgrade his skills. He now develops apps for United States companies, but is finding it hard to move to a better role in the currently tight job market. But Singh’s success is not easy to replicate. While more Indians are getting a college education than before –  and the enrollment for women in science degrees is among the highest in the world, according to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman – more than 83 percent of India’s unemployed are among the youth, the ILO report says. Sahu’s exam for a government job is in July, but juggling between loan collection work, deliveries, college and test preparation means he constantly feels he is failing somewhere, and the prospect of landing a good job is only getting more difficult. When things get hard, Singh occasionally turns back to food delivery.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/6/india-elections-focus-on-increasing-informalisation-of-work-for-youth,Al Jazeera,"A good, steady job?

13,Business,"The United States has revoked some licences that allow companies to ship goods, such as chips, to sanctioned Chinese telecommunications equipment maker Huawei Technologies. Some companies were notified on Tuesday that their licences were revoked effective immediately, according to one person familiar with the matter. The move comes after the release last month of Huawei’s first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro powered by Intel’s new Core Ultra 9 processor. The laptop launch drew fire from Republican lawmakers, who said it suggested that the US Department of Commerce had given the green light to Intel to sell the chip to Huawei. “We have revoked certain licenses for exports to Huawei,” the Commerce Department said in a statement, declining to specify which ones it had withdrawn. The move, first reported by Reuters, comes after concerted pressure by Republican China hawks in Congress who have been urging the Biden administration to take tougher action to thwart Huawei. “This action will bolster US national security, protect American ingenuity, and diminish Communist China’s ability to advance its technology,” Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik said in a statement. Depending on which licences were revoked, the move could also hurt Huawei which still relies on Intel chips to power its laptops, and could hurt US suppliers that do business with the company. A spokesperson for Intel declined to comment. Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Huawei was placed on a US trade restriction list in 2019 amid fears it could spy on Americans, part of a broader effort to handicap China’s ability to bolster its military. Being added to the list means the company’s suppliers have to seek a special, difficult-to-obtain licence before shipping. Even so, suppliers to Huawei have received licences worth billions of dollars to sell Huawei goods and technology, including one particularly controversial authorization, issued by the administration of former President Donald Trump, which has allowed Intel to ship central processors to Huawei for use in its laptops since 2020. Qualcomm has sold older 4G chips to handsets since receiving a licence from US officials in 2020. In a regulatory filing earlier this month, Qualcomm said it did not expect to receive more chip revenue from Huawei beyond this year. However, Qualcomm still licenses its portfolio of 5G technologies to Huawei, which last year began using a 5G chip designed by its HiSilicon unit that most analysts believe is manufactured in violation of US sanctions. Qualcomm said in the filing this month that its patent deal with Huawei expires early in Qualcomm’s fiscal 2025 and that it has started negotiations to renew the deal. Qualcomm did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Critics argue such licences have contributed to the company’s resurgence. Huawei shocked the industry last August with a new phone powered by a sophisticated chip manufactured by Chinese chipmaker SMIC, despite US export restrictions on both companies. The phone helped Huawei smartphone sales spike 64 percent year on year in the first six weeks of 2024, according to research firm Counterpoint. Its smart car component business has also contributed to Huawei’s resurgence, with the company notching its fastest revenue growth in four years in 2023.",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/5/8/us-cancels-export-licenses-of-suppliers-to-chinas-huawei,Al Jazeera,US cancels export licences of suppliers to China’s Huawei,0

Israel ordered the confiscation of 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres) of land belonging to Palestinian citizens of Israel in the Galilee. These plans were part of Israeli state policy to Judaise Galilee following the creation of the state of Israel. The confiscated land is roughly the size of 3,000 football pitches or the area from the tip of Manhattan to Central Park in New York, US. Palestinians, both inside Israel and across the occupied territory, mark this day by holding protests and vigils and planting olive trees to reaffirm their connection to the land. The protests are often met with brutal use of force by Israel. Yes, Israel has continued to seize large swaths of Palestinian land, designating them as military zones, state land and other labels. Most recently, on March 22, 2024, Israel’s Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich   (1,977 acres) in the occupied West Bank, in a move that would facilitate building more illegal settlements. “While there are those in Israel and in the world who seek to undermine our right to Judea and Samaria and the country in general, we promote settlement through hard work and in a strategic manner all over the country,” Smotrich said, using Biblical names for the area that are commonly heard in Israel. Settlements – illegal under international law – are   in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. On March 6, Israel’s settlement-planning authority announced it had approved the construction of   in Maale Adumim, Kedar and Efrat within the occupied West Bank. From November 1, 2022 to October 31, 2023, Israel has approved at least 24,000 illegal housing units to be built on Palestinian land. Earlier this month, the United Nations’ High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said settlements had expanded by a record amount and risked eliminating any possibility of a Palestinian state.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/30/land-day-what-happened-in-palestine-in-1976,Al Jazeera,Land Day: What happened in Palestine in 1976?,3
17,Entertainment,"As the sun goes down during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, many Muslims will break their fasts with a sweet, brown, dried fruit that has ancient history in the region. During these  , able-bodied, observant Muslims abstain from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual relations during daylight hours to achieve greater “taqwa”, or consciousness of God. Breaking one’s fast with dates and water is rooted in the religious teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and is specifically mentioned in the Quran for its nutritional value. Dates, fresh or dried, contain important vitamins, minerals and fibre. They are also high in antioxidants. Given their high level of fructose, a natural sugar found in fruit, dates are a great source of energy, especially after a long day’s fast. There are many different varieties of dates, each with different tastes and textures: : known for their large size, sweet taste, amber colour and richness in flavour  less sweet than other kinds of dates with an elongated shape, reddish-brown hue and chewiness  have a soft, fleshy, almost juicy feel, are very sweet and are among the dates most revered by Muslims because they are grown in Medina, Saudi Arabia  medium-sized, lighter in colour and ideal for cooking and baking  darker skin, rich flavour, slightly drier and known for their unique taste Dates have been cultivated for thousands of years. Date palm trees are either male or female, and only the female plant produces fruit. A mature date palm can produce more than 100kg (220lb) of dates per harvest season – about 10,000 dates. The Ajwa date is the most expensive date in the world. In 2022, according to   a food and agriculture database, about 10 billion kilogrammes (22 billion pounds) of dates were produced worldwide. Dates tend to thrive in countries with long, hot summers like those in the Middle East and neighbouring regions. Egypt is the world’s top date producer, producing nearly one in five, or 18 percent, of the world’s dates, according to Tridge. Saudi Arabia follows at nearly 17 percent with Algeria rounding off the top three at 13 percent. The infographic below shows where most of the world’s dates come from: Israel is one of the world’s largest exporters of dates, selling $330m of medjool dates abroad in 2022, according to Tridge. During Israel’s nearly six-month war on Gaza, which has killed more than   people, several groups have called for a boycott of Israel-related products. One such group is the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement ( ), a Palestinian-led initiative that seeks to challenge international support for what it calls Israeli apartheid and settler colonialism. BDS has urged consumers to always check labels and not buy dates that are produced or packaged in Israel or its settlements in the occupied West Bank, which are illegal under international law. They recommend avoiding the following brands:",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/31/ramadan-2024-where-do-your-dates-come-from,Al Jazeera,Ramadan 2024: Where do your dates come from?,3
18,Entertainment,"As a new moon was not   on Monday evening after Maghrib prayers, Muslims in Saudi Arabia and neighbouring countries will fast one more day, completing 30 days of Ramadan. The first day of Eid will then be celebrated on Wednesday, April 10. The first day of Eid al-Fitr is determined by the sighting of the crescent moon marking the start of the month of Shawwal, the 10th month of the Islamic (Hijri) calendar. Lunar months last between 29 and 30 days so Muslims usually have to wait until the night before Eid to verify its date. Other countries follow independent sightings. When the sighting has been verified, Eid is declared on television, radio stations and at mosques. Traditionally, Eid is celebrated for three days as an official holiday in Muslim-majority countries. However, the number of holiday days varies by country. Muslims begin Eid day celebrations by partaking in a prayer service that takes place shortly after dawn, followed by a short sermon. On their way to the prayer, which is traditionally held in an open area, Muslims recite takbeerat, praising God by saying “Allahu Akbar”, meaning “God is great”. It is customary to eat something sweet before the prayer, such as  -filled biscuits known as maamoul in the Middle East. This particular festival is known as the “sweet” Eid – and the distribution of sweets is common across the Muslim world. Muslims usually spend the day visiting relatives and neighbours and accepting sweets as they move around from house to house. Each country has traditional desserts and sweets that are prepared before Eid or on the morning of the first day. Children, dressed in new clothes, are offered gifts and money to celebrate the joyous occasion. Girls and women in many countries decorate their hands with henna. The celebration for Eid begins the night before as women gather in neighbourhoods and large family gatherings for the application of henna. In some countries, families visit graveyards to offer their respects to departed family members right after the morning prayers. It is common for Muslim-majority countries to decorate their cities with lights and hold festivities to commemorate the end of the fasting month. For some 2.3 million Palestinians in Gaza this Eid, this will be the first Muslim religious holiday after more than   people have been killed in Israeli attacks. With little   aid, and very limited water, Gaza’s Eid al-Fitr will be mired in destruction amid the continuing attacks. The most popular greeting is “Eid Mubarak” (Blessed Eid) or “Eid sa’id” (Happy Eid). Eid greetings also vary depending on the country and language.

19,Entertainment,"It has been six months since Israel launched its brutal assault on the Gaza Strip on October 7. Israel shows no sign of stopping, as its allies continue to provide it with more weapons to use on Palestinians along with political support, and mediated talks have not led to a ceasefire. The war on Gaza, Israel says, is in retaliation for attacks on Israeli territory by armed groups, led by Hamas’s Qassam Brigades, from Gaza which killed 1,139 people and took about 250 captive. Let’s take a look at the toll the Israeli attacks have taken on Gaza. At least 33,137 Palestinians have been   by the Israeli army in Gaza since the start of the war on October 7, the Ministry of Health in Gaza says. Thousands more are missing under the rubble of collapsed buildings and infrastructure, and are presumed dead. Children and women comprise the overwhelming majority of those killed, with Save the Children saying more than 13,800 children have been killed. UNICEF, the United Nations fund for children, estimated that at least 17,000 Palestinian children are currently unaccompanied or separated from their parents in Gaza. At least 75,815 people have been injured in Israeli attacks since the start of the war – about four out of every 100 people in Gaza. The Palestine Red Crescent Society said this week that some 1,000 children in Gaza have lost one or both of their legs. Dozens of people are still killed and injured every day amid relentless Israeli attacks. The humanitarian situation in Gaza has grown significantly worse in 2024 as the Israeli army blocks the arrival of aid and has effectively imposed   as a weapon of war. Nearly all 2.3 million people trapped in Gaza now face starvation, with the UN saying famine will take hold in various parts of Gaza by May. Northern Gaza, which was the first to be decimated by an Israeli ground invasion, is the worst-hit – Israel continues to severely restrict access to the north, blocking routes and subjecting aid convoys to delays or cancellations. Babies and young children have died from dehydration and malnutrition in northern Gaza, but Israel is still blocking many humanitarian missions. Last week, Israeli forces   in three targeted, consecutive strikes on a convoy of cars over a stretch of 2.3km (1.4 miles), prompting some aid organisations to suspend services. The Israeli military ordered Palestinians to “go south” from the start of the war as its ground forces invaded Gaza from the north. Nobody has been able to return to their homes in northern Gaza since then as Israel has established a military corridor cutting the Strip in half. Some 1.9 million people, or more than 80 percent of Gaza’s population, have been internally  . Most are sheltering in UN installations such as schools and hospitals, nevertheless, more than 400 have been killed and at least 1,400 injured in those places. More than 1.5 million people are now crammed into Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city on the border with Egypt. Many have been forced to stay in makeshift camps or the streets, exposed to Israeli air attacks. Israel has insisted it will invade Rafah by land as well. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) says more than 350 Israeli military attacks have targeted its buildings, with 161 installations damaged. The highest number of UN staff in history – 176 – have been killed in Gaza since October 7. The war has damaged or destroyed approximately 62 percent of all homes in Gaza – 290,820 housing units – leaving more than a million people without homes. The   estimated by the World Bank and the UN has also been to public service infrastructure, with 26 million tonnes of debris and rubble left by the destruction. Damage has been most extensive in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, where Israeli ground and air attacks destroyed thousands of homes and infrastructure in a stated effort to combat “terrorists”. Eight of every 10 schools in Gaza are damaged or destroyed, according to UNICEF. As many as 625,000 students have no access to education. The Israeli army has focused its attacks on hospitals across Gaza despite their protection under international law, claiming Hamas is operating within and underneath them. All hospitals have suffered critical damage, with only 10 out of 36 able to function partially but they are increasingly overburdened. A two-week-long siege in and around al-Shifa Hospital, the largest in Gaza,   by last week. The Israeli army killed at least 400 people at the compound during its siege and arrested hundreds more. An acute shortage of medicine, along with exhausted and starving healthcare professionals, means most patients are unable to receive treatment in Gaza. Many operations and amputations have had to be performed without anaesthetic. The Israeli army has killed the largest number of journalists of any modern conflict and detained more than 24. On March 18, Al Jazeera correspondent   was arrested for 12 hours and beaten by Israeli forces in al-Shifa Hospital. Before that, on January 7, Al Jazeera journalist Hamza Dahdouh, son of Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh, was  .

Abudaqa bled to death over four hours as emergency workers were unable to reach him because the Israeli army would not let them. The Committee to Protect Journalists puts the number of journalists killed at 90, with the Government Media Office in Gaza saying some 140 have been killed.

21,Politics,"The United States House of Representatives has voted overwhelmingly to defeat an effort by Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene to remove Speaker Mike Johnson, a fellow Republican. In an unusual move, Democrats joined Republicans in a 359-43 vote on Wednesday to keep Johnson in his leadership role and stave off further turmoil in the House. “I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort,” Johnson said following the vote. “Hopefully this is the end of the character assassination that has characterised the current Congress.” Hardline Representative Greene has, for weeks, sought to get Johnson kicked out after a string of compromises he made with Democrats over a   for security assistance to US allies Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. Greene is a leading voice of the far-right flank opposed to helping Ukraine. After the House passed the bill in April, she called Johnson a “lame duck”. Johnson’s leadership was “pathetic, weak, and unacceptable”, Greene said on Wednesday as she triggered the “motion to vacate” measure. 		 		 The same procedure was used to remove former Republican Speaker   in October, the first time in US history that the House voted to remove its leader. Republicans have a slim 217-213 majority in the House. Most opposed the vote to remove Johnson, with only 11 in favour and 196 against. “As I’ve said from the beginning, and I’ve made clear here every day, I intend to do my job,” Johnson said. “And I’ll let the chips fall where they may. In my view, that is leadership.” Democrats, led by Representative Hakeem Jeffries, had promised to keep Johnson in his seat, with 163 against the motion. “Our decision to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene from plunging the country into further chaos is rooted in our commitment to solve problems,” Jeffries, the House Minority Leader, said after the vote. Greene’s move represented a rare Republican defiance of presumptive presidential candidate Donald Trump, who in a social media post following the House vote said it was “not the time” for Republicans to try to push out their own speaker. “This is not an individual who knows how to lead,” Republican Marcus Molinaro said of Greene after the vote. “She’s not an individual who knows how to negotiate. And she certainly doesn’t seem to have any concern for the stability of the Congress or the people we represent.” Some Republicans said she could face disciplinary action for attempting to sow disunity in the party.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/us-house-blocks-bid-to-remove-speaker-mike-johnson,Al Jazeera,US House blocks bid to remove Speaker Mike Johnson,1

23,Politics,"“The Chinese take great pride in their food,” read a memo prepared for United States President Richard Nixon ahead of his groundbreaking visit to the People’s Republic of China in 1972. Nixon’s lavish state banquet with Chinese premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing, broadcast live across the world, was crucial in improving US public opinion of a country that had been hidden from view for decades. More than half a century later, food is once again playing a central role in nurturing warmer US-China relations. With   and   both recently wrapping up their second visits to China in less than a year, meals have emerged as a key ingredient in stabilising ties between the two countries, as officials on both sides look to tap into the potential of what has been called “food diplomacy”. Yellen’s visit in early April was notable for the level of Chinese public attention on her food choices. Anticipation was high after her first visit last July, when her choice of a Beijing restaurant serving authentic food from the country’s southern Yunnan province, including mushrooms that can have psychedelic effects if cooked improperly, made her a social media darling in China. This time around, it was not only her choice of authentic Cantonese and Sichuan food that grabbed headlines but also her use of chopsticks at a popular Guangzhou restaurant established in 1880, reminiscent of Nixon’s own chopstick skills that also impressed his hosts in 1972. Although Yellen is known to sample local food during her trips around the US, the symbolic significance of doing so in China was especially pronounced, according to Thomas DuBois, a historian of China who teaches at Beijing Normal University. “In China, food is the language of diplomacy, and the Chinese are rightfully proud of their culinary culture. She [Yellen] knew that how she ate would reflect extremely heavily on her visit,” DuBois told Al Jazeera. “If you’re eating badly in China, because it’s a very food-obsessed culture, it’s more than a sign of bad taste, it’s a sign that there’s something off about you.” DuBois noted that one of the common phrases used to describe Yellen’s eating in China was “qianxu”, or humility – a character trait “extremely important” to the Chinese. “Eating well and knowing how to eat is a profound moral philosophy in China that really comes down to being humble enough to change yourself according to what needs to happen, such as coming here and using chopsticks,” he said. Food’s importance to diplomacy is well-known among foreign diplomats in China. According to a diplomat for a major European country in Beijing, eating together is one of the top priorities when interacting with Chinese officials. “In high-level bilateral meetings, it’s incredibly important to have an eating element in the programme because that’s where you can have an open and frank conversation,” he said, preferring not to be named. “The dinners are used strategically on both sides to create a trusted relationship,” he said. Before the diplomat was posted to Beijing, part of his training related to Chinese banquet customs, including who sits where at the table and the rules surrounding toasting. Ministers from his country are also briefed on these customs before they have meetings with their Chinese counterparts, he added. Even so, banquets can be tricky affairs. In addition to complicated customs, the complex nature of Chinese cuisine, which uses a wide range of ingredients, can lead to challenges in establishing rapport over food, especially with food allergies, which are relatively uncommon in China. At a recent banquet in Beijing arranged by the Chinese, each visiting European minister had a different allergy, from lactose intolerance to shellfish. “A Chinese staffer came over and told me that they had such difficulty planning this dinner for us because our ministers have so many different allergies,” the diplomat said. “These differences in eating habits can complexify things and create lots of stress and anxiety.” The viral seven-second video of Yellen’s chopstick skills was first posted by a social media account believed to be run directly by Beijing. Multiple state-run outlets published the full details of Yellen’s food itinerary, including all the dishes she ate. In an essay on the popular Chinese app WeChat, veteran commentator and former journalist Zhang Feng noted that Chinese state media coverage of Yellen’s more endearing side was a departure from the “cold” reporting on US officials in recent years. “Yellen’s trip to China may somewhat improve the anti-American sentiment of ordinary Chinese people,” Zhang wrote. Chinese public opinion of the US sharply deteriorated during the Donald Trump presidency, who famously ate “Americanised” Chinese food during his state visit in 2017, rebounding slightly since President Joe Biden took office. The warmer coverage is consistent with the Chinese state media’s   on US-China relations in recent months as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) looks to stabilise bilateral relations amid domestic economic challenges. The practice has historical roots. Chinese officials also used food to improve perceptions of the US in the run-up to Nixon’s visit in 1972. Photos of Americans friendly to the regime, such as journalist Edgar Snow, attending various state banquets were widely circulated in both national and internal party newspapers. However, there has also been nationalist pushback against the recent softening of rhetoric. The outspoken tabloid Global Times said in an editorial that “[t]he Chinese people welcome anyone from anywhere to come and enjoy our food, but that does not mean we won’t push back against groundless accusations and outright crackdowns”. Another vocal critic, former Xinhua News Agency journalist Ming Jinwei, accused compatriots of being “hopelessly enamoured” with the US in a WeChat essay and referred to them as “spiritual Americans”. He claimed that the reputation of the US is now “bankrupt” in China, which he described as “a good thing”. The debate over how the CCP should shape domestic opinion towards the US was on display in the much frostier reception Blinken received during his visit in late April, which included meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. While Blinken also ate in authentic restaurants in Shanghai and Beijing, with the US embassy even sharing a clip of him with a popular Chinese food vlogger showing off his chopstick skills, his eating habits received far less attention than Yellen’s. The social media account that had enthused about Yellen’s ability to use chopsticks did not share any videos of Blinken’s culinary adventures. Instead, it emphasised Chinese talking points about the US’s “wrong words and deeds” on various red-line issues at the centre of US-China tensions, including  , the  , and  . On Weibo, China’s equivalent of X, one of the most discussed topics during Blinken’s three-day visit was an interview with the BBC in Beijing in which he was subject to tough questioning over US support for  . The related hashtag for the interview broke into the site’s top 10 most discussed topics on April 28, amassing more than 67 million views as of Tuesday. In contrast, multiple hashtags about Yellen’s eating habits had amassed a total of 39 million views. It is unclear whether the BBC interview went viral organically. Weibo has been accused of rigging its hashtag ranking system before, with hashtags relating to international Politics prone to manipulation. On Saturday evening, the Shanghai restaurant that Blinken visited was about 80 percent full. A staff member said the restaurant’s location in a tourist hotspot meant that they were always busy and that Blinken’s visit had not led to a spike in customers. Nonetheless, other countries have also recognised the power of food diplomacy. On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron thanked the visiting Xi after an hours-long meeting in Paris for his “openness“ to not imposing preemptive tariffs on French cognac. Beijing had launched an anti-dumping investigation into European brandy in January, viewed by some as a response to a European Union probe on Chinese electric vehicles. Macron later took Xi and his wife to the Pyrenees, where they nibbled on cheese and enjoyed some wine. And what did Macron’s going-away gift for Xi include?

24,Politics,"– Troops from the United States and the Philippines have launched Javelin missiles and fired howitzers to simulate repelling a maritime invasion along the coast of the South China Sea, in a show of force capping joint war games held in China’s maritime back yard. The live fire exercises were held throughout the week along the shores of the coastal city of Laoag in northern Ilocos province, the closest mainland Philippine province to China. They capped the largest ever Balikatan, or “shoulder-to-shoulder,” joint military exercises between US and Philippine troops, cementing a dramatic policy shift that has seen Washington and Manila become close allies since Ferdinand Marcos Jr became president in 2022. Tensions have risen amid multiple confrontations between Philippine vessels and the China Coast Guard in the South China Sea. China claims almost the entire area under its nine-dash line, which was rejected by an international tribunal in 2016. While the US and Philippine militaries would not name their adversaries, this year’s exercises were concentrated around the northern and western shores of the Philippines — close to the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. Parts of the drills were also staged in waters outside the Philippines’ 19km (12-mile) territorial limit, and also outside Manila’s exclusive economic zone, which extends for 200 nautical miles (about 370km). “The Philippines and US have a shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific,” US Marines Lieutenant General Michael Cederholm, commander of the Balikatan joint task force, told reporters on Monday. “It’s grounded in the seeking of peaceful solutions. “Make no mistake, if there can’t be a peaceful solution, we have an obligation to our countries to train together.” Ilocos province lies southeast of China and just south of Taiwan, near areas of the South China Sea that would probably be at the centre of any regional conflict over the disputed waters. The US and Philippine militaries fired missiles and used howitzer guns stationed along the shore to sink five platoons standing in for amphibious warships. In northern Batanes, an island province just south of Taiwan, US and Philippine forces simulated the recapture of  . The war games elicited a strong response from China, which managed to disrupt at least one live fire exercise in the South China Sea. The Chinese embassy in Manila did not respond to a request for comment from Al Jazeera. A Chinese warship and two other vessels   as the exercises were held, the Philippine Coast Guard said on Wednesday. The ships left after the coastguard issued a challenge over the radio. This year’s exercises also showcased new US weapons that could be stationed in the Philippines during a conflict. For the first time in the Asia Pacific, the US military deployed a new mid-range missile launcher, called the Typhon. From the northern Philippines, it is able to reach targets in Taiwan, along with Chinese bases and infrastructure in the South China Sea and mainland China. It is the first such weapon deployed in the region since the US withdrew in 2019 from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty that barred the development of ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 2,500km. While the Typhon system was not fired during Balikatan, its deployment now serves to identify launch sites that can be used during a conflict, said Collin Koh, a senior fellow at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. “During wartime, all you need to do is just go straight to these launch sites and you can set it up and fire immediately without further preparation,” Koh said. The US and Philippine militaries also used a hovercraft to land a HIMARS missile system on the western island of Palawan, close to contested areas of the South China Sea. Last year, the militaries tried and failed to land a HIMARS system at the main port of Batanes. This year, the US military  , along with a warehouse and other military infrastructure, as part of an effort to develop functional seaports to offload equipment and troops. “The longer you stay in the port, the more vulnerable you are,” Koh said. “When you are unloading all your equipment and your troops, that is when you are exposed essentially as a sitting duck.” Last year, Washington and Manila announced that four military bases would be added to the  , allowing US troops to utilise a total of nine military sites in the Philippines for training, refuelling and other operations. Three of those bases are in the northern provinces of Cagayan and Isabela, both close to the Luzon Strait running between the Philippines and Taiwan. The increasing presence of military troops in civilian areas has alarmed some civilians, worried their location puts them in the path of any future war between the US and China. “We don’t have to choose between the two,” said Manuel Mamba, governor of Cagayan province. “I do not like foreign forces in my province because I feel we could be dragged into a war which is not ours.” Mamba has vocally opposed the development of bases in his province for US troops and is among a small yet stubborn contingent of regional and local politicians who have resisted Manila’s turn towards Washington. Marcos Jr’s predecessor Rodrigo Duterte was  . Cagayan has received substantial investment from Chinese companies, including an ongoing effort to dredge and develop an international port in the coastal town of Aparri. The US military builds schools and distributes humanitarian aid during its yearly Balikatan exercises, but Washington has never competed dollar for dollar with the investment promises Beijing can make to local politicians. Last month, the US and the Philippines announced a new economic investment corridor in Luzon focused on ports, railways and clean energy. Such US investment would be welcome in Cagayan “if it is not military in nature”, Mamba said. “Maybe [it could be used] only by the Armed Forces of the Philippines if there’s an emergency.” In Laoag, where live-fire exercises were held, fishermen were ordered not to sail for more than one week. The order cost some fishing boats up to $60 per day in lost income, said Arvin Mangrubang, a priest at the Laoag branch of the Iglesia Filipino Independiente church. Some communities gave relief stipends of about $9 per day to families that are registered to vote, which Mangrubang said is hardly enough to cover the cost of the exercises to working families. “We cannot gain anything from that,” he said. “If China reacts to these exercises, the Filipino people will suffer.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/philippines-us-simulate-mock-invasions-in-largest-ever-war-games,Al Jazeera,"Philippines, US simulate mock invasions in largest ever war games",1
25,Politics,"On May 5, the breaking news that Hamas had accepted a ceasefire deal spread like wildfire across Gaza, sending people to the streets celebrating. Their joy was short-lived, however, as Israel pressed forward with a deadly ground assault on Rafah. After weeks of facing accusations from Israel and the US that its stance was impeding progress in ceasefire negotiations, Hamas made a strategic decision with which it effectively outmanoeuvred its enemy. The ball is now in Israel’s court and by extension, the court of its main backer, the United States. If a deal for a lasting ceasefire is not concluded, Israel will be exposed as the true spoiler of peace, and US as a dishonest broker. There are already indications that the two are playing a game, trying to sell to the global public unconvincing narratives that Israel was not aware of the deal that was proposed to Hamas and that the US opposes an Israeli operation of Rafah. Despite the appearance of public surprise and puzzlement by both, it may well be that they knew and expected what would happen next. Israel has claimed that it is rejecting the deal because it was not aware of new provisions included in it, and yet there are reports that CIA chief Bill Burns who is involved in the negotiations has been briefing the Israeli side. And given President Joe Biden’s “ironclad” support for Israel, it seems highly unlikely his administration would negotiate a deal that does not favour its ally’s interests. The US, for its part, has claimed that it staunchly opposes an Israeli ground offensive on Gaza. And yet, the operation has started and the response from the Biden administration has been to  , not to denounce it. US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby   supposedly this was not the full invasion everyone expected, but a “limited” operation, thus indirectly indicating that the US was aware of Israeli plans. In this context, it is important to remember another “limited” operation that the US reportedly opposed, and which turned out to be not so “limited”. At the start of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, then-Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin claimed the Israeli army would enter only 40km (25 miles) into Lebanese territory, to “eliminate” positions of Palestinian armed groups that had bombarded northern Israel. Unsurprisingly, the Israeli troops did not stop at 40km and advanced all 110km (68 miles) to the capital Beirut and captured it. Trying to cover up its deceit, the Israeli government claimed the full-scale invasion was necessary due to the “situation on the ground” – a weak justification that even then-Secretary of State Alexander Haig repeated. The Israelis did not withdraw from Lebanon until 2000. Throughout this Israeli war on Gaza, there hasn’t been a warning publicly made by the US that Israel has heeded. It is indeed unclear to what extent such warnings are just optics of putting pressure on the Israeli government while continuing to support its every move. In this sense, one should take with a grain of salt reports that the Biden administration is holding off   of weapons to Israel to pressure it into halting the full-scale invasion of Rafah. Within the context of this supposedly “limited” operation, it is worrying the US is giving tacit approval for Israeli forces occupying the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The Israeli takeover of the Palestinian crossing point not only caused panic in Gaza, where people are terrified of badly needed aid being completely blocked, but also deeply worried Cairo, which condemned the attack. Egypt has repeatedly warned in the past that any presence of Israeli military troops on the Palestinian side of the   Corridor is a violation of the Camp David Accords and Philadelphi protocol, according to which this area has to be demilitarised. The Camp David Peace treaty between Israel and Egypt was brokered and guaranteed by the US in 1979. It was later amended with the Philadelphi protocol in 2005 after Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip. Egypt has abided by the provisions of the deal, but now Israel appears not to be. The Biden administration may be thinking it is successfully deflecting criticism by presenting the Israeli invasion of Rafah as “limited”, but the occupation of the crossing in violation of a US-backed treaty sends a clear message that the US and Israel have no qualms about walking all over agreements they have signed. This comes on top of Washington going out of its way to shield Israel from legal consequences for the atrocities it is committing in Gaza, thus undermining international law. US officials have called UN Security Council resolutions “not binding”, condemned the International Court of Justice for recognising the situation in Gaza as a “plausible” genocide, and threatened the International Criminal Court with sanctions if it issues arrest warrants for Israeli officials. As things stand now, Biden is headed towards losing the November election and leaving a dreadful legacy behind: overseeing a genocide in Gaza and undermining the international legal order to pave the way for more atrocities and more impunity. It is still not too late to change course. Biden must apply real, decisive pressure on Israel to accept a permanent ceasefire deal with Hamas, fully withdraw from Gaza, lift the siege and allow for full humanitarian access and reconstruction to begin.",https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/5/8/the-us-and-israel-are-playing-a-dangerous-game,Al Jazeera,The US and Israel are playing a dangerous game,1
26,Politics,"Donald Trump’s defence team has finished its cross-examination of adult film star Stormy Daniels, the most high-profile witness to testify so far in the former United States president’s New York criminal trial. Daniels’s   with Trump in 2006 riveted jurors this week and served as a reminder of the more lurid aspects of the trial, which takes place as Trump, a real estate developer-turned-politician, campaigns for reelection. On Thursday, Trump lawyer Susan Necheles grilled Daniels on the transaction at the centre of Trump’s hush money trial. Necheles pressed Daniels on why she accepted a $130,000 payment to keep quiet about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump instead of going public. “Why didn’t you do that?” Necheles asked, questioning why Daniels didn’t hold a news conference in 2016, as she had initially planned, to tell reporters about her alleged encounter with Trump. “Because we were running out of time,” Daniels said. 		 		 Necheles asked if she meant that she was running out of time to use the claim to make money. “To get the story out,” Daniels countered. Trump has denied any sexual relations with Daniels. But the alleged deal to buy her silence happened in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign, a critical point in the case because   that Trump and his allies buried potentially damaging stories to influence the election results. The former president   of falsifying business records pertaining to the alleged hush-money payment made to silence Daniels. Trump, the presumptive Republican Party presidential nominee in November’s election, denies any wrongdoing. Daniels’s testimony marked an extraordinary moment in what could be the only criminal case against Trump to go to trial before voters decide whether to send him back to the White House. He faces  , including two that relate to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, which he lost to President Joe Biden. The trial date in one of those cases — over Trump’s handling of classified documents — was postponed indefinitely earlier this week. In the New York hush money case, Daniels testified on Thursday that, as she negotiated a nondisclosure agreement with Trump’s  , she was also talking with journalists as a “backup” plan. Necheles accused her of refusing to share the story with reporters because she wouldn’t be paid for it. “The better alternative was for you to get money, right?” Necheles said. Daniels said she was most interested in getting her story out and ensuring her family’s safety. “The better alternative was to get my story protected with a paper trail so that my family didn’t get hurt,” Daniels replied. Later, Daniels said in court that she never spoke with Trump about   she received from Cohen and had no knowledge of whether Trump was aware of or involved in the transaction. Necheles, Trump’s lawyer, also asked Daniels if she was aware of what Trump had been indicted for, producing an uncomfortable answer that the defence wanted stricken from the record: “There’s a lot of indictments.” Daniels went on to say that she knew the charges involved business records, but when asked if she knew anything about Trump’s business records, she acknowledged: “I know nothing about his business records. No. Why would I?” Rebecca Manochio, a junior bookkeeper at the Trump Organization when Trump was president, and Madeleine Westerhout — his personal secretary from 2017 to 2019 and the former director of Oval Office Operations from February to August 2019 — also took the stand on Thursday. Manochio testified about how cheques were sent to the White House for Trump to sign from his personal account, and Westerhout provided the White House’s perspective on that arrangement. Westerhout said Trump would receive packages about twice a month — some containing one check and others with a stack about a half-inch thick. The checks were often attached to invoices stating what the payment was for. 		 		 Before the lunch break on Thursday, another Trump lawyer, Todd Blanche, announced the defence would renew its motion for a mistrial, on the basis that Daniels’s testimony would prejudice the jury against their client. After the witnesses and jury were dismissed for the day, the defence team proceeded to do just that, pressing Judge Juan Merchan to void the trial. Earlier in the week, on Tuesday, Trump’s lawyers also sought a mistrial, saying that Daniels had “inflamed” the jury with unnecessary details about her alleged sexual encounter with the ex-president. On Thursday, they once again put forth their argument that Daniels’s experiences had nothing to do with a case that was primarily about business records. But Merchan dismissed their motion a second time, saying it was the defence’s responsibility to issue objections during any testimony they felt was inappropriate. “There were many times — not once or twice, but many times — when Ms Necheles could’ve objected but didn’t,” Merchan said of Trump’s defence team. He also underscored that some details were important for establishing Daniels’s credibility. “The more specificity Ms Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh about whether the encounter did occur and if so, whether they choose to credit Ms Daniels’s story,” he said. The defence also sought to challenge Judge Merchan’s gag order on Trump as it relates to the adult film star. They argued that, if Daniels could speak about Trump from the witness stand, he should be able to speak about her. But Merchan brushed aside the defence’s request, indicating it could intimidate future witnesses. “My concern is not just with protecting Ms Daniels or a witness who has already testified. My concern is with protecting the integrity of these proceedings as a whole,” Merchan said. The judge had previously imposed a gag order prohibiting Trump from publicly attacking witnesses, jury members and other figures related to the trial. The former president has   and held in contempt of court 10 times for violating the order. Speaking to reporters on his way into court on Thursday, Trump called the trial a “Frankenstein case” and questioned its merits. “It’s not a recognisable crime that any of us have seen,” he said of the charges against him. “This is a prosecutor making it up as he goes along.” As he left, Trump renewed his criticism of the case, specifically attacking Judge Merchan for failing to declare a mistrial. “This judge, what he did and what his ruling was — is — a disgrace,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/trumps-lawyer-presses-stormy-daniels-on-day-14-of-hush-money-trial,Al Jazeera,Trump’s lawyer presses Stormy Daniels on day 14 of hush money trial,1
27,Politics,"Jalen Brunson shrugged off injury to spark a sensational second-half fightback as the New York Knicks battled past the Indiana Pacers 130-121 to take a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Wednesday. New York talisman Brunson gave his team a huge scare after suffering a foot injury in the first quarter which forced him to sit out the remainder of the half at Madison Square Garden. Indiana exploited Brunson’s absence to open up a 10-point advantage by half-time and were soon 12 points up in the third quarter after an early Andrew Nembhard layup. But a limping Brunson – who returned at the start of the third quarter – led a stunning rally as the Knicks outscored Indiana 36-18 in the third to take a 99-91 lead into the fourth quarter. The Knicks then dug deep to hold onto their advantage in the fourth, outscoring the Pacers 31-30 to close out a famous victory. Brunson finished with 29 points and five assists while Donte DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby came up big with 28 points apiece. Josh Hart added 19 points with 15 rebounds while Isaiah Hartenstein was huge defensively, with 12 rebounds, eight assists and 14 points. Jalen Brunson lights it up in Game 2, scoring 24 of his 29 PTS in the 2nd half propelling the   to the 2-0 series lead! Game 3 is Friday at 7pm/et on ESPN. OG Anunoby: 28 PTS (playoff career high), 4 3PM Josh Hart: 19 PTS, 15 REB, 7 AST Donte DiVincenzo: 28 PTS & 6 3PM…  — NBA (@NBA)  “We found a way, that’s it,” said an exhausted Brunson. “For us it starts with our habits — we’ve talked about doing the little things from day one a little bit better, because you never know when they’re going to help you in a big game. “It’s all about doing the little things well every single day, and we pride ourselves on that.” The victory came at a cost though for the Knicks, who were already missing injured first-choice players Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic. As well as the injury to Brunson on Wednesday, the Knicks saw another player injured with Anunoby limping out of the game in the third quarter with a hamstring problem. Somehow the Knicks hung on to edge past the Pacers, with Brunson pouring in 14 fourth-quarter points and DiVincenzo adding eight points including two crucial three-pointers that helped keep Indiana at arm’s length. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau revealed the team were uncertain of whether Brunson would continue after missing the second quarter. “We didn’t know if he was going to be able to go or not, but he found a way to get it done,” Thibodeau said. Tyrese Haliburton led Indiana’s scorers with 34 points while Nembhard finished with 15 points and Pascal Siakam 14. Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle was ejected late in the fourth quarter after ranting at officials following a decision to overturn a double-dribble call against the Knicks’ Hartenstein. Carlisle took aim at the officiating crew following the defeat, saying his team had been unfairly treated. “I’m always talking to our guys about not making it all about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot,” Carlisle said. “There’s not a consistent balance and that’s disappointing. Give New York credit for the physicality that they’re playing with. But their physicality is rewarded and ours is penalized.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/5/9/nba-playoffs-brunson-guides-ny-knicks-win-over-indiana-pacers,Al Jazeera,Brunson shines as NY Knicks fight back to beat Indiana Pacers in Game 2,1
28,Politics,"Student protests against the Israeli war on Gaza have rocked the United States over the past few weeks, prompting a   on many campuses and more than 2,000 arrests. Students who have set up protest encampments at universities across the country are calling for their institutions to withdraw all investments from firms complicit in Israeli abuses against Palestinians. While the focus has been on Columbia University in New York and other elite Ivy League institutions, students are also   in the US South. Smaller Southern cities were at the heart of the 1960s civil rights movement, but today, like then, protesters operate in a particularly hostile, even violent environment. In New Orleans, the largest city in Louisiana, protests have taken place on university campuses and on the city’s streets. On April 28 for a few hours, the campus encampment movement spilled into the city centre. A few dozen protesters set up green tents in Jackson Square, demanding the city, too, divest from Israel. This was the first time the encampment movement had spread beyond universities in New Orleans. It signalled a desire on the part of protesters to amplify their message – even before Israel seized control of the   and intensified its bombing on Monday in preparation for a potentially imminent ground assault on an already devastated area where more than 1.4 million Palestinians, including 600,000 children, are sheltering. “It’s overdue,” said Kinsey, a supporter of the off-campus encampment who gave only their first name. “It’s been bubbling [up]. The tides were already shifting. That pressure has been building. We’ve used our words. We’ve chanted and marched and been ignored. So now, solidarity encampments are the bare minimum.” 		 		 The Jackson Square encampment, which was not claimed by any one organisation, was occupied by a mix of about 40 local artists, builders and service industry workers. Sprawled on the grass, the protesters made demands that echoed that of the student movement: They called for the city to divest from Israeli companies and institutions deemed to be profiting from the war on Gaza. The Port of New Orleans was one institution singled out after it entered into a partnership with Israel’s Port of Ashdod last year. The protesters sat on the ground at the heart of the city’s French Quarter during one of the city’s busiest tourist weekends when it was hosting its annual Jazz and Heritage Festival. The goal, one protester said, was not necessarily to stay indefinitely – he just hoped police would allow them to stay overnight. Passing tourists snapped photos. Protesters played music and shared food. About a dozen police officers stood nearby, seemingly unsure about how to force them to dismantle. But as night fell a few hours later, things changed. Police announced the park was closed and ordered protesters to leave. When they refused, officers began to grab and then tackle protesters, chasing and arresting 12 people. Three protesters were taken to hospital, two with broken bones. Police used Tasers on several people, at least one of whom was handcuffed on the ground at the time. One of those arrested appeared in court the next day in a wheelchair due to injuries allegedly inflicted by police and told Al Jazeera that officers broke his leg with a baton. Another suffered a skull fracture, according to a press release issued by some of the protesters. The charges levelled against those arrested are more severe than what students have typically faced. Two protesters are being charged with a “hate crime against law enforcement”, a charge created in Louisiana in 2016, the equivalent of which exists in just a handful of US states. Undeterred, a campus encampment sprang up the next day. Students were already planning the encampment at Tulane University, a private university miles across town, before they heard about the off-campus protest in the city centre, they said. Taking responsibility for protests in Louisiana exposes organisers to great legal risks. A recent court decision means protest organisers can be held liable for the actions of participants. It is also, according to a decades-old state law, illegal to wear masks in public. A pair of bills working their way through the Louisiana State Legislature, 70 percent of whose seats are held by conservative Republicans, would give motorists the right to run over protesters blocking roads if drivers feel they are in danger. Another would make it a crime to be within 25ft (7.6 metres) of a working officer. Antiwar organisers at Tulane have faced an uphill battle from the start, students said. “Tulane is one of the most deeply connected institutions to …Israel,” said Kristin Hamilton, a Tulane graduate student. The school leads one of four US-Israel Energy Centers, collaborating with Israeli universities and an Israeli fossil fuel company to research and develop gas extraction. When students gathered to set up tents on their campus on April 29, police officers, some on horseback, immediately began tearing them down, the students said. Brenna Byrne, a former student at Tulane, said she saw a police horse’s hooves nearly come down on the head of one student who had been detained on the ground. Afraid the student would be killed, she moved forward to help and saw her own sister, Hannah, also on the ground and being arrested, a police officer kneeling on her head. She and five others were arrested. But suddenly, the police backed off. Dozens, then hundreds of young people came to the encampment, located between a main thoroughfare and the university president’s office. Students played music, made signs, sang and chanted, “Hold the line for Palestine.” The camp had snacks, a literature table and a 10ft (3-metre) watermelon puppet in a dress – the watermelon having become a widely used symbol for the Palestinian flag. Members of the public came out to drop off supplies. By the next day, a billboard-sized LED sign had been erected, blasting loud music and displaying a message that warned protesters they were trespassing. Demonstrators as well as a Tulane facilities worker and police present at the site said they believed it was set up by university authorities. The music drowned out attempts by groups of Jewish and Muslim protesters to perform prayers throughout the afternoon. Despite the threat of dispersal, the mood was upbeat. Silas Gillett, a Jewish sophomore, said: “Multiple people came up to us and said they felt more safe that day than they ever had on campus. Tulane is, usually, a very hostile place for Palestinians, Muslims and students of colour.” Hamilton recalled people dancing dabke, a traditional Palestinian folk dance, that night, even as police gathered nearby. “To see that Palestinian joy happening at the exact same time the state was trying to oppress and terrorise us – that was really powerful.” The camp lasted 33 hours. On May 1 at 3am, more than 100 state troopers in riot gear and backed by armoured vehicles stormed the encampment and arrested 14 students. “It was overwhelming,” Hamilton recalled. Video footage reviewed by Al Jazeera shows state police pushing Hamilton to the ground, and the student shared medical records showing they were later diagnosed with a concussion as a result of assault. The student believes they were targeted because they were filming the police at the time. In another video reviewed, an officer pulls a weapon believed to be a bean-bag rifle and aims it point-blank at nearby students. Students described the police response as “traumatic”. The police reaction to the Tulane encampment appeared far more organised than the response to the Jackson Square protest: More than 100 state troopers in riot gear moved in one coordinated skirmish line to dismantle the Tulane camp as opposed to the Jackson Square arrests, which were initiated by about a dozen local officers A lawyer who was acting as a liaison between the Tulane protesters and police said law enforcement “could have de-escalated, but they chose riot gear”. The liaison, who asked not to be identified to prevent retaliation, has acted as a legal observer at dozens of protests over various issues in Louisiana but said, “Everything about this one was different.” The aggression displayed by “the police was like nothing I’ve seen at any protests before”, the liaison added. “It was a militarisation.” But the reaction towards the demonstrations does not necessarily mean that protesters will not take to the streets in New Orleans again. Protesters said that while Tulane is hostile towards Palestinians, pro-Palestinian sentiment is still strong in the city. Gillett attributed it in part to New Orleans’s predominantly Black and lower-income population. There is also a significant Palestinian population in the area involved in protesting, and this year, a Palestinian New Orleanian, Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, 17, was killed when he was shot in the head by the Israeli army near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Eman Abdelhadi, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, said that in the US, “brown and Black communities and poorer folks are more supportive of Palestine. And I think the reason is that Palestine is an anti-colonial movement.” Polling has consistently found Black Americans to be more sympathetic to the Palestinian cause than white Americans. “I think we’re seeing that the Palestine movement [is] strongest in places where there’s also a broader, multiracial working class.” “This is absolutely a class issue,” Hannah Byrne said. That also means that when authorities turn their power on the protesters, students from racial minorities and lower-income backgrounds often suffer the most. On April 30, for example, Gillet was notified that he had been suspended from Tulane along with seven other students and evicted from his student housing due to his involvement in the encampment, pending a hearing. He said most of the students he had organised the protests with were on needs-based scholarships. He also has a scholarship, and his suspension may force him to leave school. The actions of the police and university administration can be viewed as part of a wider climate at Tulane and in Louisiana that has viewed pro-Palestinian sentiment with suspicion and even as a threat. The State Legislature on Wednesday advanced a bill that doubles down on backing for Israel, calling for support for “the nation of Israel in the wake of the October 7, 2023, terror attacks and Israel’s ongoing efforts to root out Hamas”. Even before the nationwide wave of pro-Palestinian protests, demonstrators were arrested at a Tulane rally in October, and in March, Tulane Professor and former CNN CEO Walter Isaacson was filmed pushing a protesting student. The majority of Americans under 30 want a   in Gaza, according to polling data. As Israel presses on with “ironclad” support from the US, what will the Gaza protest movement come to look like? “I don’t think the protest is starting in university campuses and spilling over,” Abdelhadi said. “I would say the direction has flowed the opposite way,” from the public onto campuses. Abdelhadi pointed to past civil rights movements where she said there “wasn’t one specific action that changed everything”. Instead, in her view, it was “a combination of all the actions, all the tactics”. Until Israel’s war in Gaza ends, the anger among pro-Palestinian protesters and their desire for change are unlikely to go away. “Although we have been suspended, that does not mean we will be giving up,” said Maya Sanchez, another Tulane student involved in the encampment. “As Israel and its violence escalates, so does our commitment to fight for a liberated Palestine.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/8/in-the-us-south-pro-palestinians-face-crackdown-on-campus-and-in-streets-2,Al Jazeera,"In the US South, pro-Palestinians face crackdown on campus and in streets",1
29,Politics,"On Wednesday, May 8, United States Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin became the first senior administration official to   that the US government has uncharacteristically paused a weapons shipment to Israel. Over the past seven months, the Israeli military has killed some 35,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip with solid US backing. Speaking at a Senate subcommittee hearing, Secretary Austin remarked that the pause takes place “in the context of unfolding events in Rafah”, the city in southern Gaza where an  , including more than 600,000 children, are currently sheltering. The majority of these people were forced to flee to Rafah from other parts of Gaza, in keeping with Israel’s modus operandi of making Palestinians refugees over and over again. And while Rafah has   the terror and slaughter that have characterised the past seven months of Israeli operations in the coastal enclave as a whole, the threat of a   on a mass of trapped civilians in the city has made even the global superpower – Israel’s devoted BFF – a bit squeamish. To that end, news reports began emerging over the weekend that the Joe Biden administration had undertaken to suspend a shipment to Israel of munitions that might be used in a Rafah offensive. The shipment was   of 3,500 bombs, of which 1,800 were of the 2,000-pound (907kg) variety and 1,700 were in the 500-pound (227kg) category. Certain other weapons transfers to Israel were also said to be under review. Of course, given that the US has been actively abetting genocide and   in Gaza for well over half a year with all manner of munitions and money, it’s not exactly clear why the case of Rafah should suddenly elicit such imperial concern. But, hey, it’s potentially good PR. Prior to Secretary Austin’s remarks on Wednesday, US officials had been noncommittal about the reports of a suspended weapons shipment. In a May 6  , for example, National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby flat-out refused to confirm whether or not the reports were correct, instead announcing: “All I can tell you is that … our support for Israel’s security remains ironclad. And I’m not going to get into the specifics of – of one shipment over another.” Indeed, it appears that “ironclad” is the US political establishment’s new favourite word when it comes to   support for Israel – which means that, at the end of the day, Israel’s habit of massacring Palestinians will always be defended over the right of Palestinians to not be massacred. Meanwhile, Kirby’s comment about “one shipment over another” is telling, to say the least. After all, there are a whole lot of US weapons shipments to Israel – and holding up delivery of 3,500 bombs hardly constitutes a betrayal of the Israeli killing machine, as some more dramatic members of the US right wing have chosen to portray it. For starters, Secretary Austin emphasised during his Senate subcommittee appearance that the paused weapons shipment will not affect the   in supplemental aid to Israel that the US Congress approved in April. This is on top of the various billions of dollars already provided annually to Israel by the US – most of which money, the Council on Foreign Relations  , “is provided as grants under the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, funds that Israel must use to purchase U.S. military equipment and services”. Nor will the suspension impact the additional $827m worth of military goodies that the Biden administration has just authorised for Israel. In other words, it is mostly business as usual – kind of the equivalent of giving somebody hundreds of dollars on a daily basis and then making a show of withholding five cents.  the US Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, the US government is obligated to “prevent … arms transfers that risk facilitating or otherwise contributing to violations of human rights or international humanitarian law”. And yet, what is US foreign policy itself if not one big violation of all of that? Even prior to the 2001 launch of the massive global violation known as the “War on Terror”, the US had already spent decades enabling mass bloodshed from Latin America to the Middle East and beyond. In the particular case of Israel, consistent US support for the wanton violation of human rights and international humanitarian law in Palestine and   makes you wonder why anyone ever bothered writing up a Conventional Arms Transfer Policy in the first place. Now Secretary Austin, too, has reaffirmed the United States’ “ironclad” commitment to Israel even in the face of the paused munitions shipment – which just goes to underscore the largely cosmetic nature of the move, and the perceived need to project some degree of humanitarian awareness and concern. Biden himself also chimed in on Wednesday with a warning that he will not be supplying offensive weapons to Israel in the event of an all-out assault on Rafah, noting that “civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs”. Well, yeah. Genocide is genocide. And give or take a few thousand bombs, US complicity in that genocide is totally ironclad.",https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/5/9/give-or-take-a-few-bombs-us-complicity-in-genocide-remains-ironclad,Al Jazeera,"Give or take a few bombs, US complicity in genocide remains ‘ironclad’",1
30,Politics,"The United States has halted the shipment of some types of heavy bombs to Israel and US President Joe Biden has also pledged to halt the supply of some offensive weapons and artillery shells to the country if it goes ahead with its assault on Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah. Here’s what we know so far. Biden issued this warning, possibly his starkest yet against Israel, during an interview with CNN on Wednesday. In the same interview, he also said that the US would continue to supply defensive arms such as   interceptors, underlining his continued support for Israel’s defence. US officials said on Wednesday that the US had paused a shipment of heavy bombs, including 1,800 of 2,000-pound (907kg) bombs and 1,700 of 500-pound (227kg) bombs. The Washington-based news outlet, Politico, reported that the weapons held back also include Boeing’s Joint Direct Attack Munitions, which are guidance kits that convert “dumb” bombs dropped in free-fall, ballistic trajectory into precision-guided, “smart bombs”. Zoran Kusovac, a military analyst, explained: “The dumb bomb – basically you drop it from the plane and it falls much in the same way as it did in World War One and World War Two and Vietnam. “Smart bombs have additional elements: they have a smart nose that seeks the target. And It identifies it and they have the smart back that basically, guides the bomb to the target or gives it additional power to fly longer distances.” These weapons had been included in an earlier shipment for Israel, approved before the recent   authorised by the US Congress in April, which assigned $26.38bn for Israel, including $9.1bn for humanitarian purposes. At a US Senate hearing on Wednesday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the US is reviewing near-term security assistance to Israel in the context of Israel’s ongoing attacks on Rafah. “We’ve been very clear…from the very beginning that Israel shouldn’t launch a major attack into Rafah without accounting for and protecting the civilians that are in that battle space,” Austin said. On explosion, a 500-pound bomb can severely harm or kill everything or anyone within a   (65 feet) radius. A 2,000-pound bomb has a destruction radius of 35 metres (115 feet), according to the Project on Defense Alternatives (PDA), which conducts defence policy research and analysis. Depending on the type of surfaces it hits, a 500-pound bomb can create a crater of, on average, 25 feet (7.6 metres) across and 8.5 feet (2.6 metres) deep. A 2000-pound bomb will carve out a crater 50 feet (15 metres) across and 16 feet (5 metres), according to the  . A 2015 report by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) says of the 2000-pound bomb: “The pressure from the explosion can rupture lungs, burst sinus cavities and tear off limbs hundreds of metres from the blast site.” Israeli forces used 2,000-pound bombs on the Jabalia refugee camp on October 31, according to analysis by The Guardian and The New York Times. Two impact craters estimated to be 40 feet (12 metres) wide were identified. Aerial bombing in densely populated areas is not explicitly illegal in international humanitarian law. However, civilians cannot be targets of the bombing and any civilian casualties must be “proportionate” with a specific military aim. Both the Additional Protocol I of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Hague Convention of 1907 lay down these rules. Israel is a signatory to both. If the numbers of civilian casualties are not proportionate and are “clearly excessive” as measured against any direct military advantage, then the attack qualifies as a war crime according to the statute of the International Criminal Court, which is investigating Israel’s war on Gaza. Israel asserts that its only interest is in destroying Hamas and that it does not target Palestinian civilians. It claims to take all precautions to avoid unnecessary casualties. It has justified its assault on Rafah with the claim that the city is home to Hamas’s remaining battalions. More than one million civilians have taken shelter there from the Israeli bombardment on other parts of the Gaza Strip over the past seven months, however. On Thursday, Gilad Erdan, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations told Israeli public radio Kan: “This is a difficult and very disappointing statement to hear from a president to whom we have been grateful since the beginning of the war.” Erdan said Biden’s warning would bolster the positions of Iran, Hamas and  . “If Israel is restricted from entering an area as important and central as Rafah where there are thousands of terrorists, hostages and leaders of Hamas, how exactly are we supposed to achieve our goals?” he said. The US sends Israel about $3bn a year, most of which is provided as Foreign Military Financing (FMF). The US has historically supplied substantial foreign aid to Israel; a total of $297bn (adjusted for inflation) between 1946 and 2023, $216bn of which was in military aid and $81bn in economic aid, according to data from the US Agency for International Aid (USAID). Israel is the   of US aid since its founding. After the Hamas attack on October 7, the   navy ships such as guided missile cruisers armed with naval guns and destroyers alongside $2bn worth of munitions to Israel. Israel is reliant on US military aid because of a global ammunition shortage following the wars in Gaza and  , Israeli daily business newspaper, the Calcalist reported, adding that while the Israeli military has avoided conceding this in public, Major General Eliezer Toledano admitted in March that the army is reducing air attacks in order “to better manage the economy of armaments”. Military analyst Zoran Kusovac said: “Israel has been expending its bombs from the very beginning at a very very high rate. Analysts always believe that Israel cannot sustain the initial rate of bombing and at a certain point that actually happens.” Yes. The US paused military aid to Israel in 1982, when then-President Ronald Reagan imposed a six-year ban on cluster weapons sales to Israel. This followed a congressional investigation which revealed that Israel had used the weapons on areas with civilian populations when it invaded Lebanon in 1982. Israel launched a military offensive on Rafah and   of the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, cutting off access to humanitarian relief, on Tuesday, hours after   to a ceasefire deal. This followed an overnight assault on the area using warplanes which killed at least 12 civilians. After Israel’s relentless bombardment of the Gaza Strip since the start of the war on  , more than one million internally displaced Palestinians have taken shelter in Rafah – many of them previously displaced from other parts of Gaza following Israel’s orders to evacuate from those areas.

31,Politics,"United States President Joe Biden has faced   to stop sending weapons to Israel as the US ally wages war in the Gaza Strip. Rights advocates, lawmakers and protesters across the US have demanded an end to the transfers, warning the president that the arms were being used in human rights violations and war crimes in Gaza. This week, senior   that Washington had paused one shipment of “high payload munitions” to Israel over concerns about the Israeli military’s planned offensive in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Biden himself appeared to go a step further on Wednesday evening, telling CNN that he would not be “supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah” if Israeli forces go into “population centres”. But what exactly did Biden say, what do his remarks mean in practice and what do experts say should come next? 		 		 CNN’s Erin Burnett asked Biden in   about his administration’s decision to pause the single weapons shipment to Israel, which contained 1,800 bombs, each weighing about 900kg (2,000lb), and another 1,700 bombs weighing 226kg (500lb) each. “Have those bombs, those  , been used to kill civilians in Gaza?” Burnett asked. Biden replied: “Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they [the Israeli forces] go after population centres.” “And I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone into Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, that deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.” The US president added that his administration would “continue to make sure Israel is secure in terms of [its] Iron Dome”   as well as in its ability to “respond to attacks”. “But it’s just wrong. We’re not going to supply the weapons and the artillery shells,” he said. Burnett then asked Biden whether Israeli forces, which this week seized the Gaza side of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and launched deadly attacks on the city, had not already “gone into Rafah”. “They haven’t gone into the population centres. What they did is right on the border,” Biden said. “I’ve made it clear to ‘Bibi’ [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] and the war cabinet: They’re not going to get our support if in fact they go into these population centres.” The Rafah border crossing is, however, contiguous with the town of Rafah, and Palestinians point out that even before Israel seized the area, it had been hitting Rafah with air attacks throughout the war, killing numerous civilians, including children. 		 		 Brian Finucane, a senior adviser in the US programme at the International Crisis Group, said Biden was not explicit about the types of weapons that would fall into what he described as those “used historically to deal with Rafah”. The US president’s remarks also were not “a model of clarity as to what the trigger would be for such a termination, given the fact that  “, Finucane told Al Jazeera. He added that “even if there were an immediate cut-off of air-delivered munitions or artillery shells” to the Israeli military, “that may not have an immediate operational impact based on the stores they may have on hand.” Still, Finucane said, “This is another step … and it’s an overdue step, but I think it remains to be seen how the Biden administration will carry through on this.” Patrick Bury, a professor at the University of Bath specialising in warfare, said a wide-scale military operation in Rafah would lead Israel to burn through its munitions very quickly, however. As a result, a potential US weapons cut-off “is going to be a major consideration” for Israel, Bury told Al Jazeera in a television interview. Speaking on Thursday, Netanyahu responded to Biden, saying Israel would “stand alone” if it had to. “I have said that if necessary, we will fight with our fingernails,” the prime minister said in a video address. “But we have much more than fingernails, and with that same strength of spirit, with God’s help, together we will win.” 		 		 Raed Jarrar, advocacy director at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), a think tank in Washington, DC, said Biden’s announcement in practice is “very limited, very qualified [and] very conditional”. Biden’s reasoning also is flawed, Jarrar told Al Jazeera, in that it is tied to a disagreement between the US and Israeli governments over Israel’s military tactics and   on Rafah. However, Jarrar said the US president’s remarks are a signal that Washington’s “  seems to be coming to an end”. They also are effectively an “admission that Israel is committing very serious crimes using US weapons – and that admission should lead to very serious consequences that are mandated under US law”, Jarrar said. 		 		 Finuncane said it is important “not to lose sight of the larger picture” during discussions on Israel’s military tactics in Rafah. “The US has substantial leverage to bring to bear to try to bring this conflict to an end,” he said, pointing to the weapons and other military assistance the American government provides to Israel. “It should be using that leverage after seven long months of conflict to bring about an end to the fighting, enable the hostage exchange, … enable aid to get into Gaza and hopefully   writ large.” The US sends Israel $3.8bn in military aid annually, and Congress   in additional support for the country. Jarrar also said the Biden administration needs to apply the country’s own laws, such as the Arms Export Control Act and the Foreign Assistance Act. The latter includes the so-called  , which prohibits assistance to foreign military units that commit abuses. The Biden administration’s own self-declared policy on conventional arms transfers also prohibits weapons transfers to countries “suspected of committing genocide or other broad violations of human rights, using US weapons”, Jarrar said. The International Court of Justice, the top United Nations court, said in January that there was a   and ordered Israel to prevent any genocidal acts from taking place in the enclave. “There is a lot” that the Biden administration can do, Jarrar added. “There are also moral and legal commitments [that] the administration is breaching with its continued aiding and abetting of Israel.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/5/9/what-did-biden-say-about-us-arms-transfers-to-israel-and-what-does-it-mean,Al Jazeera,What did Biden say about US arms transfers to Israel and what does it mean?,1
32,Politics,"US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has   that the United States paused a weapons shipment to Israel, as President Joe Biden’s administration faces growing pressure to condition aid to the top US ally amid the war in Gaza. Testifying before a US congressional subcommittee on Wednesday, Austin said the Biden administration  “one shipment of high payload munitions” amid concerns about the Israeli military’s push to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah. “We’ve been very clear … from the very beginning that Israel shouldn’t launch a major attack into Rafah without accounting for and protecting the civilians that are in that battlespace,” Austin told US lawmakers. “We’ve not made a final determination on how to proceed with that shipment [of weapons],” the Pentagon chief added, noting that the transfer is separate from a supplemental aid package for Israel that was  . “My final comment is that we are absolutely committed to continuing to support Israel in its right to defend itself.” President Biden himself spoke to the prospect of withholding weapons from Israel in an interview that aired on CNN later on Wednesday, denouncing the prospect of a major offensive in Rafah. “It’s just wrong,” he told CNN. “We’re not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells.” He clarified that the US would not be “walking away from Israel’s security”, but would rather be stepping away from supporting “Israel’s ability to wage war in those areas”. He cited the use of US weapons against civilians as a reason for the pause. “Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centres,” Biden said. 		 		   Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, responded to the shipment pause by saying the US decision was “very disappointing”. “[US President Joe Biden] can’t say he is our partner in the goal to destroy Hamas, while on the other hand delay the means meant to destroy Hamas,” Erdan said. Al Jazeera’s Kimberly Halkett, reporting from the White House on Wednesday, said the shipment included 1,800 bombs, each weighing about 900kg (2,000lbs), and another 1,700 bombs – each weighing 226kg (500lbs). “There has been, leading up to this delay, significant concerns on the part of not only   across the United States but also within the president’s own party … about how these weapons are being used,” Halkett said. US Senator Bernie Sanders welcomed the Biden administration’s pause on the weapons transfer, but said it “must be a first step”. “The US must now use all its leverage to demand an immediate ceasefire, the end of the attacks on Rafah, and the immediate delivery of massive amounts of humanitarian aid to people living in desperation,” Sanders said in a statement. “Our leverage is clear. Over the years, the United States has provided tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Israel.” The Biden administration has faced months of criticism over   amid the Gaza war, which has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians and plunged the enclave into a dire humanitarian crisis. But Washington has largely continued to provide military and diplomatic backing to Israel as the war grinds on. Israel stepped up its bombardment of Rafah on Monday, killing dozens of people after ordering about 100,000 residents in the city’s eastern areas to evacuate. Israeli troops also stormed the Palestinian side of the   between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, which serves as a major gateway for humanitarian aid. Yet despite continuing to say it has concerns for the fate of the more than 1.5 million Palestinians sheltering in Rafah, the US Department of State this week sought to play down the recent moves by the Israeli army. “This military operation that they launched last night was targeted just to [the] Rafah gate,” US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on Tuesday. “It wasn’t an operation in the civilian areas that they had ordered to be evacuated.” Commenting on the paused US weapons shipment to Israel during a news briefing on Wednesday afternoon, Miller stressed that Washington remains “committed to Israel’s security” despite its opposition to a Rafah operation. “We have paused one shipment of near-term assistance and we are reviewing others, but that said, our long-term commitment to Israel’s security has not changed,” he said. Still, human rights advocates have urged the US to do more to pressure the country to end its war on Gaza, and President Biden   — including on US college campuses — over his stance. A new poll released on Wednesday also suggested a growing disconnect between Biden and his Democratic Party base, which could pose a challenge as he   in November. The poll by Data for Progress, in collaboration with news website Zeteo,   that 56 percent of Democrats believed Israel was committing “genocide” in the besieged Palestinian territory. It also found that seven in 10 American voters — and 83 percent of Democrats — also support a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. 		 		 Hasan Pyarali, the Muslim Caucus chairman for College Democrats of America, the university arm of the Democratic Party,   that many young people have signalled they will not vote for Biden in the upcoming election. “It’s not just good policy to oppose the genocide; it’s good politics,” he said. The United Nations defines genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”, including killings and measures to prevent births. In January, the International Court of Justice — the UN’s top court — acknowledged there was a plausible risk of genocide in Gaza and ordered Israel to take “all measures within its power” to prevent genocidal acts against Palestinians.

36,Sports,"Malaysia’s Football Association has recommended players consider hiring bodyguards while top club Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT) has beefed up security for its squad after their midfielder Safiq Rahim became the third footballer to be attacked in the country in the past week. Former Malaysia captain Safiq Rahim was threatened with a hammer and had his car windscreen smashed by two assailants late on Tuesday. Safiq was not injured in the attack late in southern Johor state following a training session with JohorDarul Ta’zim, the local league’s defending champion and one of Asia’s top clubs which is run by the crown prince of the Johor royal family. The 36-year-old midfielder posted a photo of his black Honda with its rear windscreen smashed on Instagram. “Didn’t expect to be attacked near the Johor Darul Ta’zim (JDT) training centre. We need to be vigilant,” he wrote in the post. He also shared a copy of the police report he made on Instagram where he said: “Two men on a motorcycle suddenly approached my car armed with a hammer and smashed my rear car windscreen.” “I stopped the car and I was in fear.” The incident comes within a week of two other attacks on footballers in the Southeast Asian nation. It has led Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) president Hamidin Mohamad Amin to urge high-profile footballers to take precautions about their personal safety, including hiring bodyguards. “If you are a big player, you can consider what the overseas footballers are doing, which is to get a bodyguard,” he was quoted as saying by The Star newspaper. Malaysia’s right winger Faisal Halim is in an intensive care unit with fourth-degree burns after being splashed with acid at the weekend outside the capital Kuala Lumpur. Police are investigating the motive for the attack. Nicknamed “Mickey”, the 26-year-old plays on the right wing for Selangor Football Club and Malaysia. Faisal suffered burns on the neck, shoulder, hands and chest in Petaling Jaya district over the weekend. “I am at the hospital. Faisal’s condition is a bit critical but stable,” Football Association of Selangor deputy president Shahril Mokhtar told AFP news agency. He said Faisal was initially diagnosed as having suffered second-degree burns, “but after he was moved to another hospital, a plastic surgeon classified the injuries as fourth-degree burns.” Shahril said Faisal would undergo another surgery, adding that his movement and speech had been affected. “We are shocked and disappointed that such an attack happened in Malaysia. My concern is also about the mental health of the other players since the new season begins on Friday,” he said. CEO of Selangor Football Club Johan Kamal Hamidon said security has been heightened for the players, officials and staff of the club but he did not elaborate. A photo that went viral online showed a visibly shocked and shirtless Faisal seated on a bench with burn marks on his upper body. The acid attack came three days after another national team player, Akhyar Rashid, was injured in a robbery outside his home in the eastern state of Terengganu. Kuala Terengganu police chief Azli Mohamad Noor said the incidents were unrelated.

Fans at the famous venue, which seats more than 45,000 people, were stunned on Monday when Nery floored the unbeaten “Monster” in the first round with a huge left. But Inoue got up and knocked his Mexican opponent down in the following round and sent him to the canvas again in the fifth before finishing him off with a right hook in the sixth. “It was a great feeling to knock him down, but how about that surprise in the first round?” the 31-year-old Inoue asked. “As a boxer, when that happens to you, it fires you up. It gave me a lot of energy.” It was the first boxing event to be held at the Tokyo Dome since 42-1 underdog James “Buster” Douglas knocked out unbeaten heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in February 1990 in one of the sport’s biggest upsets. “There was a lot of pressure on me as the main event in the first boxing at Tokyo Dome in 34 years, but it gave me strength,” Inoue said. Inoue took his record to 27-0 with 24 wins by knockout. It was his first fight since becoming the undisputed super bantamweight world champion in December. He is just the second man to become undisputed world champion at two different weights since the four-belt era began in 2004. American Terence Crawford was the first. Fans at the Tokyo Dome gave the 31-year-old a rapturous welcome as he entered the cavernous venue with all four world championship belts up for grabs. A huge upset looked like it could be on the cards when Nery sent the champion sprawling. But it seemed to energise Inoue, and he came flying out of his corner to send Nery down in the second round. Inoue continued to land ferocious blows, and he sent his opponent to the canvas again with a left hook in the fifth round. The referee stopped the fight after Inoue downed Nery for a third time in the sixth round.   Nery, a former two-division world champion, was fighting in Japan for the first time since he was stripped of his bantamweight world title in 2018 after failing to make weight for a bout there. He was subsequently banned from fighting in Japan, but the country’s Boxing Commission gave him the green light to compete against Inoue. Nery was booed when he was introduced to the Tokyo Dome crowd. The 29-year-old’s record fell to 35-2 with 27 KOs. Inoue was fighting at super bantamweight for only the third time after beating American Stephen Fulton and Marlon Tapales of the Philippines last year for a clean sweep of the titles. He moved up in weight class after becoming the first undisputed bantamweight world champion since Panama’s Enrique Pinder in 1972. Earlier, fighting on the undercard, Japan’s Yoshiki Takei beat Australian defending champion Jason Moloney by unanimous decision to win the WBO bantamweight world title. Takei started strongly before Moloney came back into the bout in his second title defence. But the Japanese fighter, a former kickboxer who had won all eight of his previous boxing matches by knockout, took the title in front of a raucous crowd .",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/5/6/inoue-vs-nery-japanese-champ-defends-super-bantamweight-titles-in-tokyo,Al Jazeera,Inoue stops Nery to remain undisputed super bantamweight champ,2

40,Sports,"Jalen Brunson shrugged off injury to spark a sensational second-half fightback as the New York Knicks battled past the Indiana Pacers 130-121 to take a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven NBA playoff series on Wednesday. New York talisman Brunson gave his team a huge scare after suffering a foot injury in the first quarter which forced him to sit out the remainder of the half at Madison Square Garden. Indiana exploited Brunson’s absence to open up a 10-point advantage by half-time and were soon 12 points up in the third quarter after an early Andrew Nembhard layup. But a limping Brunson – who returned at the start of the third quarter – led a stunning rally as the Knicks outscored Indiana 36-18 in the third to take a 99-91 lead into the fourth quarter. The Knicks then dug deep to hold onto their advantage in the fourth, outscoring the Pacers 31-30 to close out a famous victory. Brunson finished with 29 points and five assists while Donte DiVincenzo and OG Anunoby came up big with 28 points apiece. Josh Hart added 19 points with 15 rebounds while Isaiah Hartenstein was huge defensively, with 12 rebounds, eight assists and 14 points. Jalen Brunson lights it up in Game 2, scoring 24 of his 29 PTS in the 2nd half propelling the   to the 2-0 series lead! Game 3 is Friday at 7pm/et on ESPN. OG Anunoby: 28 PTS (playoff career high), 4 3PM Josh Hart: 19 PTS, 15 REB, 7 AST Donte DiVincenzo: 28 PTS & 6 3PM…  — NBA (@NBA)  “We found a way, that’s it,” said an exhausted Brunson. “For us it starts with our habits — we’ve talked about doing the little things from day one a little bit better, because you never know when they’re going to help you in a big game. “It’s all about doing the little things well every single day, and we pride ourselves on that.” The victory came at a cost though for the Knicks, who were already missing injured first-choice players Julius Randle, Mitchell Robinson and Bojan Bogdanovic. As well as the injury to Brunson on Wednesday, the Knicks saw another player injured with Anunoby limping out of the game in the third quarter with a hamstring problem. Somehow the Knicks hung on to edge past the Pacers, with Brunson pouring in 14 fourth-quarter points and DiVincenzo adding eight points including two crucial three-pointers that helped keep Indiana at arm’s length. Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau revealed the team were uncertain of whether Brunson would continue after missing the second quarter. “We didn’t know if he was going to be able to go or not, but he found a way to get it done,” Thibodeau said. Tyrese Haliburton led Indiana’s scorers with 34 points while Nembhard finished with 15 points and Pascal Siakam 14. Obi Toppin added 20 from the bench. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle was ejected late in the fourth quarter after ranting at officials following a decision to overturn a double-dribble call against the Knicks’ Hartenstein. Carlisle took aim at the officiating crew following the defeat, saying his team had been unfairly treated. “I’m always talking to our guys about not making it all about the officials, but we deserve a fair shot,” Carlisle said. “There’s not a consistent balance and that’s disappointing. Give New York credit for the physicality that they’re playing with. But their physicality is rewarded and ours is penalized.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/5/9/nba-playoffs-brunson-guides-ny-knicks-win-over-indiana-pacers,Al Jazeera,Brunson shines as NY Knicks fight back to beat Indiana Pacers in Game 2,2

42,Sports,"McLaren’s Lando Norris has won the first Formula One race of his career with a shock victory over world champion Max Verstappen in the Miami Grand Prix. Breathing life into an F1 season that risked becoming a one-man story again, Norris, in his 110th race for McLaren, beat Verstappen by more than seven seconds, with Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc finishing third. Verstappen, who began on pole, had won four of the opening five races of the season and leads the world championship standings. It looked like business as usual with the Dutchman, who had won the previous two Miami races, leading until lap 24 when he pitted and Norris’s McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri took the lead. Australian Piastri himself went into the pits four laps later, allowing Norris to grab the lead and the British driver never looked back. Crucially, Norris was able to pit during a safety car on lap 30, earning him a valuable time advantage which he never relinquished. The safety car came after Kevin Magnussen clipped Logan Sargeant, sending the American Williams driver into the wall and bringing a yellow flag. Norris, who had 15 podiums before his first win, took full advantage of the safety car and with Verstappen struggling to catch up, he secured his maiden victory. It was the first time Verstappen had been beaten on track when he finished the race since Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz won in Singapore in September last year. Your top ten in the 2024 Miami Grand Prix! 🌴     — Formula 1 (@F1)  Norris was hoisted in the air by the McLaren mechanics as his long wait for a victory in the sport came to an end. “About time huh?” said Norris, “I knew on Friday that we had the pace … today we managed to put it together. We had the perfect strategy. It all paid off,” he added. “I guess a lot of people doubted me along the way. I’ve made a lot of mistakes over the last five years, my short career, but today we pulled it all together, so this is all for the team. “I stuck with McLaren because I could believe in them and I did believe in them and today proved exactly that,” he added. Pulling into the pit lane Norris was mobbed by his team, congratulated by the other drivers and cheered by a massive crowd at the Miami International Autodrome. LANDO NORRIS IS A FORMULA 1 RACE WINNER! LANDO WINS THE  !!! 🧡  — McLaren (@McLarenF1)  The nearest Norris had come previously to winning a Grand Prix was in Sochi, Russia in 2021 when he led in the latter stages before failing to make a tyre change early in the rain, costing him dearly. Verstappen, who had complained about lack of grip in qualification and during Sunday’s race, said his Red Bull had been unable to keep up with Norris once the McLaren driver switched to hard tyres. “They just had more pace, Lando was flying. It was incredibly difficult for us, but on the bad days P2, I’ll take it right? “I’m very happy for Lando, it’s been a long time coming and it’s not going to be his last one. He definitely deserves it,” said the Dutchman. Very happy for  , congrats mate! 👏 For us it was not our strongest race, but I'll take P2 today.    — Max Verstappen (@Max33Verstappen)  Leclerc echoed those sentiments. “Very often he ran very close to it, but for one reason or another, he didn’t make it. But today he did an incredible job, and the whole weekend he has been on it,” said the Ferrari driver. As in the first two years of the Miami Grand Prix, held around Hard Rock Stadium, the home of the NFL’s Miami Dolphins, the race attracted plenty of celebrities. Former France international footballer and coach Zinedine Zidane, singer Ed Sheeran, Super Bowl-winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes and former US President Donald Trump were among those spotted at the race. Trump visited the McLaren garage before the race. Trump, who visited the McLaren garage prior to the race, was delighted to back a winner, telling Norris later he was his lucky charm. “He saw me after and he came to congratulate me,” said Norris, who had told his grandmother before coming to Miami that he was going to win a race. Norris’s parents were ecstatic, though they weren’t in Miami to witness the moment. “The cider’s flowing in Somerset! A big celebration,” Adam Norris told Sky Sports. “I was working out it’s probably about 900 races I’ve been to over the last 16 years. “It’s brilliant. So happy for him.” Anthony Hamilton, another father instrumental in the success of his son – seven times world champion Lewis – also texted Norris congratulations. Norris was still finalising plans on how he was going to celebrate his maiden victory, but he was already thinking about a second win. “This only happens once when you take your first win. Tonight is going to be a good night,” said Norris, confirming team boss Zak Brown had delayed the flight home until Monday so there would be a proper celebration. You never forget your first!

The 21-year-old’s participation at the Paris Olympics was cast in doubt after Mehrez Bousyan, head of the Tunisian Olympic Committee, told a locally televised sports programme that Hafnaoui will miss “a significant portion” of the Games, according to Africa Aquatics. However, the swimmer has refused to rule himself out completely. “I’m currently suffering from an injury, and I don’t know whether or not I will participate in the Olympics,” the 21-year-old Tunisian swimmer told AFP news agency on Wednesday. He did not give details of the injury. Boussayene said “nothing is confirmed”, adding the swimmer had a “developing injury” in his comments to AFP. “More than just medals, we seek above all the wellbeing of this young man who brought us so much joy,” said Boussayene. “He will have other world competitions.” Hafnaoui’s   sent a wave of wild celebrations through the North African nation. The then 18-year-old finished in three minutes, 43.26 seconds despite being the slowest qualifier to start the final. Hafnaoui went on to win the 800-metre and 1,500-metre freestyle titles at last year’s World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan. If he swims in Paris this year, he has a chance to match Tunisia’s top Olympic swimmer Oussama Mellouli, who won two golds and a bronze in the 2008 and 2012 Games.

46,Sports,"Luis Suarez scored a hat-trick and Lionel Messi had an incredible five assists and a goal in the second half as a rampant Inter Miami crushed the New York Red Bulls 6-2 in Major League Soccer. Two-goal substitute Matias Rojas sparked the second-half rout from Eastern Conference leaders Inter after New York had led 1-0 at the break. Without Messi, Miami had fallen to a 4-0 defeat to the Red Bulls in New York in March, but they more than avenged that loss with a merciless second-half demolition job on Saturday. Messi’s five assists, which all came in the second half, are a new record for an MLS game and he now has 10 goals and 12 assists in eight league appearances so far this season. Operating behind Suarez, Messi’s passing through the slightest of gaps, taking advantage of his former Barcelona teammate’s telepathic understanding of his intentions, was simply too much for the Red Bulls, who came into the game third in the East. “Obviously what we have seen today surprises people, because you don’t see that in football,” said Suarez of Messi’s five assists. “But as a teammate and someone who knows him, nothing surprises me about him,” added the Uruguayan. The 37-year-old Suarez’s triples take his own tally to 10 in 11 league games for Miami and despite no longer being blessed with pace, his deadly finishing clearly remains intact. While it was the kind of attacking display that Miami owners Jorge Mas and David Beckham surely dreamed of when they brought in the star pairing, there was no sign of the explosiveness in the opening half. Dante Vanzeir had put the Red Bulls ahead in the 30th minute, slotting home after Wikelman Carmona’s shot came out off the post, following a superb through pass from Swedish playmaker Emil Forsberg. Gerardo Martino’s Inter lacked intensity and ideas in the opening 45 minutes but the coach’s half-time change transformed the game. Paraguayan Rojas was introduced for the second half and took just three minutes to make an impact, collecting a pass from Messi and evading two defenders before unleashing an unstoppable drive from 25 yards out. Messi then put Miami in front when Rojas robbed Carmona and found Suarez, who slipped the ball to the Argentinian, who made no mistake. The eight-time Ballon d’Or winner then turned provider again as he split the New York defence with a brilliant through ball to Rojas, who deftly chipped over the advancing Carlos Coronel. Suarez’s hat-trick then came in the space of 12 minutes – he first found the target when Messi chipped in a ball from the right and the Uruguayan hooked home a volley. It was playground stuff minutes later when Suarez played a one-two with Messi and then poked home to make it 5-1. Messi was yet again the creator for Miami’s sixth, which Suarez turned in from close range from the tightest of angles. “The partnership of him [Messi] and Luis [Suarez] in the second half worked very well, like in old times … They were very influential in the game,” said Martino. New York had a late consolation in the final seconds with a penalty from Forsberg.",https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2024/5/5/messi-and-saurez-lead-inter-miamis-6-2-mls-win-over-new-york-red-bulls,Al Jazeera,‘Like old times’: Messi and Suarez shine in Inter Miami’s 6-2 win,2

79,Business,"A federal judge in Fort Worth, Texas, on Friday blocked a new Biden administration rule that would prohibit credit card companies from charging customers late fees higher than $8.
     
            US District Judge Mark T. Pittman, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, granted a preliminary injunction to several business and banking organizations that allege the new rule violates several federal statutes.
     
            These organizations, led by the right-leaning US Chamber of Commerce, sued the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau after the rule was finalized in March. The rule, which was set to go into effect Tuesday, would save consumers about $10 billion per year by cutting fees from an average of $32, the CFPB estimated.
     
            A preliminary injunction means the rule can’t go into effect until a hearing is held where the case can be adjudicated in greater detail.
     
            “The credit card lobby’s lawsuit is an attempt to derail a rule that will save families $10 billion each year in order to continue making tens of billions of dollars in profits by charging borrowers late fees that far exceed their actual costs,” a CFPB spokesperson told CNN in a statement. “Consumers will shoulder $800 million in late fees every month that the rule is delayed — money that pads the profit margins of the largest credit card issuers. We will continue to defend this rule so that working families can stop paying excessive late fees that Congress banned more than a decade ago.”
     
            The US Chamber of Commerce has not responded to CNN’s request for comment.
     
            “It is disappointing that the court has granted this last-ditch effort by the banks to prevent these critical limits on credit card late fees from going into effect next week,” said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director for non-profit Consumer Reports. “Credit card companies have been bilking consumers out of billions of dollars in excessive late fees for far too long.”
     
            The rule, first proposed in February 2023, is part of a broader push by the Biden administration to eliminate “junk fees,” considered hidden or misleading charges to consumers.
     
            The  new rule would apply to large credit card issuers  — those with more than 1 million accounts. These companies represent more than 95% of total outstanding credit card debt, according to the CFPB.
     
            The push to target credit card fees is part of the Biden administration’s efforts to ease financial burdens for many Americans. Some borrowers, especially millennials and those with lower incomes, have  fallen behind on their credit card debt  following more than two years of high inflation.
     
            The new rule also intended to close a 2010 loophole the CFPB says has been “exploited” by credit card companies to hike fees on late payments.
     
            According to a national Consumer Reports survey published in September, one in five American adults said they had paid a credit card late fee in the previous 12 months. Eighty-two percent said they supported lowering the maximum late fee.

80,Business,"Florida A&M University is putting a purported $237.75 million donation “on pause,” after media reports and college board leaders raised concerns about the actual value of the stock gift—and the details surrounding the donor’s previous donations.
     
            “A decision that was made yesterday to put a pause on this activity—a hold, is more or less, is the language that was used—pending some additional information that has come to my attention,” FAMU President Larry Robinson said Thursday during an emergency school board meeting, called after media reports and school leaders raised concerns about the legitimacy of the gift.
     
            It’s a stunning reversal from the fanfare last Saturday at FAMU’s commencement ceremony, when the announcement of the gift made headlines as one of the largest ever personal donations ever to a historically Black college or university.
     
            Gregory Gerami, the 30-year-old CEO of Texas hydroponic hemp farm company Batterson Farms Corp., presented the $237.75 million stock gift via an oversized, ceremonial check to university administration members including Robinson, who called the gift “breathtaking in its generosity and its scope” via a  press release  the day of the donation.
     
            But the jubilance quickly gave way to skepticism.
     
            A  report   from Politico noted Batterson Farms Corp. is a comparatively small company, and that its private shares are unlikely to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
     
            In 2020, a notable deal involving a donor later identified as Gerami fell apart. South Carolina’s Coastal Carolina University had announced a $95 million donation from an anonymous donor, who then backed out months later. An investigation by the  Myrtle Beach Sun News  identified Gerami in a story that noted, among other details, that he backed out alleging racism from CCU officials—an allegation they denied.
     
            At an emergency board meeting on Thursday, FAMU board of trustee and foundation members expressed their concerns and frustration about the school’s vetting process involving Gerami’s donation.
     
            Several members of the FAMU Foundation Board of Directors and Deveron Gibbons, the vice chair of the university’s Board of Trustees, said they were not informed of the donation until it was announced at commencement.
     
            “This meeting is taking place because no one, as I am aware of from this conversation, had any clue this was going on,” Gibbons told CNN. “We are talking about a transformational, largest in HBCU history donation: big check on stage, with press involved and big PR campaign push after the fact. If that doesn’t show that we need to take a step back and get our own house in order, I don’t know what else does.”
     
            Gibbons has called for an independent investigation into the transaction.
     
            “I hope that this is a good gift. It could be transformative for the university and much needed. But we must vet the process, doing an announcement is not the first thing   you do …   Vet the individual. You vet the donation,” Vice Chair Gibbons said.
     
            Board Chair Kristin Harper provided a statement   to CNN on Friday saying, “Serious concerns have been raised regarding the validity of the gift, the adequacy of the due diligence processes and whether the Foundation Board and Board of Trustees have been provided ample oversight opportunity.”
     
            “I regrettably share these concerns” Harper added.
     
            On May 5, just one day after the announcement at commencement, FAMU released a  statement via X (formerly Twitter)  insisting the university had done its “due diligence.” The statement went on to say that Gerami had transferred $237,750,000 of stocks into a FAMU account last month.
     
            A non-disclosure agreement requested by Gerami prohibited officials from disclosing the details to either the university’s board of trustees or the board of directors, Vice President for University Advancement Shawnta Friday-Stroud said during an emergency meeting Thursday.
     
            “In addition to the wealth screening that was done at the beginning, we did a more expansive screening of Mr. Gerami’s background,” Friday-Stroud said.
     
            “We had a discussion with Dr. Robinson, all of which has been put out on social media. We said, ‘ok, we will proceed with the decision to move forward,” Friday-Stroud added.
     
            “My concern is our reputation has been greatly impacted and I want to make sure that we restore faith in our alumni and all of the friends and family that support Florida A&M University,” said FAMU Foundation Board member Terry Arnold.
     
            When reached by CNN on Thursday, Gerami declined immediate comment.  He referred questions to the university and agreed to answer CNN’s questions on the following day, but he couldn’t be reached.
     
            FAMU’s Special Board of Trustees, which oversees the full school and the foundation, has scheduled a  meeting for May 15  to discuss the donation.

81,Business,"McDonald’s and other fast food chains  are charging more . So much so that you may want to consider going for a slightly slower burger. Or at least, that’s what Applebee’s wants you to think about.
     
            “You can get our burger for $9.99,” John Peyton, CEO of Applebee’s parent company Dine Brands, told CNN in an interview. With that in mind, “why would you take a $10 burger … that you can eat in a bag out of your car?”
     
            If Peyton’s sales pitch   resonates with customers, it   could help convince diners   to eat at sit-down restaurants, something they might otherwise see as an indulgence.
     
            For a while, restaurant customers were trading down — swapping out expensive meals for cheaper ones, but still dining out. Now, some are responding to higher menu prices by trading out entirely: Instead of opting for cheaper restaurants or meals,  they’re eating more at home  and spending less when they do go out.
     
            That means that restaurants have to battle it out for these cost-conscious consumers. And now, it’s not just burger chain against burger chain.

       Restaurants are competing for frugal diners’ dollars 
     
            Because fast food joints have been hiking up prices in recent years, dine-in spots like Applebee’s can run promotions that end up costing about the same as a fast food lunch — giving them a chance to try to steal those customers away.
     
            The overlap offers “a new opportunity,” according to Peyton. Lunch at McDonald’s now costs about the same as lunch at Applebee’s, where you can sit at a table and have your meal delivered by a server. Pointing that out is a new way to bid for customers.
     
            Applebee’s, which has seen sales slump as lower-income customers pull back, is offering deals and hoping the prices will speak for themselves. Chili’s, on the other hand, is making the comparison more explicit.
     
            For them, and the fast food chains they’re now competing against, the stakes are high.
     
            Years of price hikes have  contributed to declining traffic , pushing   restaurants to fight over fewer customers, according to Henkes.
     
            “It’s a smaller pie today than it was a year ago,” he said. “You’re competing for a share of a smaller market. And so it is more competitive.”
     
            Fast food prices, in particular, have shot up. “Fast food has gotten really expensive,” Henkes said. “Certainly, relative to where it was 12 to 18 months ago, and also in comparison to casual dining sit-down restaurants right now.”
     
            In the 12 months through March, not adjusting for seasonal swings, prices at fast food and fast casual restaurants went up 5%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In that period full-service menu prices went up 3.2%, and grocery prices ticked up 1.2%.
     
            A few years ago, McDonald’s  said that it could raise prices without losing too many customers . But now, it’s struggling with lower-income customers.

       What went wrong at Red Lobster 
     
            CEO Chris Kempczinski said  during a February analyst call  that “the battle ground is certainly with that low-income consumer.” The following month, CFO Ian Borden conceded  during another analyst call  that “it’s a challenging consumer environment.”
     
            The chain is working on a $5 menu to win over those customers,  according to Bloomberg .
     
            Things aren’t much better over at Applebee’s.
     
            Sales at US Applebee’s locations open at least a year   slumped 4.6% in the first quarter. In that period, customers who earn $50,000 a year or less visited less often, and spent less when they did, Peyton said, adding that the demographic makes up about 45% of Applebee’s customers.
     
            “For several quarters… we’ve been asking ourselves, when will we see the impact of inflation, and the economy in general, and interest rates, on on our guest,” he said. “We really began to see it in the first quarter.”
     
            He added that “we think it’s going to be a fight for share of wallet and market share all year.”
     
            With fast food prices high, sit-down restaurants can make a case for themselves.
     
            People have taken their fast food price grievances to social channels,  some complaining about the price of McDonald’s burgers and hash browns . Chili’s has been paying attention.
     
            “Our social media team has been watching the conversation that the consumer is frustrated by fast food prices,” said Kevin Hochman, president of Chili’s and CEO of its parent company, Brinker International, during an April analyst call. In response, Chili’s decided to run ads that “use fast food as a foil,” he said.
     
            The chain said in an April press release that it was adding a new burger — which it described as having “twice the beef of a Big Mac and flavors fast food lovers will recognize” — to its ‘3 for me’ value menu. For $10.99, customers get the burger plus an app and a drink.
     
            On X, Chili’s  asked whether Chili’s is better than fast food , and promised rewards to those who said yes. Chili’s also ran video ads comparing its food favorably to fast food burgers.
     
            But it might not be that easy. Getting people to go to Chili’s instead of McDonald’s may be a stretch, said David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm.
     
            One problem for chains like Chili’s and Applebee’s is that they’re not so much competing on price, as they are on time.
     
            “People go to sit-down restaurants, generally speaking, for different occasions, than they go to fast food restaurants,” he noted. You might expect to spend an hour at a Chili’s or an Applebee’s, and breeze right through a McDonald’s.
     
            Still, campaigns like Chili’s can help communicate to customers that these days its   food is relatively cheap.
     
            “Planting that seed that, ‘Hey, we’re a good value,’ I think is a good message to have,” Henkes said.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/11/business/applebees-chilis-mcdonalds-prices/index.html,CNN,Fast food is expensive. Applebee’s and Chili’s are moving in,0

83,Entertainment,"Comedian Nikki Glaser started the week with her memorable performance roasting  Tom Brady  on Netflix and will cap it off with the debut of her new standup  special for HBO .
     
            Her sharp quips about the former NFL quarterback gained her thousands of new followers on Instagram and a hilarious appearance on ESPN’s “The Pat McAfee Show.”
     
            Glaser, however, is taking it all in stride. She’s been doing standup long enough to know the ups and downs of the entertainment industry.
     
            “I’ve never felt like when are people gonna get it? I’m not one of those people. I always feel like I kind of am getting what I deserve. I’m not someone who’s been waiting for this my whole life,” Glaser told CNN in an interview this week. “I mean, obviously this has been the goal to be beloved on this kind of scale, but it’s also scary because when it comes on fast like this, you know, this kind of enthusiasm for someone lasts for a moment but can go away pretty quickly.”
     
            Glaser said she knew Brady’s “Greatest Roast of All Time” would land with viewers.
     
            “I knew it was a home run and I knew that the event would be special because it was live,” she said. “I had hoped it would be number one on Netflix and that there would be viral moments, but I didn’t think that I would be a big part of all that discussion.”
     
            As the roast got closer, Glaser was ran her Brady jokes in up to four sets a night in Los Angeles, “jumping from club to club.”
     
            “Working with a team of writers, we would work during the day and then we would write in between shows and treat it like I was hosting an award show,” she said. “The way I would do it if I got asked to host the Oscars, like it’s that big of a deal. So, I took it really seriously.”
     
            Glaser also took her preparations seriously for her new special, “Someday You’ll Die.” In it, she covers substantive topics like having kids, body image and death, but promises fans both old and new will find plenty of laughs, too.
     
            “It’s just a look at my life right now as I’m approaching 40 and all my friends are having kids and starting families, getting married. I don’t really have any of that,” she said. “[The special explores] how I suffer with depression, despite the fact that my life is great, my fear of death, my longing for it at times, [with] really hard jokes in between.”
     
            Glaser describes her new work as “honest, raw, really tight comedy,” two years in the making.

84,Entertainment,"Editor’s note:  The following contains spoilers about the May 9 episode of “Young Sheldon.” 
     
            Anyone who watched “The Big Bang Theory” with any regularity over its 12 seasons knew what was coming as its prequel  “Young Sheldon”  comes to a close, but the knock at the door that ended the most recent episode still felt like a gut punch.
     
            As the young Sheldon Cooper (Iain Armitage) prepared to head off to college, he and his family learned that his father (Lance Barber) has died of a heart attack, the aftermath of which will be addressed in the two-part series finale on May 16.
     
            The moment seemed particularly cruel, inasmuch as the father, George Sr., had just been offered a long-sought opportunity to move up from coaching high school football into the college ranks, receiving an offer from Rice in Houston.
     
            “We always knew that there were a couple big moments that happened in Sheldon’s life, his father passes away and he goes to Caltech,” executive producer Steve Holland told CNN, adding that the decision was made to have that happen now – as opposed to during the final two episodes – so the characters could deal with its aftermath in the finale.
     
            According to Holland, series co-creator Chuck Lorre suggested that schedule of events, saying that after seven seasons of comedy (allowing for the occasional poignant moment), “Maybe we don’t want to leave the audience wallowing in grief at the end.”
     
            The elder Sheldon (Jim Parsons) had referenced his father’s death, and when it happened, during “The Big Bang Theory,” although with the benefit of hindsight he wasn’t always the most reliable narrator regarding his father and his perceived shortcomings – at least, based on how they played out in the second series.
     
            Although “Young Sheldon” is wrapping up, CBS viewers haven’t seen the last of the Coopers: the network has ordered another spinoff, featuring the characters of Georgie (Montana Jordan) and Mandy (Emily Osment) for the 2024-25 TV season – “Georgie & Mandy’s First Marriage” – which merely adds to the needle-threading act performed by the producers.
     
            Still, any concerns about setting up what comes next didn’t play into the “Young Sheldon” ending, Holland said, noting, “We were really just focused on ending this show as strong as we could.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/young-sheldon-episode-12-shock/index.html,CNN,,3
85,Entertainment,"Fifty years ago, two Swedish married couples went on the most consequential double date in music history, changing pop for good at the  Eurovision Song Contest .
     
            True, the bar wasn’t too high. 1974 was also the year that Paul Anka topped charts with “(You’re) Having My Baby,” a track that won a 2006 CNN survey of the  worst songs of all time.  
     
            But Abba – then  still available  in human form – have remained Eurovision’s de facto godparents as the event grew into the merriest, most colorful musical competition in the world.
     
            Now, 50 years on from their “Waterloo” breakout, the contest is back in Sweden, its spiritual home, after Loreen won the country’s seventh crown last May – becoming the first woman to win the competition twice.
     
            All these storylines coming together must be fate; incontrovertible proof that God is a Eurovision fan. You couldn’t have written it any better, right Loreen?
     
            “People are like ‘OK, Sweden is the spiritual home of Eurovision’ – I see Eurovision as this moving entity,” she tells CNN. “Who cares about the place?”
     
            OK, well, that’s not quite the narrative we were going for. But Loreen – who took the sparkly baton from ABBA and is now the undisputed Queen of Eurovision – must feel a tinge of emotion when she sees those four legendary faces on billboards all over host city Malmo… right?
     
            “I’m looking at ABBA and I’m like, I want to have those pants,” she exclaims. “Those platform shoes, where can I get those?”
     
            Listen, Loreen, can you just say something nice about ABBA, so we can move on from those digitally-rendered dinosaurs and talk about the runners and riders at Eurovision this year?
     
            “It really is a work of art, what they’ve created,” Loreen says obligingly, reflecting on the foursome’s musical and stylistic output. “The whole product, ABBA, is a vibe, isn’t it?”
     
            That it is. But ABBA are the past; Baby Lasagne, Windows95Man and Nemo – a person, not a fish – are very much the present.
     
            And this year’s competition is as moving, ridiculous, naked and powerful as ever.
     
            So just in time for  Pulitzer season , CNN has taken on the earnest task of studiously watching rehearsals and carefully analyzing every song, to bring you this: the definitive guide to the 2024 Eurovision Song Contest.
     
            Artists have been competing in two semi-finals this week, and 26 made it to Saturday’s grand final, which starts at 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. EST) in Malmo.
     
            To quote Malta’s vocal gymnast Sarah Bonnici: “Here we go aga…aaa..aaa..aa…ain, huh?”
     
            For the rest of Europe, hosting Eurovision is an unimaginable honor. For Sweden, it’s beginning to feel like that “quirky” friend’s improv troupe you’d promised you’d see, then promptly forgot about until the last minute, just as you’re stepping into a bubble bath with a glass of Pinot Grigio.
     
            This year’s fan park is  a bit budget , complain seasoned eurofans. Public rehearsals were half-full, and tickets remain for the final, with mere hours to go. Some even claim the show’s slogan - “United by Music” - may be influenced by last year’s slogan, “United by Music.”
     
            But Eurovision is a special part of the cultural calendar. “This community is the whole palette of what we are. Goofy, serious, nerdy,” Loreen says, counting adjectives on some unnecessarily long, golden fingernails. “Everything that you can imagine.”
     
            If there’s one thing the contest has taught her, it’s this: “You can actually feel real, authentic love for people that you don’t know, but you  do  know… you know?”
     
            Loreen will be performing as a guest during Saturday’s final, while 22-year-old identical twins Marcus and Martinus take the daunting mantle of competing for the host country.
     
            “We’re very competitive people; I think we’re the most competitive in the whole competition,” they say without a trace of irony.
     
            This year’s slim favorite is Baby Lasagne, whose arena-pounding anthem “Rim Tim Tagi Dim” describes a brain drain affecting Croatian towns. “Ay, I’m a big boy now; I’m going away and I sold my cow,” he chants.
     
            But Mr. Lasagne is nothing if not modest. He credits his fiancée with helping him launch his career – “She’s the lasagne, and I’m just the baby,” he tells CNN. “I don’t even like lasagne that much,” he adds, disappointingly. “I mean, it’s OK. I eat it a few times a year.”
     
            He’s juking it out with Switzerland’s Nemo, who came up with genre-bending epic “The Code” at Eurovision camp, a place whose mere mention would induce bewilderment to the non-European mind. “It was like a playground,” Nemo says. But now Nemo’s at the real thing, “and it’s even bigger and crazier than I expected it to be.”
     
            Ireland’s Bambie Thug is surging as the final approaches, and the Netherland’s Joost Klein is in with a shot. “I don’t mind winning, and I also don’t mind losing. I love being,” he says.
     
            No-one has had a bigger nightmare in Malmo than Windows95Man, whose entire persona revolves around an operating system whose name and logo cannot legally be shown at Eurovision.
     
            Teemu Keisteri, the genius behind the act, decided to wear a blurred version of the logo on his T-shirt instead. And he wears little else; Finland’s performance sees Windows95Man hatch from a giant egg, then run around with no trousers on for two minutes, before – spoiler alert – he’s eventually reunited with a pair of denim hot pants that descend from the ceiling.
     
            “In my late twenties, I figured out that I don’t need to be normal,” Windows95Man tells CNN. “I cannot control how the world sees my art.”
     
            And what is the message of this artwork, exactly? Windows95Man sums it up like this: “If Daddy is a little bit naked, it’s not so serious.” Which is not remotely a creepy thing to say.
     
            Europe is utterly obsessed with Eurovision. It’s all they think about year-round. Just ask Greece’s contestant, Marina Satti. “When I grew up I didn’t have a TV, so I kind of lost track,” she says. OK, never mind then.
     
            But more than 150 million people do watch every year. Some 129 artists entered San Marino’s national selection – around one Eurovision wannabe for every 260 people living in the microstate.
     
            And the contest is as much about the lovable weirdos as it is the winners.
     
            CNN’s prestigious, first annual award for the worst Eurovision lyric was hotly contested. We had some spectacular, cliched imagery to consider; Iceland’s Hera Bjork is “standing on the edge of a promise,” Saba is “throwing memories in the air,” and Slimane wants to “create an ocean in the fire.”
     
            “Hurricanes are roaming, but you take away the pain,” croons Azerbaijan’s  Fahree , who’s dressed like he’s come straight from the future – but not a cool part of the future, just a 23rd-century Italian restaurant with a poor hygiene rating.
     
            “Shining in a tiger’s eyes, only I can find my future,” Poland’s Luna sings, in a truly nonsensical piece of penmanship that failed to propel her to the final.
     
            But Norway’s Gåte take the crown, for this unemotional bit of scene-setting: “I was a very fine and beautiful maiden, with an evil stepmother. My mother had died,” the band explains at the start of their track. “She transformed me into a sword and a needle, and sent me off to the King’s estate.”
     
            The relentless publicists are Eurovision’s real heroes, pitching their artists in ludicrously bombastic terms. Latvia’s Dons creates “compelling, soul-stirring melodies,” we’re told. Luna “draws as much kind energy from the Moon as possible.” Armenia claims its folk-duo’s songs “have been said to transcend borders,” though it doesn’t explain who, exactly, has said this.
     
            And please make sure you’re sitting down for this – Cyprus’s Silia Kapsis, we’re informed, was once “featured in a dance documentary produced by Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas.”
     
            Portugal’s Iolanda, by contrast, is hyped as …  checks notes  … “a promising singer.” Sorry, Iolanda.
     
            Eurovision’s contestants are a humble bunch; all they want to do is sing their songs and heal our planet. “I tend to believe that we can change something with this show,” Joost Klein says. “This is quantum physics, bro,” adds Loreen. “We’re balancing things up in the world right now.”
     
            One might ask: if singing can really fix the world, why don’t these people just sing more? Why do they ever stop? Why isn’t a Eurovision contestant airdropped into every conflict zone in a sequined flak jacket, to wail and emote as loud as they can, until all the world’s leader are sat around a campfire listening to Italy’s Angelina Mango strum “Wonderwall” on her guitar?
     
            The reality is that a significant portion of Eurovision’s fanbase is uncomfortable with the  participation of Israel  during the country’s war on Gaza; climate activist Greta Thunberg led an anti-war protest in Malmo on Thursday, and another is planned on Saturday to coincide with the final. Israel’s contestant Eden Golan was audibly booed during the semi-final. The  European Broadcasting Union defended the decision to keep Israel at the competition to CNN this week.
     
            But for four hours on Saturday night, much of Europe will enjoy the escape that contestants are promising to provide. They’ll sit and watch obediently as a procession of sad-looking men wail about their exes in various states of undress. They’ll cheer on fierce girlbosses and overly-coiffed double acts as they drain Malmo’s supply of dry ice. And they’ll become entranced with a new set of oddballs gunning straight for the continent’s hearts.

86,Entertainment,"Seven years after  a trilogy that ended  with Caesar (Andy Serkis) leading his flock to the promised land, “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” didn’t exactly have a clear road map for where and how to revive the franchise. Given that, this latest addition surpasses expectations, honoring the source while building a muscular and even thoughtful adventure around a very ape-centric concept.
     
            Jumping several hundred years into the future, the new movie perhaps inevitably starts a bit slowly, in part because it’s starting almost completely from scratch in terms of characters and plot. While the premise sounds like the height of simplicity – the son of an invaded tribe embarks on a quest to find and save his brethren – the lens widens to lay out additional possibilities, although the film nicely stands on its own (and frankly, would probably be better if it just concluded where it did).
     
            The audience, ultimately, will determine whether “Planet of the Apes” swings again, but 56 years after the startling revelation that greeted Charlton Heston in the very first film, the idea has proven extremely hard to kill, evolving ( not always for the better ) in a variety of ways. What’s more, these movies are now distributed by Disney, which both knows something about film franchises and could use another, especially with other parts of its portfolio looking shakier in recent years.
     
            In this new telling, the story hinges on Noa (voiced by Owen Teague), whose peaceful existence is dealt a sudden, violent blow when the forces of Proximus Caesar (Kevin Durand) – an ape who yearns to expand his kingdom – attack, killing many and taking the survivors captive.
     
            Noa takes off after them, encountering a wise orang, Raka (Peter Macon), and a human woman ( “The Witcher’s”  Freya Allan), who clearly knows more than the feral people to which the apes are accustomed, but whose interest in Proximus and joining Noa on the dangerous search to find him represents a source of mystery.
     
            A veteran of the “Maze Runner” movies, director Wes Ball and writer Josh Friedman cover a great deal of ground in setting all that up, and still find time to throw in moments of humor and clever homages to the original movie. The visual effects are especially good and convincing, a must when the vast majority of characters are digitally rendered, while communicating using a mix of sign and spoken language.
     
            The real magic, though, comes in taking such a familiar blueprint in directions that manage to feel surprising, not reinventing “The Planet of the Apes” but reinvigorating it in satisfying ways despite lacking the glue Serkis provided in the most recent run.
     
            Hollywood blockbusters aren’t normally the place one goes to see old dogs learn new tricks, but these “Apes” prove that even old-fashioned cash grabs don’t have to be devoid of ingenuity or ambition. Whether that translates into an appetite for revisiting this planet, give credit where it’s due for a leap into the unknown that, for the most part, sticks the landing.

87,Entertainment,"Brian Wilson , musician and founding member of the hit ’60s rock band The Beach Boys, has been placed under a conservatorship following a Los Angeles court ruling on Thursday.
     
            Judge Gus T. May of the Los Angeles Superior Court found “clear and convincing evidence” that a conservatorship is necessary, court documents said, noting that Wilson consents to the conservatorship.
     
            According to the court documents, Wilson is “unable to care for his person,” has a “Major Neurocognitive Disorder” and “lacks capacity to give informed medical consent for medications.”
     
            Wilson’s conservators are ordered to consult with his children regarding all material related healthcare decisions, the court documents said.
     
            According to the Wilson family, the decision to place Brian under a conservatorship came following the death of his wife, Melinda Wilson, in January.
     
            At the time, Wilson  called his wife his “anchor,”  saying in a post on his website that “Melinda was more than my wife. She was my savior. She gave me the emotional security I needed to have a career. She encouraged me to make the music that was closest to my heart.”
     
            In a  statement published in February , the Wilson family said that after “careful consideration and consultation” among Brian, his children, his housekeeper and his doctors, “longtime Wilson family representatives LeeAnn Hard and Jean Sievers will serve as Brian’s co-conservators of the person” following Melinda’s passing.
     
            This decision was made, the statement said, to “ensure that there will be no extreme changes to the household,” as well as making sure that “Brian and the children living at home will be taken care of and remain in the home where they are cared for by (housekeeper) Gloria Ramos and the wonderful team at the house who have been in place for many years helping take care of the family.”
     
            “Brian will be able to enjoy all of his family and friends and continue to work on current projects as well as participate in any activities he chooses,” the family’s statement concluded.
     
            Wilson has had a tumultuous relationship with the spotlight, having suffered from fame-induced stress, depression, and drug addiction in the past. He decided to quit touring with his band after a nervous breakdown in 1964, though he continued to write, arrange, produce and record The Beach Boys’ music.
     
            Wilson and The Beach Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 and received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001.
     
            Wilson has also won two Grammy Awards as a solo artist, for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2005 and Best Historical Album in 2013.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/entertainment/beach-boys-brian-wilson-conservatorship-judge-rules-intl-scli/index.html,CNN,,3
88,Politics,"The Senate voted on Thursday   to pass a major federal aviation bill ahead of a key Friday deadline.
     
            The bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill would renew authority for the agency for the next five years and aims to improve aviation safety, enhance protections for passengers and airline workers and invest in airport and air travel infrastructure nationwide.
     
            The House will next need to pass the legislation.
     
            The bill would authorize more than $105 billion in funding for the FAA as well as $738 million for the National Transportation Safety Board for fiscal years 2024 through 2028.
     
            Among a wide range of provisions, the legislation  seeks to address  the nation’s shortage of air traffic controllers with directives aimed at expanding hiring, includes strengthened consumer protections for refunds for flight cancellations and delays, and would implement technology to reduce the risk of runway collisions.
     
            Although there is broad bipartisan support for the legislation, the package touched off contentious debate over some of its provisions.
     
            One flashpoint centered around  flights at Reagan National Airport  just outside of Washington, DC – with a group of Washington area Senate Democrats who oppose adding more longer-distance flights in and out pressing for an amendment vote to strip it out of the package. Ultimately, however, there were no votes on amendments.
     
            Some lawmakers argue that adding flights will give consumers more choices and bring down prices, while others say it would increase congestion and delays at the airport.
     
            The House voted on Wednesday to pass a one-week extension for federal aviation programs, a stopgap move intended to head off a  looming end-of-week deadline.  Congress is up against a Friday deadline to reauthorize FAA authorities. This will move that deadline to next Friday, May 17. The Senate passed that weeklong extension via unanimous consent on Thursday night, giving the House until next week to send the package to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature.

89,Politics,"The  Biden administration said Friday  that it is “reasonable to assess” that US weapons have been used by Israeli forces in  Gaza  in ways that are “inconsistent” with international humanitarian law but stopped short of officially saying Israel violated the law.
     
            The  report  which was  drafted by the State Department  said that investigations into potential violations are ongoing but noted that the US does “not have complete information to verify” whether the US weapons “were specifically used” in alleged violations of international humanitarian law.
     
            “Given the nature of the conflict in Gaza, with Hamas seeking to hide behind civilian populations and infrastructure and expose them to Israeli military action, as well as the lack of USG personnel on the ground in Gaza, it is difficult to assess or reach conclusive findings on individual incidents. Nevertheless, given Israel’s significant reliance on U.S.-made defense articles, it is reasonable to assess that defense articles covered under NSM-20 have been used by Israeli security forces since October 7 in instances inconsistent with its IHL obligations or with established best practices for mitigating civilian harm,” the report said.
     
            The report, which covers the period from the outbreak of the  war with Hamas  on October 7 to late April, did not find that Israel has withheld humanitarian aid to Gaza in violation of US law.
     
            Although the report does not find Israel in violation of either of the terms of the memorandum, it is sharply critical of the toll of Israel’s military campaign. The findings of the report mark another stark moment in US-Israeli relations in the same week President Joe Biden  threatened to restrict weapons transfers  if Israel goes ahead with a major offensive in Rafah.
     
            Still, the ultimate finding that Israel’s assurances made under the national security memorandum are “credible and reliable” has already raised scrutiny among some lawmakers and incredulity among human rights and humanitarian organizations.
     
            The report did not mandate any actions be taken by the Israeli government, and it does not trigger any policy changes. The administration has largely avoided restricting military assistance to Israel, but in a significant shift ahead of the release of the report, Biden declared publicly in an interview with CNN this week that if Israel proceeds with a major offensive in the Gazan city, he would restrict the transfer of certain offensive weapons to Israel.
     
            The high-stakes report was declassified and   transmitted to Capitol Hill on Friday afternoon. The administration was required to make a determination on those two matters under a February national security memorandum, which Biden issued under pressure from Democratic lawmakers. It was the first time the US government had to make an assessment about Israel’s conduct in the seven months of the war with Hamas in Gaza, triggered by the terror group’s brutal October 7 attack, that has left more than 34,000 people dead and much of the coastal enclave destroyed.
     
            Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen, the driving force behind the creation of the national security memorandum, expressed disappointment in the report.
     
            “The administration ducked all the hard questions about making the actual determination,” the Maryland Democrat told reporters Friday evening. “I think what they’re trying to do is make clear that they recognize how bad the situation is, but they don’t want to have to take any action to hold the Netanyahu government accountable for what’s happening.”
     
            Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, agreed with Van Hollen’s remarks, telling CNN that the report is “a massive diplomatic dodge.”
     
            “On the one hand, it says that it’s very reasonable to conclude that there’s been restriction of aid, it’s very reasonable to conclude that our weapons have been used in violation of international law and then it proceeds to say that we just don’t want to give an answer on that yet,” Merkley said on “Erin Burnett OutFront.”
     
            The Oregon Democrat is one of the few members of Congress to step foot in Rafah, visiting in January.
     
            “Clearly, politics come into this and strategy comes into this, but it is frustrating because it’s so important at this moment that we use the leverage we have to persuade Israel to change its conduct,” he said.
     
            Earlier Friday, Van Hollen also said that “the purpose of this report was not to provide a snapshot in time” and accused the administration of taking Israel’s assurances at “face value,” despite investigations by human rights groups finding violations of the law.
     
            However, a senior State Department official said that it was always intended to be retrospective, and that there are processes underway to evaluate ongoing activity. There is no deadline for any conclusions to be made under those processes.
     
            The report notes that “in any conflict involving foreign partners, it is often difficult to make swift, definitive assessments or determinations on whether specific U.S. defense articles or services have been used in a manner not consistent with international law.”
     
            “However, there have been sufficient reported incidents to raise serious concerns,” it said.
     
            “While Israel has the knowledge, experience, and tools to implement best practices for mitigating civilian harm in its military operations, the results on the ground, including high levels of civilian casualties, raise substantial questions as to whether the IDF is using them effectively in all cases,” the report said.
     
            According to the senior State Department official, the compilation of the report has been a useful tool for the Biden administration to go to the government of Israel and insist on getting information, and on behavior changes. That official said the report would be shared with the Israeli government.
     
            Biden administration officials have for months called on Israel to do more to curb the civilian death toll and allow more aid into Gaza. On humanitarian aid, the report notes the US government “has had deep concerns during the period since October 7 about action and inaction by Israel that contributed significantly to a lack of sustained and predictable delivery of needed assistance at scale, and the overall level reaching Palestinian civilians – while improved – remains insufficient.”
     
            However, it states that they “do not currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of U.S. humanitarian assistance within the meaning of section 620I of the Foreign Assistance Act,” which bars assistance to governments found to be intentionally restricting aid.
     
            The report calls the “the impact of Israel’s military operations on humanitarian actors” a specific area of concern, citing a series of incidents, including the  deadly strike  on a World Central Kitchen aid convoy.
     
            Following that strike last month, Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu in a call that Israel had to do more to address the humanitarian situation or there would be a change in US policy. In recent weeks, US officials said Israel had taken important measures following that conversation, but that more still needed to be done. However, following the launch of “limited” Israeli military operations in Rafah, where millions of Palestinians have fled, humanitarian aid access has once again plummeted.
     
            The report was the subject of intense debate for months across the administration. Human rights organizations have assessed that Israel’s military campaign has violated humanitarian law.
     
            Late last month, Amnesty International assessed that US-supplied weapons to Israel have been used “in serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, and in a manner that is inconsistent with US law and policy.”
     
            An Amnesty International official said Friday that “this report seems like the international version of ‘thoughts and prayers’: admitting there’s a problem but not doing anything meaningful to prevent the further loss of lives.”
     
            “Despite President Biden’s vague comments earlier this week, his administration today made its position loud and clear: it points fingers and takes swift action when an actor the US government considers an adversary violates international law, but treats the government of Israel as above the law, even while acknowledging the overwhelming evidence that Israeli forces are violating international law and killing Palestinian civilians with US weapons on US taxpayer dime,” said Amanda Klasing, National Director of Government Relations and Advocacy at Amnesty International USA.
     
            Van Hollen on Friday said that “it is not credible that the US government has less information than organizations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Oxfam.”
     
            A senior State Department official said they couldn’t speak to the standards for the assessments made by those organizations but said the US government process was very diligent and took into consideration any accountability measures undertaken by the Israeli government.
     
            The president also acknowledged to CNN that “civilians have been killed as a consequence of” US-supplied bombs. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller on Thursday said Biden was speaking to “the tragic loss of civilian life throughout this conflict,” not a legal determination under international humanitarian law.
     
            Humanitarian aid organizations also questioned the findings of the report.
     
            “We are confused and dismayed by the Biden administration’s report to Congress, and in particular, its findings that Israel is not impeding the provision of aid to Gaza,” said Kate Phillips-Barrasso, vice president of global policy and advocacy at Mercy Corps.
     
            “Humanitarian organizations have publicly and repeatedly detailed a litany of obstructions by Israel over the last seven months that have made it impossible to deliver humanitarian assistance to the 2.2 million people in Gaza whose lives depend on it,” she said.
     
            “Yet more compelling than the testimony of aid organizations is the horrifying situation of the population of Gaza, trapped in a conflict zone and facing starvation,” she continued. “If humanitarian aid were being adequately facilitated—as the NSM calls for—1.1 million people would not be facing catastrophic famine conditions a few miles away from available food. The very fact that the US government has airdropped assistance and spent significant effort and resources constructing a floating pier for maritime deliveries indicates officials had already come to the conclusion that aid delivery was being ‘directly or indirectly’ impeded.”

90,Politics,"President Joe Biden’s  decision this week to make public  his ultimatum that a  major Israeli offensive  in the city of Rafah would result in a shut-off of some US weapons did not come easily or lightly.
     
            It came after multiple rounds of phone calls with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, starting in mid-February, urging him to reconsider his plans to invade the densely populated city in southern Gaza that has been a critical conduit for humanitarian aid.
     
            Hours and hours of virtual and in-person meetings between Biden’s top national security lieutenants and their Israeli counterparts were intended to send the same message, according to officials: There are other ways to go after Hamas, Biden’s aides laid out, that stop short of invading a city where more than a million Palestinians have gone to seek safety, officials said.
     
            At multiple levels, the president and his team warned Netanyahu that a major invasion of Rafah wouldn’t be aided by American weapons. It was a message the White House believed was well understood by  the government in Israel,  White House officials said Thursday.
     
            Still, making those warnings public  was a step Biden had long been wary of taking . Doing so would amount to a turning point, and the biggest break in US-Israel ties since the start of the war in Gaza following the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas. Even under pressure from progressives in his own party to take steps to limit humanitarian suffering in Gaza, Biden has been careful to avoid an open rift with Netanyahu.
     
            Still, in Netanyahu’s war cabinet meetings, a decision to go into Rafah appeared imminent. The Israel Defense Forces have now established a presence in Rafah and along its border, choking off two aid entry points and warning of a larger offensive to come.
     
            Ultimately, officials said, Biden came to believe his warnings were going unheeded and so he changed course.
     
            Last week, Biden signed off on a pause of 3,500 bombs to Israel that administration officials feared would be dropped on Rafah. And on Wednesday, sitting at a community college in Wisconsin for an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Biden made explicit to the world what he said he’d already made obvious to Netanyahu in private.
     
            “If they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities – that deal with that problem,” Biden told Burnett.
     
            The president’s aides said the message shouldn’t have been a surprise to their intended recipients in Israel.
     
            “I can assure you the direct and forthright nature with which he expressed himself and his concerns in that interview with Erin Burnett is consistent with how he has expressed himself to Prime Minister Netanyahu and to Israeli officials,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday.
     
            The Israeli government, Kirby said, “has understood … for some time now” the implications a major Rafah offensive would have on the future of American arms shipments.
     
            Aware or not of the president’s views, Israeli officials reacted with shock to the public announcement. Netanyahu was defiant.
     
            “If we need to stand alone, we will stand alone. I have said that, if necessary, we will fight with our fingernails,” he said Thursday. Israeli officials also sought to downplay the significance of Biden’s announcement. A spokesman for the IDF, Daniel Hagari, said Israel already has the weapons it needs for the missions it is planning.
     
            In addition to 2,000-pound bombs, Biden told CNN that artillery could be held up in the event of a Rafah invasion. Despite being smaller in size than the bombs, the Biden administration views artillery as indiscriminate and imprecise weapons that can exact a dangerous toll in urban areas.
     
            Israel has claimed its current campaign in Rafah is “limited,” a description US officials have echoed. But behind the scenes, doubts linger about Israel’s intentions, CNN has learned, with limited clarity provided to the US on how it plans to proceed.
     
            Throughout the course of the conflict, Biden’s frustration with Netanyahu has grown, even as the US president maintained publicly that his support for the state of Israel was unwavering.
     
            Biden has made clear that no matter what course the Israel-Hamas war takes, the US would remain Israel’s most stalwart ally so long as he is president. That conviction, advisers said, was separate and apart from the evolution of the president’s relationship with Netanyahu.
     
            “Israel is not the same thing as Netanyahu,” a senior Biden adviser told CNN.
     
            Rafah has hardly been the only irritant in the relationship. In the telling of Biden’s close advisers, the IDF’s accidental killing in early April of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza – one of them an American citizen – broke the president’s already strained patience.
     
            Upon learning the news, Biden expressed fury, advisers said. He made clear to advisers that he saw the deaths of the aid workers as an unacceptable “breakdown” in some of the most fundamental ways in which he expected Israel to conduct its war, and that the moment required a new response. His team quickly arranged a phone call with Netanyahu.
     
            Several weeks prior, Biden had shared with friends on Capitol Hill – in comments that were caught on a hot mic – that he and the prime minister were likely headed towards some kind of rupture. He predicted the two leaders were due for a “come to Jesus” moment.
     
            Multiple advisers did not deny that Biden’s phone call with Netanyahu in April was, at the very least, as close to such a “come to Jesus” moment as the two leaders had had up until that point. In the brief call, Biden issued a new warning to Netanyahu: If Israel did not course-correct, the US would reconsider how it supports its ally in the conflict.
     
            It marked the clearest signal yet that six months into the war, Biden was starting to seriously consider conditioning US support for Israel. But even then, it was not known what exactly those consequences might look like, and what actions from Israel would ultimately push Biden over the edge.
     
            Since their call, the White House has praised Israel for taking steps to increase humanitarian aid, including opening additional crossings. Yet Rafah continued to shadow the relationship, as Israeli officials insisted on the necessity of going after Hamas in the city, even as Biden aides said they hadn’t seen a plan to protect civilians there.
     
            Meetings between the two sides failed to yield consensus on the issue, according to people familiar with the matter. White House officials were unconvinced by Israel’s plans to protect civilians and made clear in public statements that an invasion of the city would amount to a humanitarian disaster.
     
            “The president and his team have been clear for several weeks that we do not support a major ground operation in Rafah, where more than a million people are sheltering with nowhere safe to go,” Kirby said on Thursday. “The president has said that publicly and he has communicated that repeatedly and straightforwardly to Prime Minister Netanyahu.”
     
            After Biden’s CNN interview, officials stressed the White House position on conditioning aid is a hypothetical one: The US would only pare back the equipment and weaponry provided to its longstanding ally if it launches the invasion of Rafah.
     
            That didn’t stop the president’s critics from accusing him of renouncing Israel, despite his clear statement that he wasn’t “walking away from Israel’s security.” Across the GOP spectrum, from former President Donald Trump to Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, Biden’s political opponents likened the announcement to a message of an abandonment amid an ongoing war with terrorists.
     
            House Speaker Mike Johnson, who’d just survived  an ouster attempt , even suggested in an interview with Politico that Biden had a “senior moment” when he made the remark.
     
            Some Democrats also voiced criticism. Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, a staunch supporter of Israel, said that he disagreed with Biden’s plan to withhold some weapons shipments to Israel, warning the move “demonstrates to Hamas that they’re winning the PR war.”
     
            “I am concerned about that, and I don’t agree with the president,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju.
     
            Sen. Jon Tester, a vulnerable Democrat from Montana, said, “I think he should release it” when asked about Biden’s handling of the weapons shipments. And Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin said he was planning to speak with administration officials about the details of their plan later Thursday.
     
            “I’m trying to find out legally what they’re doing and the reasons for it,” he said. “So, until I’ve had a chance to talk to the administration, I’m going to defer making any specific comments.”
     
            Even though the president’s position amounted to his toughest public stance on Israel since the start of the war, it also appeared to do little to satisfy those in his own party who have agitated for an end to US support.
     
            “I think it’s a good step forward. I think we’ve got to do even more,” Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont democratic socialist, said on CNN, adding Biden’s warning about conditioning weapons “should have come a lot earlier.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/inside-bidens-public-ultimatum/index.html,CNN,Inside Biden’s decision to go public with his ultimatum to Israel over Rafah,1

            One of Trump’s former White House aides later took the stand, testifying about the comings and goings in the West Wing and breaking down in tears about how she lost her job and her book that was highly positive toward the former president.
     
            At the end of the day, the proceedings heated back up as Trump’s attorneys argued, out of the presence of the jury, for a mistrial and to lift Trump from the gag order from speaking about Daniels. Judge Juan Merchan denied both motions.
     
            Here are the takeaways from Day 14 of the Trump   hush money trial:
     
            Daniels returned to the witness stand Thursday morning for a second day of cross examination, in which she combatively and defiantly responded to questions from Necheles and insisted her story about her sexual encounter with Trump was true. Trump has denied the affair.
     
            Trump’s attorney asked about inconsistencies in interviews Daniels has given about how her dinner with Trump was arranged, whether they had dinner and the notion that she felt threatened by Trump during the encounter.
     
            She noted that Daniels saw men and women naked regularly through her work in adult film movies – questioning why then, allegedly seeing Trump on his bed in boxers and a T-shirt “was so upsetting that you got light-headed, the blood left your hands and feet and you almost fainted?”
     
            “If I came out of the bathroom and saw an older man in his underwear that I wasn’t expecting to see there, yeah,” Daniels responded.
     
            Necheles also asked how she described the encounter ,  pointing to a prior interview in which she said Trump told her “come here” and they started kissing on the bed. He did say “come here,” Daniels said in response.
     
            “You made all this up, right?” Necheles said.
     
            “No,” Daniels responded.
     
            Necheles continued again with the insinuation turning to Daniels’ work as a writer of adult films. “You have a lot of experience of making phony stories about sex appear to be real,” Necheles asked.
     
            Wow,” Daniels said   with a pause. “That’s not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real just like what happened to me in that room.”
     
            Beyond the details of the alleged encounter itself, Trump’s attorneys and prosecutors had Daniels tell conflicting accounts of her financial situation.
     
            Necheles continued to suggest that Daniels was making money off of saying she had sex with Trump, pointing to a tweet where she said she’d earned $1 million and others   where she directed her supporters to her online store after Trump was indicted.
     
            “You’re celebrating the indictment by selling things from your store,” Necheles asked.
     
            “Not unlike Mr. Trump,” Daniels responded.
     
            Trump’s attorney also questioned Daniels about her “Make America Horny Again” strip club tour in 2018 – showing posters she had promoted – and about the money she made through an NBC documentary, in which the filmmakers paid for the rights to her book.
     
            During re-direct, prosecutors had Daniels recount how telling her story has also cost her, from having to move her daughter and hire security to the lawyers’ fees she was ordered to pay after she sued Trump and lost.
     
            “On balance has your publicly telling the truth about your experiences with Mr. Trump been net positive or net negative in your life?”
     
            “Negative,” Daniels said.
     
            Former White House aide Madeleine Westerhout described the inner-workings of Trump’s West Wing, where she worked for more than two years sitting just outside the Oval Office.
     
            Westerhout  was asked about a list of Trump’s contacts she received from his longtime Trump Organization assistant Rhona Graff – a list that included everyone from television news personalities like Joe Scarborough and Jeanine Pirro (who was at the courthouse Thursday) to sports legends Serena Williams and Tom Brady.
     
            Eventually working at a desk with a direct line of sight to the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, Westerhout explained how she learned Trump’s work habits. Trump liked sharpies, for instance, and printouts of documents. He preferred the Oxford comma. And the former president, she said, “liked speaking to people in person or on the phone.”
     
            Asked how many people Trump would typically speak to in a day, she couldn’t cite a specific number. “A lot,” Westerhout said. He would take calls as early as 6 a.m. and “late into the night” after she had gone to bed, she testified.
     
            The prosecution walked Westerhout through the checks she would receive from the Trump Org. in New York, in which she described bringing Trump a manilla envelope of checks each month to sign. She then sent them back to New York.
     
            Westerhout did not testify to direct knowledge of the checks that Trump signed to his former fixer Michael Cohen, which are cited in the charges that Trump falsified business records, but her story did add one more voice to the prosecution’s narrative that Trump was involved in signing of the checks in 2017.
     
            When asked to explain how she left the White House in 2019, Westerhout testified that she said some things she shouldn’t have and that she was “very regretful of my youthful indiscretion.”
     
            “I’ve grown a lot since then,” she said as she started crying.
     
            She was still sniffling as defense started cross examination, in which Necheles asked Westerhout about the book she wrote after leaving the White House, “Off the Record.” Westerhout said she “thought it was real important to share with the American people the man that I got to know.”
     
            “President Trump forgave you, right?” Necheles asked. “He did,” Westerhout said. “He was a really good boss.”
     
            Westerhout also offered jurors a contrast to Daniels’ account, testifying that Trump was close to his wife Melania and his family. The former president smiled as she described Melania Trump often texting her, “Madeline, it’s past dinner time. When is my husband coming home?”
     
            Trump’s lawyers asked Merchan both to declare a mistrial and modify the gag order against him after Daniels was off the stand. The judge rejected both requests.
     
            Trump attorney Todd Blanche asked for Trump to be allowed to publicly defend himself against Daniels’ allegations, arguing the former president currently is forced to stay silent in response to the suggestion that there was a non-consensual sexual encounter between her and Trump.
     
            Blanche argued that Daniels has changed her story by suggesting that this “completely made-up encounter with President Trump may not have been consensual.”
     
            Yet, Blanche said, “he is not allowed to say ‘I did not do that’” for voters who are seeing media coverage of the testimony.
     
            Merchan denied the request, saying he must protect the integrity of the proceedings and he doesn’t trust Trump not to violate an order if he were to modify it.
     
            “The reason why the gag order is in place to begin with is precisely because of the nature of these attacks, the vitriol,” Merchan said. “These were very real, very threatening attacks on potential witnesses.”
     
            “Your client’s track record speaks for itself here – I can’t take your word for it” that Trump will stick to disputing the facts, the judge also said.
     
            Merchan also denied Trump’s renewed motion for a mistrial over the salacious testimony Daniels gave that his attorneys say unfairly prejudices the jury against Trump.
     
            The judge said Trump’s outright denial of the incident and his legal team’s attack on her credibility opened the door for prosecutors to bring in Daniels’ testimony that turned salacious.
     
            “The more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh whether the encounter did occur and if so whether they choose to credit Ms. Daniels’ story,” Merchan said.
     
            Merchan pointed the finger at Necheles who opted not to object to several salacious lines of questioning that the defense later used as reasons the judge should declare a mistrial.
     
            Blanche argued that Daniels’ testimony at trial was a new version of the alleged events – a point Merchan disagreed with.
     
            Prosecutor Josh Steinglass said Trump was aware of the “messy details” of the encounter in 2016 and that shows motive for the hush money payment and cover up.
     
            Blanche argued that the level of detail prosecutors elicited from Daniels went too far. But Merchan said “details like items in the bathroom, the weight of the furniture,” add a “sense of credibility if the jury chooses to believe them,” even as he acknowledged there were some details he would have preferred stayed out.

92,Politics,"Louisiana officials asked the Supreme Court on Friday to intervene in the  ongoing legal fight  over the state’s congressional districts, urging the high court to quickly resolve a dispute that has essentially left the state without a viable map for this year’s election.
     
            The emergency appeal came days after civil rights organizations and a group of Black voters separately asked the Supreme Court to step into the case.
     
            “Five days out from May 15 — the date by which the Louisiana Secretary of State needs to begin implementing a congressional map for the 2024 elections — Louisiana has no congressional map,” state officials told the Supreme Court. “Louisiana’s impossible situation in this redistricting cycle would be comical if it were not so serious.”
     
            At issue is a map drawn by state lawmakers that included a second majority-Black district in Louisiana’s six-district congressional plan. A conservative-leaning lower court  struck down that map  last week, finding that it violated the Constitution’s equal protection clause.
     
            That new map with the two majority-Black districts was drawn in response to another court order that found an earlier map, which had only one majority-Black district, likely ran afoul of the Voting Rights Act. Civil rights groups say the two rulings have left the state “without a congressional map just months away from the 2024 elections.”
     
            The Supreme Court has asked the voters who challenged the second map for a response to the civil rights groups by midday Monday, setting up a possible decision as early as next week, once all the filings are submitted.
     
            Louisiana specifically asked the justices Friday to rely on a legal doctrine  called the Purcell principle , which it sometimes invokes to stay out of messy election lawsuits as voting season approaches.
     
            The lower court’s “late-breaking” ruling “plus the court’s blowing through election deadlines in search of an imaginary, litigation-proof 2024 congressional map” should be enough to allow the most recently drawn map to stand for now, the state argued.
     
            Because the case raises fundamental questions about how mapmakers consider race when they redraw congressional boundaries every decade, the Supreme Court’s decision could have national implications. It could also affect control of the US House, given the narrow majority Republicans currently hold in that chamber.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/louisiana-congressional-map-supreme-court/index.html,CNN,Louisiana urges Supreme Court to quickly resolve congressional map fight in emergency request,1
93,Politics,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  said he’s against government limits on abortion at the federal or state level, backing legal abortions through the entire gestational period while arguing the state should not play a role in determining abortion access.
     
            In a podcast interview with Sage Steele that was released Wednesday, Kennedy said he doesn’t “trust government to have jurisdiction over people’s bodies” and believes “we need to leave it to the woman … to make those decisions.” Kennedy stressed he believes “every abortion is a tragedy” and pledged as president to make child care more affordable to reduce pressures on women who are considering abortion due to high costs.
     
            When pressed by Steele if he supports allowing individual states to determine abortion access for women, Kennedy said, “We shouldn’t have government involved.”
     
            “I wouldn’t leave it to the states. My belief is that we should leave it to the woman. We shouldn’t have government involved,” Kennedy said.
     
            “Even if it’s full term?” Steele asked, referring to the possibility of an abortion near the expected delivery date of a child.
     
            “Even if it’s full term,” Kennedy replied.
     
            The position stands in contrast with  previous statements  Kennedy has made on abortion, and with how his running mate Nicole Shanahan has characterized his abortion position. In an interview with Steele released last week, Shanahan said, “My understanding is that he absolutely believes in the limits on abortion.”
     
            When pressed by Steele to confirm if Kennedy supported no government limits on abortion, Shanahan said, “That is not my understanding of his position, and I think maybe there was a miscommunication there.”
     
            In a statement to CNN, Kennedy campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear said the candidate believes “late-term abortions are horrifying” and that the “the mother has the final say, and moral responsibility, in such decisions.”
     
            “He is committed to reducing the abortion rate by supporting mothers and families and implementing universally affordable child care,” Spear said.
     
            Kennedy’s comments to Steele reflect the most explicit articulation of his views on state or federal gestational limits on abortion. Last year, Kennedy told a reporter he would  support a three-month federal abortion restriction , but his campaign quickly walked back that position. Kennedy has often avoided answering directly whether he supports limits on abortion while highlighting his plan to subsidize child care and expand access to adoption services.
     
            Kennedy acknowledged to Steele there is “a compelling argument” that the government should set a gestational limit on abortion access. He also conceded that his position is “not a very satisfactory outcome” because of the potential for “instances where bad things happen.”
     
            “I think there’s a very, very good argument, a compelling argument that the state has a interest in protecting a fully formed fetus. I absolutely think that that argument is very convincing,” Kennedy said. “But again, I come down to the fact that I don’t trust the state, and I think we need to trust the woman. And I don’t think that that’s a satisfactory outcome because there’s always going to be instances where bad things happen.”
     
            Kennedy said he believes cases where a woman would potentially undergo a late-term abortion would be driven by “extenuating circumstances” but reiterated his belief that the choice to have an abortion should be determined solely by the mother.
     
            “I don’t think any woman ever, ever in history has said, ‘I’m going to have a, you know, I’m going to have a baby, I’m going to get pregnant and carry that baby to eight months term and then I’m going to terminate the pregnancy.’ I don’t think anybody wants to do that,” Kennedy said. “I’m sure it has happened. I would say in almost all those cases, there’s extenuating circumstances.”
     
            “But I think, ultimately, nobody sets out to do that,” he added later. “And there are always some kind of extenuating circumstances that would make a mother make that kind of choice, a terrible, terrible choice which is, you know, you can’t overstate how bad that is. And I think, ultimately, we have to trust women.”
     
            Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a leading anti-abortion group, slammed Kennedy on Thursday for his remarks, with the group’s president calling him a “true extremist.”
     
            “He would use the power of the federal government to wipe out protections for life in the states and impose unlimited abortion on demand all the way up to ‘full term,’ as he puts it, everywhere in America. That makes him unacceptable to millions of pro-life voters nationwide,” Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement.
     
            Angela Stanton King, a Kennedy campaign adviser who has helped him with outreach to Black voters, criminal justice and abortion policies, criticized the candidate’s comments on Friday. She said it was the first time she had heard him voice such a perspective.
     
            “It is inexcusable to take the life of a full-term baby. Abortion at this stage does not prevent the need for delivery, as the baby must still be birthed, whether alive or deceased,” Stanton King  said .

94,Politics,"A federal appeals court on Friday  upheld the contempt-of-Congress conviction  of Steve Bannon, the ex-adviser to former President Donald Trump who was found guilty after failing to comply with a subpoena from the House January 6 committee.
     
            Bannon’s conviction — and now, the DC Circuit’s affirmation of that conviction — is a boost to Congress’ leverage in its efforts going forward to obtain cooperation in its investigations.
     
            The US DC Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously rejected several challenges Bannon made to the case, including his claim that the trial court excluded evidence he should have been allowed to put before the jury in his defense.
     
            Bannon was sentenced to four months in federal prison, and that sentence was also upheld Friday by the appeals court. The ruling could pave the way for Bannon to eventually report to prison, though the timing is unclear.
     
            The judge who presided over Bannon’s trial previously agreed to let him hold off from serving his sentence while his appeal played out. In its ruling Friday, the three-judge appeals panel gave Bannon time to appeal its ruling to the full DC-based appeals court before it formally notifies the trial judge that the conviction was upheld.
     
            Bannon could also turn directly to the Supreme Court for additional appeals, possibly further delaying when he needs to start serving his prison term.
     
            Bannon’s attorneys did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment.
     
            In the DC Circuit’s new ruling, Judge Bradley Garcia, an appointee of President Joe Biden, backed the trial judge’s exclusion of an advice-of-counsel defense, as Bannon had claimed he had rebuffed the subpoena because of supposed executive privilege concerns expressed to him by his lawyer.
     
            “This exact ‘advice of counsel’ defense is no defense at all,” Garcia wrote, noting that the contempt law only required proof that Bannon “deliberately and intentionally” did not respond to the subpoena.
     
            His opinion was joined by Judge Cornelia Pillard, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, and Trump-appointed Judge Justin Walker.
     
            The appeals court noted that “the communications from former President Trump’s counsel” that Bannon had tried to rely on to defend his conduct did not purport “to authorize Bannon’s refusal to produce any documents or appear for his deposition.”
     
            The DC Circuit also rejected Bannon’s argument that the House select committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection was improperly formed.
     
            “These objections suffer from a common defect,” the judges wrote. “Bannon did not raise them before the Select Committee and therefore forfeited them.”
     
            Bannon is one of two former members of Trump’s inner circle who faced prosecution for not participating in the House January 6 probe. The second, former Trump White House aide  Peter Navarro , is currently serving a four-month prison sentence for his 2023 conviction.
     
            When the now-defunct House panel sought documents and testimony from Bannon in 2021, it pointed to alleged communications between Bannon and Trump in the days leading up to the January 6 Capitol attack, as well as comments Bannon made on his podcast the day before the riot that “all hell is going to break loose tomorrow.”
     
            Bannon for some time served in Trump’s White House, but by the time of Trump’s crusade to overturn his 2020 electoral loss, Bannon had long left the federal government.

95,Politics,"US intelligence officials are watching closely to see if the  United States’ support for Ukraine  will lead the Russian government to take more risks in potentially interfering in the 2024 presidential election, a senior FBI official told reporters Thursday.
     
            FBI officials are concerned that the  war in Ukraine  – and  President Joe Biden ’s reliable backing of Kyiv – might be an “animating event for the Russians,” the FBI official said at a briefing with reporters about election security efforts. “We’re certainly… keeping our eye out to make sure that that’s not increasing [their] risk taking.”
     
            The FBI briefed reporters on the condition that the senior FBI officials not be named.
     
      
       Related article 
       Russia sees window of opportunity to expand attacks as Ukraine awaits further US aid, officials say 
     
            A clear divide has emerged in US politics, with Democrats largely backing Biden’s financial and military support for Ukraine, and some leading Republicans, including  former President Donald Trump  and  congressional GOP hardliners , increasingly backing away from the foreign aid.
     
            US officials are concerned that, with  US military aid to Ukraine  potentially on the line in the November election, Russia could be motivated to more aggressively meddle in the 2024 election than it did in 2020. But US officials have not publicly identified any examples of that happening yet.
     
            In the 2020 election, Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations to denigrate Biden, support Trump and undermine confidence in the US electoral process, according to a declassified  US intelligence report . But Russia’s actions in 2020 weren’t as brazen or far-reaching as its  hack-and-leak operations  to help Trump and undermine Hillary Clinton’s candidacy in 2016, according to US intelligence agencies.
     
            The FBI official’s comments on Thursday echo those made by a senior National Security Agency official in March.
     
            “I think where we diverge in this election cycle is Russia is very motivated to make sure that that the focus on support to Ukraine is disrupted,” Rob Joyce, who headed NSA’s Cybersecurity Directorate before retiring in late March, told reporters. “I think you’ll see the themes of their activities all pushed through a lens of what is going to erode support for Ukraine.”
     
            Asked by CNN if that makes Russia more likely to interfere in the 2024 US elections compared to 2020, Joyce said: “I don’t know that it makes them more likely, but it does make them dangerous.”
     
            During Thursday’s FBI press briefing, a second senior FBI official said that Russia likely views  US election infrastructure , including state and local government networks, as “legitimate targets” for cyber-espionage and data collection.
     
            “Russia can use their access to those government networks to undermine confidence in the US election integrity and bolster influence operations,” the second FBI official said.
     
            The FBI officials also singled out China and Iran as other governments that could be willing to interfere in or influence the 2024 US election.
     
            In the 2020 election, China  considered  conducting influence operations aimed at changing the outcome of the election but chose not to, according to the  US intelligence report . Iran, meanwhile, conducted a “multipronged covert influence campaign” aimed at hurting Trump’s election bid, the report said.
     
            Artificial intelligence, the first FBI official said, increases the ability of sophisticated state actors “to scale their operations and … really build them out larger than we’ve seen previously.”

96,Politics,"Jack Quinn, former White House counsel and powerhouse Washington, DC, lawyer and influencer, passed away Wednesday at the age of 74.
     
            That is the obituary headline of a man who used his wonderful life to make a difference in American politics and public policy.
     
            A New York-born son of a power plant manager and a homemaker who was the first in his family to go to college, Quinn was ambitious and service-minded from the start. It was at the prestigious Georgetown University law school where Quinn got the political bug that led him to Capitol Hill, campaigns and eventually to the White House as  President Bill Clinton ’s counsel during the turbulent years of the  Whitewater investigation .
     
            The powerbroker and top lobbyist in more recent years used his experience and know-how to represent family members of those killed in the  September 11, 2001, attacks  in  lawsuits alleging Saudi Arabia’s culpability .
     
            But the man I had the privilege of knowing was so much more.
     
            Outside of all that, I knew him as a friend; a husband who loved my dear friend Susanna, his wife of 17 years, with all of his heart; and a father who adored his eight children and 12 grandchildren.
     
            John Michael Quinn - “Jack” - was the kind of person who would send a text of encouragement out of the blue, greet you with his giant smile and a twinkle in his eye no matter how he was feeling and was always eager to show love and affection to his large family and friends.
     
            Looking back today at my texts from Jack, it was not uncommon to see “I love you” from him in the thread.
     
            But he was also someone who showed extreme kindness to people he barely knew.
     
            Jack was a CNN legal analyst for several years during the Trump administration, sharing his insights and vast expertise with our viewers on a regular basis.
     
            Elie Honig, now a senior CNN legal analyst, told me that he remembers being very new to television and meeting Jack in the green room.
     
            “I, of course, knew who Jack was, but he’d have no reason to know me aside from my first handful of on-air appearances. I hadn’t even met him in person yet, and he went to the effort of getting my email address and sending me a note welcoming me and saying I was doing a great job. I’ll always remember that gesture,” he told me, while noting that Jack was always “sunny” even when his health issues became more challenging.
     
            Those health issues, a lung disease that eventually took his life, made his CNN appearances harder and harder.
     
            But his impact is indelible.
     
            One of our talented makeup artists remarked to me when learning of Jack’s passing how kind and solicitous he always was - no matter the time or the circumstance, which is not always the case in the stressful and unpredictable world of cable news.

97,Politics,"One of Donald Trump’s closest White House aides wrapped up her testimony Friday in the  former president’s hush money trial , clearing the way for the prosecution’s key witness to take the stand on Monday.
     
             Michael Cohen , Trump’s former fixer and lawyer, is expected to testify Monday, according to a person familiar with the case, where he will speak to the hush money agreement he helped negotiate in 2016 with Stormy Daniels and how Trump repaid him the following year.

       Michael Cohen set to testify at Trump hush money trial Monday 
     
            Cohen’s testimony is the lynchpin to prosecutors’ charges that Trump illegally falsified business records by concealing the reimbursement of Cohen to keep the payments hidden before the 2016 election.
     
            In anticipation of calling the former president’s onetime fixer, however, prosecutors introduced a slew of text messages and phone records into evidence for the jury, via several custodial witnesses.
     
            Prosecutors say it’s entirely possible they could rest their case by the end of next week.
     
            Here are the takeaways from day 15 of the Trump hush money trial:
     
            Cohen is expected to take the stand Monday, putting him face-to-face with his former boss.
     
            He is expected to testify to his role in negotiating the hush money payment to Daniels on Trump’s behalf, as well as how he was reimbursed through retainer payments in 2017 that are at the heart of the charges against Trump.
     
            With Cohen’s testimony implicating Trump, however, comes all of the baggage that accompanies the former president’s longtime fixer. Cohen himself was federally charged with campaign finance violations, tax crimes and lying to Congress in previous testimony.
     
            He’s changed his story as he turned from loyal Trump defender to chief antagonist after  pleading guilty to the federal charges in 2018 .
     
            His testimony in the fall during Trump’s civil fraud trial foreshadowed some of the challenges prosecutors can face having him on the stand, as he appeared to change his story about the direction he received from Trump about his financial statements during his testimony.
     
            Cohen’s credibility with the jury may make-or-break Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s case, so it will be high stakes for the prosecution when Cohen is sworn in next week.
     
            Ahead of Cohen’s expected testimony, Trump attorney Todd Blanche urged Judge Juan Merchan to order Cohen to stop talking about the trial and Trump.
     
            Trump is not allowed to talk about Cohen because of the gag order in place. But, Blanche said, Cohen is nevertheless allowed to attack him, pointing to a TikTok video Cohen posted this week wearing a T-shirt showing Trump behind bars.
     
            “Our request that the court order the government to instruct the witness to not talk about president trump or this case until the case is over,” Blanche said.
     
            Assistant District Attorney Joshua Steinglass responded that prosecutors have repeatedly instructed Cohen and all of the other witnesses in the case not to speak publicly about it. “The fact of the matter is, we have no control over what they do,” he conceded.
     
            Merchan has already said he cannot gag witnesses in the case. But he sympathized with Blanche’s position and said that he would “direct the people to communicate to Mr. Cohen that the judge is asking him to refrain from making any more statements” about this case or Trump.
     
            Merchan told the prosecutors to send the message saying that it “comes from the bench and you’re communicating that on behalf of the bench.”
     
            Cohen has posted on social media attacking Trump since the trial began, though he claimed at one point he was going to stop. Trump, often in response, has repeatedly been found in violation of the judge’s gag order for his comments about Cohen.
     
            Trump exchanged smiles with his former White House assistant Madeleine Westerhout, who wrapped up her testimony Friday that began one day prior. She raised her eyebrows and smiled at Trump who smiled back at her and mouthed something as she left the courtroom.
     
            On cross-examination, Trump attorney Susan Necheles pressed Westerhout to reiterate that she knows the former president to care about his family.
     
            Westerhout testified that she remembered Trump was upset after the Stormy Daniels story came out in 2018. Westerhout acknowledged on the stand that he didn’t specifically speak about his family in their conversation about the story, but, “My understanding was he knew it would be hurtful to his family.”
     
            Westerhout testified that Trump signed scores of documents a day while multitasking on the phone or in meetings, and she said she’d seen him signing checks without reviewing them.
     
      
       Related article 
       Ex-Trump Org. CFO sentenced to 5 months in jail after testifying falsely about size of Trump triplex apartment 
     
            She also testified that personal mail like Trump’s checks used a back channel via an employee’s home address so he could get and handle them faster than if they were processed by the White House’s cumbersome system for processing personal mail.
     
            Westerhout also distanced Trump from then- Trump Org. Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg  once he took office.
     
            “In fact, you really don’t recall any calls specifically between him and Allen Weisselberg?” Necheles asked.
     
            “No, he spoke to so many people,” Westerhout said.
     
            Trump’s former assistant said she’s “not even sure it’s true” that Trump spoke with Weisselberg about a check – something prosecutors have suggested in reference to the Cohen reimbursements.
     
            After Westerhout left the stand, prosecutors spent the rest of the day calling a series of custodial witnesses to introduce cell phone records into evidence.
     
            It made for a dry day of testimony, but it also provided key evidence that prosecutors plan to use to try to convince the jury that Trump is guilty of falsifying business records.
     
            Those records included a summary of the 34 charges against Trump – 11 invoices, 12 vouchers, and 11 checks. Through a Manhattan district attorney’s office paralegal, prosecutors introduced a summary explaining how the charges correlated with the documents in evidence.
     
            In addition, prosecutors introduced a series of text messages between Stormy Daniels’ then-manager Gina Rodriguez and National Enquirer editor in chief Dylan Howard in 2016.
     
            In the messages, the two discuss whether American Media Inc. would buy Daniels’ story – and for how much – before giving a play-by-play of the status of the negotiations and payment Cohen ultimately made to Daniels’ attorney in late October 2016.
     
            The texts are notable because neither Howard nor Rodriguez is expected to testify in the trial. Some of the texts were introduced through David Pecker, who was Howard’s boss, but prosecutors used a paralegal to show more of them to the jury this week.
     
            “We’re not doing the Trump deal,” Rodriguez texted Howard on October 17, 2016.
     
            “Keith (Davidson) gave me a heads up. What happened?” Howard responded.
     
            “They didn’t pay when they said they would and they keep trying to buy more time,” Rodriguez responded.
     
            The texts corroborate what Daniels and Davidson have testified so far that the deal briefly fell apart in mid-October – and will also likely help bolster Cohen’s credibility when he takes the stand next week.
     
            Steinglass said that prosecutors expect to call two more witnesses, and then rest. “And I think it’s entirely possible we will rest by the end of next week,” he added.
     
            When the prosecution rests, it will be Trump’s turn. It’s not clear how long he will put on a case in defense – a question that is likely to rest largely on whether or not Trump himself takes the stand.
     
            The judge also threw a potential curveball of his own on Friday when Trump’s lawyers objected to allowing the settlement agreement of Weisselberg into evidence.
     
            Trump’s lawyers argued that the severance agreement was prejudicial to the jury, calling Weisselberg an “uncalled government witness” because he is currently in jail after  pleading guilty  earlier this year to perjury charges.
     
            Prosecutors responded that the settlement agreement itself would help to explain why Weisselberg was not called and also argued that they expect Weisselberg to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.
     
            Merchan interjected by asking prosecutors whether they had actually compelled Weisselberg to testify, which they had not.
     
            “It seems to me we want to explain why he’s not here without taking the effort of trying to explain that we tried to get him here,” Merchan said, suggesting they could bring Weisselberg in without the jury present to see what he would say.
     
            Prosecutors did not seem thrilled by the idea – Trump’s attorneys noted he wasn’t on prosecutors’ original witness list – but it’s the kind of unexpected appearance that could extend the length of the trial.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/takeaways-friday-may-10-trump-trial/index.html,CNN,Takeaways from Day 15 of the Donald Trump hush money trial,1
98,Politics,"President Joe Biden on Friday signed a one-week extension for federal aviation programs ahead of a key deadline after the Senate passed the measure Thursday night, the White House announced.
     
            The president, who is currently traveling in San Francisco, signed the Federal Aviation Administration funding extension using the autopen – a device used for automatic signatures – in order to ensure there was no lapse in funding, a White House official said. The bill was transmitted to the White House Friday afternoon, the official said.
     
            The use of the autopen, which was first used by President Barack Obama to sign legislation, has been a rarity in the Biden administration. The White House has gone to great lengths at times to fly physical bills to  Biden while he’s traveling abroad, including a $40 billion Ukraine aid package the president signed while in South Korea in 2022 and a 2022 bill to avert a government shutdown while the president was on vacation in St. Croix.
     
            The Senate also approved a bipartisan FAA reauthorization bill that renews authority for the agency for the next five years on Thursday night. The House will next need to pass that legislation.
     
            That bill would renew authority for the agency for the next five years and aims to improve aviation safety, enhance protections for passengers and airline workers and invest in airport and air travel infrastructure nationwide. The bill would authorize more than $105 billion in funding for the FAA as well as $738 million for the National Transportation Safety Board for fiscal years 2024 through 2028.
     
            Among a wide range of provisions, the legislation  seeks to address  the nation’s shortage of air traffic controllers with directives aimed at expanding hiring, includes strengthened consumer protections for refunds for flight cancellations and delays, and would implement technology to reduce the risk of runway collisions.
     
            Although there is broad bipartisan support for the legislation, the package touched off contentious debate over some of its provisions.
     
            One flashpoint centered around  flights at Reagan National Airport  just outside of Washington, DC – with a group of Washington area Senate Democrats who oppose adding more longer-distance flights in and out pressing for an amendment vote to strip it out of the package. Ultimately, however, there were no votes on amendments.
     
            Some lawmakers argue that adding flights will give consumers more choices and bring down prices, while others say it would increase congestion and delays at the airport.
     
            The House now has until next week to pass the Senate-passed, five-year reauthorization bill and send it to Biden’s desk.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/biden-week-faa-extension-autopen/index.html,CNN,Biden signs one-week FAA extension via autopen,1
99,Politics,"Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh told an Austin judicial conference on Friday that his experience in the George W. Bush administration has made him more skeptical of presidential assertions of regulatory power.
     
            His comments on the issue (he also discussed Taylor Swift and Caitlin Clark) were especially salient in light of the many challenges to the Biden administration policies on which the court is expected to rule by the end of June.

            Referring to his 2001-2006 tenure as a lawyer for Bush, Kavanaugh said he was “in the room” as regulations were written and saw first-hand the “pressures” on administrations to push the limits of their statutory power, whether over the environment, immigration or health care.
     
            “It gives me a good, for want of a better term, B.S. detector,” he said. “When the executive branch says, ‘We can’t possibly do this.’ … I think to myself … I saw it done.”
     
            Kavanaugh observed that presidential candidates regularly campaign on a reform agenda but then become stymied in their priorities by the legislative process and congressional gridlock. That creates an incentive for presidents to push the boundaries of their regulatory authority, he said, emphasizing that the phenomenon affects both political parties.
     
            “The judiciary is there to help police those boundaries,” Kavanaugh said.
     
            The comments of Kavanaugh, a 2018 appointee of former President Donald Trump, may hint at the conservative court majority’s resolution of pending disputes testing the bounds of an array of federal regulation. Since the six-justice conservative majority coalesced in 2020, the court has taken longer strides to constrain federal regulators, from the environment and consumer finance to public health and workplace safety.

            Business groups, backed by Republican-run states, contend the Chevron principle has led to unlawful bureaucratic intrusions and given the government the upper hand in litigation.
     
            The Biden administration, defending the Chevron precedent and multiple agency policies now under challenge, has stressed the importance of executive-branch expertise and comprehensive nationwide protections for the public good.
     
            Kavanaugh’s hourlong appearance Friday in the ballroom of an Austin hotel came as the high court enters its tensest weeks, negotiating in private to resolve dozens of cases by the traditional late June deadline. He answered questions from 5th Circuit Chief Judge Priscilla Richman at the circuit’s annual judicial conference.

            By and large, Richman’s questions were on the lighter side, including those that opened a window on Kavanaugh’s extracurricular life. He said that his two high school daughters, now a sophomore and senior, control much of his off-bench time.
     
            He attended his first Taylor Swift concert in 2012, he told Richman after she asked if he had attended an  Eras Tour concert .
     
            Yes, the justice said, Kavanaugh describing himself as “way ahead of the curve” with his Swiftie fandom.
     
            And he has taken his daughters to multiple NCAA basketball tournaments, including the  first round in Iowa last March .
     
            The justice recounted that on the Thursday night before that tournament weekend, his older daughter was talking about players she knew, from her own high school basketball team, that would be competing against Iowa’s Caitlin Clark.
     
            Kavanaugh’s younger daughter said, “We should go!”
     
            A few beats later, Kavanaugh agreed: “We should go. We went. … I got on StubHub, got the tickets, got the flights, probably one of the most expensive 48 hours.”
     
            But he added, “To go to Iowa and see the phenomena of Caitlin Clark. That’s a lifetime memory that I did on the spur of the moment.”
     
            On a far more serious note about his daughters, Kavanaugh said that they have grown up with constant court police security.
     
            Asked about the intense security for individual justices since 2022, when the opinion reversing Roe v. Wade first leaked, the justice said his security detail is “24/7 at the home” and accompanies him when he travels.

100,Politics,"The  Biden administration  on Thursday proposed a rule that would allow immigration officials to rapidly reject migrants who are ineligible for asylum, casting the new regulation as a measure to enhance  border security .
     
            The proposed rule, which is narrow in scope, doesn’t change asylum eligibility but would allow immigration officials to more quickly remove migrants who are ineligible for asylum earlier in the asylum process.
     
            “The proposed rule we have published today is yet another step in our ongoing efforts to ensure the safety of the American public by more quickly identifying and removing those individuals who present a security risk and have no legal basis to remain here,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement Thursday.
     
            The move comes as the White House has tried to toughen its position on the US-Mexico border and flip the script on Republicans who continue to hammer President Joe Biden on immigration ahead of the  November election .
     
            Asylum officers, under the proposed rule, would be able to reject asylum claims within days of a migrant being encountered when there is evidence that they pose a national security or public safety risk. Under current procedures, that often happens later in the process.
     
            The department also announced Thursday that asylum officers would need to consider whether an asylum seeker could “reasonably relocate to another part of the country of feared persecution when assessing claims” under revised guidance.
     
            “We’ve taken a series of measures to expand our use of executive authority and resources in order to address what we are seeing on our border and really, throughout the whole hemisphere,” a senior Homeland Security official told reporters, citing congressional inaction.
     
            The rule, which will be published Monday, still needs to go through a public comment period before taking effect later this year, according to the senior DHS official.
     
            Politico  first reported  on the proposed changes.
     
            Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut acknowledged ahead of the announcement that the administration was pursuing asylum changes, but noted that without legislation, making full scale changes to the asylum system is incredibly difficult.
     
            Murphy told reporters Wednesday he’s been engaged with the administration on the policies under review, but noted fuller scale changes that Republicans want Biden to make risk being challenged in court.
     
            Senate Democrats are going to keep pushing for the  failed bipartisan immigration bill  to get more GOP support, Murphy said, adding that at this point, it’s not clear the measure would get another vote.

101,Politics,"Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday detailed the  medical abnormality  he experienced in 2010 that he said was caused by a worm that entered his brain and then died, marking his first public explanation of the incident.
     
            Kennedy said he recalls experiencing “brain fog” and “having trouble with word retrieval and short-term memory,” during that period in a podcast interview on “Pushing the Limits with Brian Shapiro.”
     
            He was initially told by doctors that he had a tumor in his brain, and was planning to have it removed before he met with another doctor who looked at images of his brain and said it didn’t look like a tumor, Kennedy said.
     
            After the doctor measured the abnormality and determined that it hadn’t grown, Kennedy continued, “they said that this is almost certainly a parasite that got into your brain … it’s a parasite that’s very common in India where I had done a lot of environmental work.”
     
            According to the  New York Times , which first reported the incident on Wednesday, Kennedy had said during a 2012 deposition, which concerned a divorce from his second wife, that a doctor had told him his health issues could be “caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died.”
     
            In a statement to CNN Wednesday, Stefanie Spear, a spokesperson for Kennedy’s campaign, said he had “traveled extensively in Africa, South America and Asia” as part of his work as an environmental advocate and said he contracted a parasite in one of those trips.
     
            “The issue was resolved more than 10 years ago and he is in robust physical and mental health. Questioning Mr. Kennedy’s health is a hilarious suggestion, given his competition,” the campaign said, referring to the advanced ages of the 81-year-old President Joe Biden and 77-year-old former President Donald Trump.
     
            Dr. Peter Hotez, an infectious disease expert and Dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told CNN that it’s difficult to fully review Kennedy’s claim without looking at the scans. “It’s an incomplete story,” as he put it.
     
            But, speaking generally, Hotez said people with pork tapeworm infections in their brains — a condition known as neurocysticercosis — more commonly experience seizures and sometimes need to be on anti-seizure medication for a long time because when the worms die, they form a calcified cyst in the brain that can cause the brain to release inflammatory chemicals called cytokines.
     
            Kennedy on Wednesday also detailed his experience with a bout of mercury poisoning, which he   said occurred around the same time he was diagnosed with a parasite in his brain. Kennedy said tests showed his blood containing “sky high” levels of mercury, and said he underwent chelation therapy to remove the metals from the body.
     
            “At the same time, I was having my mercury tested, and I was getting all kinds of tests, and my mercury test came back sky high. So, ten times what, you know, the EPA levels were for blood mercury, I think it was,” Kennedy said. “They were over ten times what– what anybody considered safe. And I had that chelated out and all of that brain fog went away.”
     
            Kennedy said he has made a full recovery from both health incidents.

102,Politics,"Hunter Biden’s latest attempts to throw out his federal gun case were rejected in back-to-back rulings Thursday, teeing up a high-stakes criminal trial next month in Delaware.
     
            The president’s son had asked the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals to dismiss the charges by overturning  prior decisions  from the trial judge that let the case move forward. But the appellate panel instead rejected Hunter Biden’s appeals, which related to his defunct plea deal and his claims that the case was tainted by political bias.
     
            Hours later, the trial judge, Maryellen Noreika, rejected Hunter Biden’s remaining motion to dismiss the case based on Second Amendment grounds.
     
            The rulings pave the way for the first-ever trial against the child of a sitting US president. They’re also a victory for special counsel David Weiss, who is prosecuting Hunter Biden in two separate criminal cases and is fending off aggressive pushback from his lawyers.
     
            With the gun case intact, Hunter Biden now faces a legally and politically perilous summer, with back-to-back trials while his father focuses on the 2024 campaign. The gun trial is slated to begin in early June unless the parties reach a plea deal or some other agreement to resolve the case, which is always possible. A separate tax trial is scheduled to begin in late June.
     
            “In reviewing the panel’s decision, we believe the issues involved are too important and further review of our request is appropriate,” Biden’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement about the appeals court ruling, suggesting that he may ask the full Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit to rehear the appeal.
     
            Prosecutors claim Biden illegally purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018, which  violated federal law  because he was using illicit drugs at the time. He has pleaded not guilty to all three felony counts.
     
            His attorneys have argued that the charges trample his Second Amendment rights and that “possessing an unloaded gun for 11 days was not a threat to public safety.”
     
            Noreika, a Trump appointee who was confirmed with wide bipartisan support in the Senate, refused to dismiss the gun indictment last month. She also previously presided over Hunter Biden’s  botched plea deal hearing  last summer.
     
            Hunter Biden is also facing a  federal tax indictment , and that trial is slated to begin in late June in California. He has pleaded not guilty to all nine charges in that case, which revolves around millions of dollars he made in Ukraine, in China and through other overseas deals.
     
            Weiss’ team successfully argued that the appellate court didn’t have jurisdiction to review whether Noreika made any mistakes earlier this year while rejecting Hunter Biden’s motions to dismiss the gun case.
     
            “This appeal is dismissed because the defendant has not shown the District Court’s orders are appealable before final judgment,” the three-judge appellate panel wrote in a four-page ruling.
     
            They turned away his attempts to review lower-court decisions about the legality of Weiss’ appointment and whether last year’s botched plea deal – which would’ve resolved the case – was still active.
     
            In rejecting his appeal Thursday, the 3rd Circuit panel said those types of deals with prosecutors “do not implicate a right not to be tried” and wouldn’t give Hunter Biden additional avenues to pursue appeals.
     
            The decision was unanimous and based on procedural grounds. The three-judge panel included one Republican appointee and two Democratic appointees, including Judge Cindy Chung, who was put on the bench by President Joe Biden.
     
            Further, the ruling could make it harder for Hunter Biden to appeal his loss in the Second Amendment challenge, which Noreika rejected Thursday.
     
            Hunter Biden’s attorneys argued the three gun charges should be tossed out because the firearm-possession statute used against him violated the Second Amendment of the US Constitution.
     
             The specific statutes involved in the case make it a crime to lie on federal firearm forms about using illicit drugs, and also make it illegal to own a gun while using those drugs.
     
            Hunter Biden’s attorneys, citing a  recent decision from the 5th Circuit  – which does not cover the state of Delaware, where he was charged – argued that under the Second Amendment, an individual “can no longer be denied gun ownership due simply to past drug use.” But the trial judge disagreed in her ruling Thursday.
     
            “The current state of the law on the facial constitutionality of (the statute) is decidedly not in Defendant’s favor,” Noreika wrote. “No appellate court has agreed with his position, and possibly only one district court has found (the statute) unconstitutional on its face. This Court ultimately sides with the great majority of cases upholding the facial constitutionality of (the statute).”
     
            In the 5th Circuit case, US v. Daniels, the conservative-leaning appeals court said the federal gun law that prohibits users of illegal drugs from possessing firearms was unconstitutional. In reaching that conclusion, the appeals court cited a landmark 2022 Supreme Court decision that  changes the framework that lower courts must use  when analyzing gun restrictions.
     
            Prosecutors handling Hunter Biden’s case have called the 5th Circuit decision “mistaken.” They also noted Hunter Biden’s own admission to using illicit drugs while he allegedly purchased and possessed a revolver in 2018.
     
            Noreika on Thursday also rejected an attempt by Hunter Biden to obtain internal Justice Department documents that could shed light on any attempts by former President Donald Trump and his appointees to interfere with the long-running criminal investigation.
     
            As part of an effort to find evidence that Hunter Biden was being politically targeted, his attorneys asked for any documents about him that involved Trump, former Attorney General Bill Barr, other top Justice Department officials or several US attorneys.
     
            But the judge turned down that request Thursday. She  previously rebuffed  Hunter Biden’s bid to throw out the case because of the supposed politicization, noting that even though Trump did call for Hunter Biden’s prosecution while he was president, the charges were filed under President Joe Biden’s watch and with oversight from Biden’s appointees.
     
            “Defendant has failed to show how any of the requested communications among former DOJ and Executive Branch officials could constitute exculpatory evidence as applied to him and the three firearm-related offenses being pursued here,” Noreika wrote Thursday.

103,Politics,"The Biden administration is set to unveil a sweeping restructuring of former President Donald Trump’s trademark  tariffs on Chinese imports,  according to sources familiar with the matter.
     
            The announcement, expected as early as next week, would see tariffs dialed up significantly in some industries seen  as strategic to the US economy  and kept in place or dialed back in others deemed less critical to national security, the sources said.
     
            Importers of electric vehicles, solar components and critical minerals made in China are likely to see those levies rise significantly – to as high as 100% in the case of electric vehicles, these sources said.
     
            The changes come as President Joe Biden refines a campaign pitch based on protecting domestic industries from state-sponsored competition, while encouraging clean energy investments in the US that have become the pillars of his presidential platform.
     
            The changes are the result of a mandatory review that the Office of the US Trade Representative began in 2022, two years after the US and China’s “Phase One” trade deal went into effect, formalizing the tariff levels that Trump was known to set on social media. Under US trade law, the economic impact and effectiveness of tariff programs must be studied and investigated every four years.
     
            Adam Hodge, former aide at Biden’s National Security Council and the Office of the US Trade Representative, said the new tariffs – taken together with other policies enacted by Treasury and Commerce – should ease some anxiety among the electorate.
     
            “The Biden administration has neutralized China as a campaign issue,” said Hodge, now a managing director at Bully Pulpit International.
     
            Trump – Biden’s opponent in November and the architect of the existing tariff program that taxes some $300 billion in Chinese goods at US ports of entry –  has proposed charging  a 60% tariff on all goods coming from China and 10% on goods imported from everywhere else.
     
            Biden’s proposal would represent a more curated approach, albeit an approach that is inherently a response to actions already initiated by his predecessor.
     
            Some economists have warned that increased tariffs risk reigniting a trade war with China, hurting the US economy in the process. Tariffs are essentially a tax on US businesses and consumers,  adding to the cost of imported goods.  That could send inflation higher and hurt job growth.
     
            Americans have paid more than $230 billion to date for tariffs that Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum and Chinese-made goods, according to  US Customs and Border Protection . More than half of the duties have been collected during the Biden administration.
     
            Strategic importance to the economy, in an election year, also carries political importance.
     
            Both candidates have been campaigning across the manufacturing-heavy swing states known as the “blue wall” critical to both candidates’ prior election victories.
     
             In an April speech in Pittsburgh,  nicknamed “Steel City,” Biden called for the tripling of tariffs on imported steel, aluminum and shipbuilding materials – an effort to raise the cost of non-US products to promote American manufacturing and jobs.
     
            The Biden administration had planned to release the results of the review in advance of the Pittsburgh speech, the sources familiar with the matter said, but ended up delaying the release.
     
            The Office of the US Trade Representative now faces a deadline at the end of May to decide whether companies whose products had been granted exclusions from certain tariffs would see those exclusions extended or denied. The office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
     
            Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen discussed US concerns with China’s non-market practices in bilateral meetings with Chinese leaders in early April, concerns echoed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken in meetings later that month.
     
            Yellen is planning to join other finance ministers in the Group of Seven nations representing the world’s wealthiest democracies in Italy at the end of May, where the group will discuss the agenda for the upcoming June summit in Puglia, Italy.
     
            For more than a year, the Biden administration has been urging its allies in the European Union to place hefty tariffs on electric vehicles imported into the bloc, stressing the risk China poses to domestic car manufacturing and urging solidarity in standing up to a non-market economy.
     
            “It’s important for the US to make this move in advance of the EU’s investigation into Chinese EVs,” said Clete Willems, partner at Akin Gump and former deputy director of the National Economic Council during the Trump administration. Willems said the US’ position as a first mover on EV tariffs would give the EU “air cover.”
     
            The European Commission faces a July 4 deadline to decide how to proceed in its own investigation into electric vehicle subsidies.

104,Politics,"Former President  Donald Trump ’s youngest son, Barron Trump, has declined to serve as a delegate at this summer’s  Republican National Convention , according to a senior Trump campaign adviser and a statement from Melania Trump’s office.
     
            “While Barron is honored to have been chosen as a delegate by the Florida Republican Party, he regretfully declines due to prior commitments,” the statement from the former first lady’s office said.
     
            Barron Trump, who turned 18 in March,  had been selected  by the Florida GOP to serve as an at-large delegate at the July convention. Several other Trump family members – including Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump – were also selected as delegates.
     
            The  Daily Mail  first reported Barron Trump declining to serve as a delegate.
     
            The Republican National Committee will hold its  convention in Milwaukee  in July. Donald Trump has said he will likely announce his running mate around the RNC convention in July and has been  floating several names both in public and private .
     
            Earlier Friday, he talked about his relationship with his youngest son but didn’t address his role as a delegate.
     
            The presumptive Republican presidential nominee on Friday praised Barron Trump in a radio interview and said his 18-year-old son sometimes offers him political advice.
     
            “He’s a great guy. He’s a little on the tall side, I will tell you. He’s a tall one. But he’s a good looking guy, and he’s really been a great student and he does like politics. It’s sort of funny, he’ll tell me sometimes, ‘Dad, this is what you have to do,’” Donald Trump said in the radio interview with Kayal and Company.
     
            He continued, “So anyway, he’s a good guy. He’s a senior now in high school and he’ll be going to college. And you know a lot of these choices of colleges are changing because you see what’s going on in the last month, Biden has totally lost control of the country.”

105,Politics,"Desperately needed humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza will at least for the next few days remain sitting off the coast of Gaza on an American Navy cargo ship, as the US continues to face obstacles to getting the  floating pier it has constructed  in place and operational in the eastern Mediterranean.
     
            The pier and causeway, known as Joint Logistics Over the Shore or JLOTS, will ultimately be used by the US, its allies and aid groups to get aid into Gaza by sea from Cyprus. But the system had to be moved to the Port of Ashdod last week due to heavy seas, and it still hasn’t left.
     
            Even when JLOTS becomes operational, the weather and sea conditions may severely limit the ability to use the floating pier.
     
            It can only be safely operated in conditions with a maximum of 3-foot waves and winds less than approximately 15 miles per hour, according to a 2006 Naval War College paper on the systems limitations. A prediction of sea conditions from  Israel’s Marine Data Center  shows waves are often at or near that 3-foot limit in the area.
     
            “JLOTS operations, which must take both safety and throughput requirements into account, must often wait for favorable weather and sea state conditions,” the authors wrote.
     
            A defense official confirmed to CNN that the limitations on the pier system are accurate.
     
            “The bottom line – heavy seas do have an effect on the ability to execute the JLOTS mission,” the official said. If winds or waves are stronger, loading and unloading using the JLOTS pier becomes dangerous.
     
            Another potentially complicating factor is how Israel decides to proceed with its operation in Rafah, in southern Gaza, US officials said. A major Israeli offensive there could raise additional security concerns and impact the timing of when the pier and causeway are staged in the eastern Mediterranean. The planned staging area for the aid once it reaches Gaza has been hit by mortar and rocket fire at least twice in the last several weeks, CNN has reported.
     
            The US is still aiming to move the system into place and begin the operation “in the coming days,” a Pentagon spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. For now, a massive barge called the M/V Sagamore that will be used to deliver the initial pallets of humanitarian aid from Cyprus to the pier has begun to move the supplies to another ship currently off the coast of Gaza, called the M/V Roy P. Benavidez.
     
            The Benavidez, contracted by the US military, has been in the eastern Mediterranean since last month supporting the maritime corridor effort.
     
            The US is also still working to finalize plans about who will actually transport humanitarian aid from the pier to the shore in Gaza, according to multiple US officials familiar with the matter.
     
            The UK had initially offered to provide personnel to help drive aid trucks from the US military-built causeway off the coast of Gaza to the shore, where it would be picked up by UN personnel overseen by the World Food Programme, officials said. But the British recently withdrew that offer amid security concerns, the sources said.
     
            The US, meanwhile, has ruled out using its own troops to drive the aid to the beach, because the Biden administration does not want American personnel getting that close to Gaza, officials have said.
     
            A UK government spokesperson said that the UK does not “currently have plans to deploy Armed Forces personnel onto Gazan soil as part of this initiative, but we are working closely with the US, Cyprus, and other allies to ensure aid can be quickly delivered over the pier once it is fully installed.”
     
            Another diplomatic source familiar with the discussions confirmed that there had been conversations in which the UK had offered to drive the aid down the causeway to the pier, as part of “a host of contingency plans” that had been developed.
     
            “But for now there are no plans for the UK to be involved in that way,” the source added “The most likely scenario is an as yet undecided third party.”
     
            Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters on Thursday that “non-US civilian contractors will be driving those vehicles on the causeway onto the beach.”
     
            One plan being discussed is for Israeli contractors to transport the aid, the officials and another source familiar with the matter told CNN. But that could also change and is not finalized, despite the Pentagon predicting that the pier will be up and running in the next several days.
     
            The Israel Defense Forces have agreed to provide a wide security perimeter around the pier system and the aid operation. That has made some humanitarian groups and UN officials uneasy given the IDF’s history of targeting aid convoys and the perception that they are working under the IDF’s control, CNN previously reported. But the plan is for the IDF to remain at a relative distance as the aid is transported and offloaded onto the beach in Gaza, officials told CNN.",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/09/politics/us-gaza-pier-obstacles/index.html,CNN,US facing obstacles getting aid delivered to Gaza after finishing pier construction,1
106,Politics,"As  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  sustains his support in public polls and makes steady progress on gaining ballot access in states across the country, his independent presidential bid is confounding the campaign of former President Donald Trump and its Republican allies.
     
            In recent weeks, Kennedy has gone from a perceived nuisance to a political problem that the Trump campaign is eager to swiftly extinguish, according to conversations with multiple people close to the former president.
     
            Trump himself has noticeably escalated his attacks on Kennedy in recent weeks, including  posting a lengthy video  to social media on Thursday that labeled him as a “Democrat plant” who will pull votes away from his campaign to help President Joe Biden, and urged Republicans not to cast a “wasted protest vote.”
     
            The shift comes as  recent polls  show that Kennedy could cut into Trump’s support just as much as he could draw votes away from Biden, with the results serving as an apparent warning for Republicans who have dismissed the independent candidate thus far, the sources say.
     
            The consensus held by Trump’s top advisers and allies had long been that Biden has more to lose from the presence of independents, and Kennedy specifically, in November. But the former president’s team has taken notice of Kennedy’s standing in some state polls and uptick in media attention, including regular appearances on conservative networks like Newsmax and Fox News, during which he’s openly courted anti-establishment voters. That’s sparked a more concerted effort from Republicans to try and prevent Kennedy from eating into any pro-Trump support.
     
            Trump’s advisers and those close to the former president told CNN they still view Kennedy as likely hurting Biden more. However, they privately acknowledge that his impact on Trump’s candidacy varies on a state-by-state basis. They also dismiss the notion that he could be perceived as a serious threat to the former president, but they argue their increased attacks against Kennedy are more an effort to halt any consideration from current or potential Trump supporters from casting their vote for the independent candidate.
     
            “RFK is a problem, not a threat,” one senior Trump adviser told CNN, who singled out Pennsylvania as one critical battleground state where Kennedy could hurt Trump, arguing voters in the Keystone State may be drawn more to a candidate who is neither Trump nor Biden.
     
            As CNN previously reported, there are some in Trump’s orbit who are concerned about Kennedy qualifying for the presidential debates and believe that having earlier debates would make it easier to keep Kennedy off the stage before he could gather further momentum in the polls.
     
            “It’s not that he’s a threat. A lot of it depends on the state, and it’s still not clear who he’s taking more from,” a person close to Trump said. “If we can make people on the right, who might be open minded to him, hate him very easily because he’s so liberal. Why not weigh him down as much as possible with conservative or conservative leaning voters?”
     
            CNN has reached out to Kennedy’s campaign for comment.
     
            Trump’s team  created a playbook months ago  to go on offense against Kennedy and define him as a “liberal parading in conservative’s clothing,” as one senior Trump adviser described him to CNN, pointing to a series of his policies on climate change and abortion to paint him as part of the progressive wing of the Democratic party.
     
            But in the months since, the messaging has varied. While Trump’s team and Republican National Committee officials stuck to the script and painted Kennedy as a far-left Democrat who doesn’t embody conservative values, the former president himself often had a different take.
     
            At a campaign stop at a Harlem bodega during Trump’s criminal trial last month, the former president ignored questions about whether he would consider Kennedy as a potential running mate, after Kennedy suggested emissaries of Trump’s had reached out about the prospect — something Trump’s campaign adamantly denied. Trump instead offered mild praise of Kennedy.
     
            Days later, he called Kennedy “a nice guy” during an interview with Real America’s Voice, adding he wasn’t sure whether Kennedy hurt him or Biden more.
     
            “Well, I think he’s a nice guy. I’ve known him. He’s extremely liberal. He’s more liberal than anybody,” Trump told the radio host. “They say he hurts Biden, I think, I’m not sure that that’s true. But he might hurt Biden a little bit more, you don’t know.”
     
            Flash forward to May, and Trump has adopted a more aggressive stance toward his independent rival. He has repeatedly attacked Kennedy on Truth Social, including  labeling him  as “a Radical Left Lunatic” and calling him “the dumbest member of the Kennedy Clan,” as well as needling Kennedy’s positions on vaccines and environmental policy, among others.
     
            Asked about Trump ratcheting up his attacks, a Trump campaign adviser told CNN: “We’ve seen an uptick in the amount of coverage he’s getting. And you know, we just want to reiterate our message. We want Trump to do what he does, what he does with everyone else. He separates the person from the politician.”

107,Politics,"Supreme Court Justice  Clarence Thomas  repeatedly pushed back on his critics during remarks Friday at a judicial conference in Alabama, lamenting what he described as the “nastiness” and “lies” directed at him and calling Washington a “hideous place.”
     
            Asked whether his jurisprudence required a degree of courage, Thomas said he didn’t view himself as courageous – particularly when compared with servicemembers, and firefighters and people who defuse bombs. Thomas said he was simply doing his job.
     
            “Being in Washington, you have to get used to particularly people who are reckless,” Thomas, a conservative and the court’s most senior associate justice, said. “They don’t bomb you, necessarily, but they bomb your reputation or your good name or your honor. And that’s not a crime but they can do as much harm that way.”
     
            Speaking at the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals conference in Point Clear, Alabama, Thomas argued that it would be a disservice to those soldiers and first responders “not to sit at my desk and make decisions with a lifetime appointment that we know are the right decisions.”
     
            Thomas, while not speaking directly to a  series of reports about ethics  that have plagued him for months, repeatedly returned to his critics without prompting from US District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, who moderated the discussion.
     
            “My wife and I, the last two or three years, it’s been – just the nastiness and the lies – it’s just incredible,” Thomas said.

       Judges from around the country say Trump can be held accountable for January 6. What will the Supreme Court say? 
     
            Thomas and his wife, Ginni, have been the target of a good deal of criticism in recent years. Several of Thomas’ critics, including Democratic members of Congress, have  called on him to recuse himself  from Supreme Court cases involving the  January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol  because of his wife’s efforts to reverse the 2020 presidential election in former President Donald Trump’s favor.
     
            Ginni Thomas has  acknowledged attending Trump’s rally  before the Capitol attack. Justice Thomas has  declined to recuse himself  from cases this year involving the January 6 attack, including a blockbuster appeal regarding Trump’s claims of absolute immunity from criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the election results.
     
            Thomas has also faced criticism for accepting private jet travel and posh vacations from Republican megadonor Harlan Crow, first reported by  ProPublica . In response to the blowback, Thomas  updated his financial disclosure forms , and the Supreme Court  adopted a code of conduct  for the first time last year.
     
            At one point on Friday, Thomas told a story about a walk he took with a friend before breaking off into an aside.
     
            “That’s before they started attacking my friends,” Thomas said. “I hope I still have some.”
     
            As he has in the past, Thomas also spared little criticism for Washington, DC.
     
            “I think what you’re gonna find, and especially in Washington, [is] people pride themselves in being awful,” Thomas said one point.
     
            The remark elicited laughter in the room, until Thomas continued.
     
            “It is a hideous place, as far as I’m concerned,” Thomas said, noting that he liked to visit other places where people “don’t pride themselves in doing harmful things merely because they have the capacity to do it.”
     
            Thomas, 75, also appeared to lament a  loss of trust within the Supreme Court , telling the conference that the  stunning leak of a draft abortion opinion in 2022  wouldn’t have happened when he joined the court in 1991. It wasn’t the first time Thomas has made those points – he once likened the leak to an “infidelity” – but his remarks Friday suggested the fallout from the leak of the decision overturning Roe v. Wade may still be top of mind.
     
      
       Related article 
       Justice Clarence Thomas chooses not to recuse himself from another January 6-related case 
     
            “We may have been a dysfunctional family, but we were a family,” Thomas said of the court when he first joined in 1991. “It would be inconceivable that anyone would leak an opinion of the court or do anything to intentionally harm one another.”
     
            Thomas also became the latest justice in recent weeks to raise concern with the Supreme Court’s applications docket, the process the court uses to handle emergency requests. That docket has come under fierce criticism in recent years, in part because the court often decides the requests on a short timeline, usually without oral argument and often with orders that do not indicate how the justices voted.
     
            “I think there’s some concern about that among my colleagues – certainly with me – because it short circuits our process,” Thomas said. “The way that we’re doing it now, I think, is not a thorough way of dealing with very, very difficult issues.”
     
            As he returned to his critics, Thomas suggested the lesson he had taken away from the last year of controversy was that he would not react with “nastiness for nastiness.”
     
            “You have some choices. You don’t get to prevent people from doing horrible things or saying horrible things,” Thomas said.
     
            But, he said, he had come to accept “the fact that they can’t change you unless you permit that.”

108,Politics,"Judge Juan Merchan called out former President Donald Trump’s defense team during their motion for a mistrial Thursday afternoon, telling them there were many times they could have objected to Stormy Daniels’ testimony, but did not.
     
            For the second time this week, Merchan expressed surprise that Trump’s lawyers had not objected more when Daniels was on the stand. And for the second time this week, Merchan rejected their motion for a mistrial.
     
            Trump attorney Todd Blanche argued Daniels’ changed her story by suggesting that this “completely made-up encounter with President Trump may not have been consensual” and said the defense did not know those questions were coming, hearing them for the first time on Tuesday.
     
            The judge responded to their arguments saying, “For some unexplained reason that I still don’t understand” there was no objection to certain testimony cited in the motion for a mistrial and again today.
     
            Merchan specifically pointed to Daniels’ testimony about the trailer park, in which Daniels suggested Trump told her she would be stuck living in a trailer park before they had sex in 2006. The judge said he felt that was unnecessary and he objected himself.
     
            Another example listed by Merchan was the testimony about Trump not wearing a condom. Merchan said he was surprised attorney Susan Necheles did not object.
     
            “Why on earth she (Necheles) wouldn’t object to the mention of a condom I don’t understand,” Merchan said.
     
            Daniels testified on Tuesday that Trump did not wear a condom when they had sex and described telling Trump during their conversation at the hotel dining room table her sexual partners during filming of her movies always wore a condom.
     
            Merchan also referred back to the defense’s opening statement when Blanche denied there was ever a sexual encounter between Daniels and Trump. The judge said that assertion opened the door for the prosecution to make an effort to show her story was credible to prove their case, allowing them to ask more detailed questions about the encounter.
     
            “The more specificity Ms. Daniels can provide about the encounter, the more the jury can weigh whether the encounter did occur and if so whether they choose to credit Ms. Daniels’ story,” Merchan said.

109,Politics,"The Office of Congressional Ethics, a nonpartisan Capitol Hill watchdog, said there is “probable cause” to believe GOP Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas misused campaign funds for personal use – which he denies.
     
            The OCE’s December report was released Friday by the House Ethics Committee, which is  still reviewing  whether to take up the case.
     
            OCE looked into thousands of dollars in rent payments that Nehls’ campaign made to an LLC that is registered under the congressman’s name and listed at his home address. His campaign headquarters, however, is listed at a different address, according to the report, which raises questions about whether the payments are “legitimate” campaign expenses.
     
            The report also said Nehls may have omitted information from his annual financial disclosure statements.
     
            The OCE report noted that Nehls refused to cooperate with the office’s probe, but the congressman has previously said he would cooperate with the House Ethics Committee, which is a bipartisan panel.
     
            A January  statement  from Jerad Najvar, an attorney for Nehls, was released alongside the OCE report denying the allegations and saying the rent payments were legitimate campaign expenses.

110,Politics,"The US is trying to negotiate an agreement with the  military junta that took over Niger  last July to leave behind a small contingent of US forces, even as a broad withdrawal order has been issued to enable the departure of the majority of the less than 1,000 US troops in the West African nation, according to US officials.
     
            While some US officials have started conversations with Niger about what the withdrawal will look like, the civilian head of US special operations told CNN this week that the Pentagon has yet to have more detailed conversations with Niger, which will largely focus more on logistics of the withdrawal.
     
            Officials said a US delegation will travel to Niger over the weekend to discuss how it will be carried out.
     
            “We’ll make the most out of the situation that was presented to us but the intent is in Niger, to draw down to a level that the Nigerians can live with,” Chris Maier, assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict, told CNN.
     
            “Niger is pretty profound in the decision of the government there … to have us depart or at least go to very low numbers,” Maier said.
     
            Among the issues defense officials must resolve in their meetings with Niger’s government is an agreement to allow US military flights in and out of the country. Since the coup in July, airspace has been closed over Niger to foreign militaries who have all had to submit individual requests for airspace to conduct military flights, one US official told CNN.
     
            A US military official explained that the withdrawal will come in phases over a period of months. The phase currently happening is the breakdown of anything not necessary for life or safety and security, which is being prepped to be taken out of the country. The footprint will continue to shrink in phases as equipment and personnel not deemed necessary are moved out of country.
     
            The official also said that the hope of having a small number of troops remaining in the country is largely wishful thinking at this point despite the conversations still ongoing, as Niger’s government has been clear it wants US forces out.
     
            US officials said the volatile situation in Niger is just the latest signal of growing instability on the continent of Africa, where a wave of military coups over the last several years has imperiled the American presence there and offered an opportunity for Russia to grow its influence. The US military footprint in Africa is relatively small and nominally is focused on counterterrorism efforts, but officials also believe that Africa is key in the global battle for influence between Russia and the United States.
     
            Niger’s military government  ended  its military agreement with the US in March, and  for several months now  Russian forces have been operating in different camps of the same base housing US troops.
     
            In addition to Niger’s expulsion of US forces, Chad has threatened to cancel its status of forces agreement with the US, further destabilizing the US’ presence on the continent. Although the small number of US troops in Chad makes it a less obvious military loss, a third US official said that it could be a bellwether for stability — and American influence — across the continent.
     
            Gen. Michael Langley, the head of US Africa Command,  told Congress in March  that a “number of countries” in Africa were “at the tipping point of actually being captured by the Russian Federation as they are spreading some of their false narratives.” Maier echoed the same, saying Russia and China have “invested a lot more than we have” in information operations, which helps spread their influence.
     
            American officials said it is difficult for the US to compete directly with what Russia is willing to offer some of the military leaders that have taken over governments in Africa. Russia can offer immediate security assistance — including weapons — in the fight against terrorism, assistance that comes with far fewer conditions than American aid.
     
            “My concern among others is that the partnership that we rely on fundamentally to, we hope, help these countries is not there anymore, or they’ve replaced it in some instances with the elixir of Russia that promises things that are more rapid that might be what some of these governments, especially the coup governments, think they need in the short term,” Maier said.
     
            The fear, according to the second US official, is that growing instability could create a swath of nations across Africa where the US can’t operate safely but Russia potentially can. That could have dramatic security implications beyond Africa, particularly if it imperils safe US access to the Mediterranean where the US military has been operating since Hamas’ invasion of Israel in October.
     
            When it comes to Africa, the US “may be in a situation where we’re increasingly on the outside looking in,” Maier said. But he added that it could present an opportunity to show the ineffectiveness of Russia’s offers to African nations.
     
            “Now some of these coup regimes have decided that they are going to go with the Russians, so now they’re the dog that caught the car,” he said. “And if there aren’t results — not only security space, but a lot of the other things that are part of governance — then the facts will start to outstrip even the most sophisticated mis and disinformation over time.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/us-niger-forces-talks/index.html,CNN,"US hopes to maintain some forces in Niger as talks on withdrawal continue, officials say",1
111,Politics,"Rep. Henry Cuellar’s former campaign manager and another political operative have agreed to plead guilty to federal crimes and are cooperating with  the Justice Department’s prosecution of the Texas Democrat , according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.
     
            Mina Colin Strother, Cuellar’s former campaign manager and former chief of staff, and Florencio “Lencho” Rendon, a political consultant and businessman from San Antonio, agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering in March.
     
            Cuellar and his wife, Imelda, were indicted last week on suspicion of accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from two foreign entities – a bank headquartered in Mexico City and an oil and gas company owned by the government of Azerbaijan.
     
            Both the congressman and his wife have pleaded not guilty. Cuellar has publicly asserted his innocence, saying in a statement last week that “both my wife and I are innocent of these allegations. Everything I have done in Congress has been to serve the people of South Texas.”
     
            According to court documents, Rendon and Cuellar concocted the bribery scheme in 2015 after learning that the Mexican bank needed help doing business within the United States. Rendon signed on to a phony “consulting agreement” with the bank for $15,000 per month, prosecutors say.
     
            Most of the money was eventually sent to the Cuellars, prosecutors allege, but Rendon didn’t think it was a good idea to send money directly to Imelda.
     
            Cuellar then suggested recruiting Strother as a middleman, prosecutors say. The alleged plot evolved into an arrangement where Rendon would send $11,000 per month to Strother, who in turn would send $10,000 to a company owned by Imelda Cuellar, according to court documents.
     
            From March 2016 to February 2018, Strother transferred nearly $215,000 to Cuellar’s wife, according to court filings.
     
            The Cuellars are not named in Strother’s and Rendon’s plea deal agreements, but both of their case numbers are listed as related cases to Cuellar’s in court records. Specific details laid out in the plea agreements also exactly match details in the indictment against Cuellar.
     
            Cuellar’s attorney, Chris Flood, told CNN in a statement, “As long as Strother and Rendon tell the truth, we are not worried. As we all know, the government can convince people to tell them what they want to hear rather than the truth. I don’t know what they are saying, but as long as they stick to the truth, we are not worried.”
     
            CNN has reached out to attorneys for Rendon and Strother for comment.

112,Politics,"The US announced on Friday a new $400 million military aid package to  Ukraine .
     
            The package includes weapons Ukraine has been asking for, including Patriot missile system munitions, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMAR) systems and ammunition, Stinger anti-air missiles, 155mm artillery rounds, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAPs), among other equipment.
     
            “As President Biden has made clear, the United States and the international coalition we have assembled will continue to stand with Ukraine in its defense of its freedom,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.
     
            The announcement marks the second Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) package since President Joe Biden signed a long-delayed national security supplemental securing $60 billion in funding for Ukraine.
     
            Last month, just moments after Biden signed the legislation, the US announced a $1 billion PDA package to Ukraine. Biden  said at the time  that shipments of the equipment to Ukraine would begin “in the next few hours.” And just two days later, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a  historic $6 billion  long-term investment package to purchase new equipment for Ukraine.
     
            The $6 billion package — the largest the US has announced — is under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI). USAI is different from than the PDA package in that it contracts with the US defense industry to purchase new equipment, whereas PDAs pull equipment from existing US stocks.
     
            While some equipment under the PDA can arrive within days of the announcement, support under USAI takes longer; Austin said at the time that the Pentagon was “going to move as fast as we can to get them the capability as fast as industry can produce.”
     
            On Friday, the State Department also announced the $30 million sale of HIMARS to Ukraine, a rocket launcher that Kyiv’s military has used to great effect against Russian forces. The emergency sale, which includes three of the HIMARS vehicles, will be paid for by Germany on behalf of Ukraine.
     
            But  officials have told CNN  that Russia is seeking to exploit that lag time and step up its attacks on Ukraine as the embattled country waits for assistance to arrive. The lag in those shipments is made more severe given the months-long delay in aid as Congress debated the supplemental legislation.
     
            On Wednesday evening, Ukrainian authorities said Russia launched dozens of missiles and drones on Ukraine, targeting energy infrastructure. On Friday, a Ukrainian military source told CNN that Russian forces had penetrated at least one kilometer inside northern Ukraine in an assault on a border town on Thursday evening.
     
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that Russia “launched a new wave of counteroffensive actions in ([northern Kharkiv region). Ukraine met them there with our troops, brigades and artillery.”
     
            “But our military and military command were aware of this and anticipated their forces to meet the enemy with fire,” he said. “Now there is a fierce battle in this area. … I think as of now we have stopped the enemy with artillery fire.”

113,Sports,"History can weigh heavy on some. Attempting to forge a path never trodden, trying to be the first can become too burdensome a task for even the greats. The expectation, the pressure increasing with each step made towards that never-before-achieved feat.
     
            Yet two rounds, or 36 holes, away from possibly making history,  Nelly Korda  is an athlete who seems at ease with what could lie ahead.
     
            “Did a really good job of staying present and just staying in my own little bubble,” she told reporters after her second round at the Cognizant Founders Cup, before laughing at how those words could be a drinking game so often does she say them.
     
            It is the bubble which helps explain how the American was able to produce such a stunning bogey-free performance in difficult conditions in Clifton, New Jersey, to put herself back in contention for what would be a record-breaking sixth straight LPGA Tour title.
     
            Korda, the world No.1, was six shots off the lead after her first round. Her six-under-par 66 in the second round was just one of three bogey-free rounds on a wet and windy day and moved her to third on the leaderboard, four shots behind Madelene Sagstrom and Rose Zhang who share the overnight lead.
     
            At last month’s The Chevron Championship, Korda won her fifth consecutive title to join   Annika Sörenstam  and Nancy Lopez as the only players to win five in a row on the tour.
     
            Should the 25-year-old secure a remarkable sixth title in as many outings it would be one of the greatest achievements in sport. Not only can she claim to being the best female golfer in the world, but it could also strongly be argued that she is currently the best athlete on this planet. Certainly, few have been as dominant in their chosen field.
     
            “Everything is about staying very in the moment, staying very present in these kind of conditions, especially on this golf course,” she added after round two.
     
            The 13-time LPGA Tour winner, who last lost in January, has unsurprisingly been the focus of attention leading up to this tournament and her celebrity is in the ascendancy, as her attendance at the Met Gala this week testified.
     
            She told ESPN ahead of the tournament that her busy schedule meant she had not had time to think about being on the cusp of history.
     
            Again, in that interview she emphasized she would stay in the moment, take it “a shot at a time,” but also admitted recent successes had taken their toll.
     
            She opted out of competing at the JM Eagle LA Championship last month because she was exhausted.
     
            “I just felt like mentally, I just needed the rest,” Korda told ESPN. “I was just so mentally tired going through all those situations and high-pressure moments.”
     
            Refreshed and back playing, Korda has put herself in a strong position on a course in which she didn’t make the cut last year.
     
            According to the LPGA, she has only led once at the halfway mark in her previous five victories of 2024 so she is more than capable of overhauling Sagstrom and Zhang.
     
            The question is: if history looms ever closer in those closing stages, can “the bubble” protect her from the weight of trying to achieve what no one else ever has?",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/11/sport/nelly-korda-cognizant-founders-cup-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,,2

            According to Doug Wittman, Long Beach Little League president, Burroughs was found unresponsive next to his vehicle at the Long Beach complex after dropping his son off for a game Thursday, The Sun reported.
     
            “I have had the privilege of coaching with Sean for the past two years,” Wittman said on Instagram, and Burroughs “always came with a fun and friendly attitude the kids were drawn to, a wealth of baseball knowledge that could get any kid out of a batting rut and humility worth emulating. To say this is a huge loss is an understatement.”
     
            Burroughs won two consecutive Little League World Series titles in 1992 and 1993 for Long Beach. At 12 years old, he appeared on “The Late Show with David Letterman” after the second championship. Burroughs would later return to the team to coach his son.
     
            Burroughs also won a gold medal in baseball with Team USA at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, after the US defeated heavily favored Cuba in the final. It was the first-ever Olympic gold medal for the baseball program.

            Drafted with the ninth overall pick in the 1998 MLB Draft by the San Diego Padres, Burroughs would play seven MLB seasons with the Padres, the Tampa Bay Rays – then known as the Devil Rays – Arizona Diamondbacks and Minnesota Twins, finishing with a career .278 batting average, 12 home runs and 143 runs batted in.
     
            “We mourn the passing of former Padres third baseman Sean Burroughs,” the Padres  said  on X Friday. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this very difficult time.”
     
            The Diamondbacks  added : “The #Dbacks mourn the passing of Sean Burroughs and offer our condolences to his family and friends. Sean was a member of the 2011 NL West champion team and beloved by his teammates, coaches, staff, and fans. Rest in peace, Sean.”

115,Sports,"Former  NBA  champion Glen Davis has been sentenced to 40 months in prison for his part in a scheme to defraud the league’s health care plan out of millions of dollars, according to federal court records from the Southern District of New York.
     
            Davis, 38, was one of 18 former NBA players who were  indicted  in October 2021 after allegedly participating in a “widespread scheme to defraud” the NBA’s health plan by submitting nearly $4 million in “false and fraudulent” claims to be reimbursed for medical and dental services that had not actually been provided.
     
            Davis – whose nickname while he played in the NBA was “Big Baby” – was also ordered to pay $80,000 in restitution, according to court documents.
     
            In November, Davis was found guilty of wire fraud, health care fraud, conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to make false statements related to health care matters, court documents show.
     
            When approached for comment by CNN, Davis’ attorney noted his intent to appeal but declined to comment further.
     
            Former NBA player Terrence Williams was also convicted in the case, court documents show.
     
            Williams, who has been called the “leader of the conspiracy” by prosecutors, pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud in 2022, according to a judgment order. He received a 10-year prison sentence and three years of supervised release in August 2023.
     
            In addition to his prison term, Williams was to forfeit $653,672 and to pay restitution in the amount of $2,500,000, court documents show.
     
            Williams’ attorney did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
     
            CNN has reached out to the NBA for comment.
     
            Davis was selected by the Seattle Supersonics – which have since moved and have been rebranded as the Oklahoma City Thunder – with the 35th pick of the 2007 NBA Draft before having his rights traded to the Boston Celtics, playing in the NBA for eight seasons. He was part of the Celtics’ NBA title-winning team in 2008, while also going on to play for the Orlando Magic and the Los Angeles Clippers.
     
            He averaged eight points and 4.4 rebounds per game during his NBA career.
     
            A total of 16 people were arrested by the FBI following the 2021 indictment by Manhattan federal prosecutors.
     
            In 2021, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time, Audrey Strauss, said the ringleader Williams allegedly obtained fraudulent medical and dental invoices, sent those invoices to his co-conspirators, who then submitted the claims to the plan, which paid “most” of their claims for procedures they never received.
     
            The scheme, Strauss said, began around November 2017.
     
            Each person allegedly tried to claim between $65,000 to as much as $420,000 in fraudulent medical service reimbursements, Strauss said. She said in many cases, the people submitting the invoices were nowhere near the location where they claimed to be receiving treatments.
     
            One former NBA player, Strauss said, submitted a bill for $48,000 claiming he had IV sedation and root canals and crowns on eight teeth on December 20, 2018, at an office in Beverly Hills, California.

            “The decision (to appear at the French Open) as you can imagine, is not clear in my mind today,” the 22-time grand slam winner said afterwards, according to the ATP Tour.
     
            “But if I have to say what’s my feeling and if my mind is closer one way or the other way, I’m going to say I will be in Roland Garros and try my best.”
     
            Nadal succumbed to a 6-1 6-3 defeat against world No. 9 Hurkacz in Rome, in what was likely his last appearance at a tournament he has won a record 10 times. He is still struggling with the injuries that have derailed his comeback after undergoing hip surgery last season.
     
            He said last May that 2024 will likely be his last year on tour, and so the upcoming French Open represents possibly his last chance to play at a tournament with which he will forever be associated, and which he dominated during his heyday.
     
            The 37-year-old Spaniard accumulated a record 14 titles at Roland Garros, the most recent coming in 2022, but he was forced to withdraw last year due to injury before the tournament began, missing it for the first time since he made his debut in 2005.
     
            Nadal told reporters on Saturday that there were two ways for him to approach this year’s French Open.
     
            “Probably one is to say, ‘Okay, I am not ready, I am not playing well enough.’ Then is the moment to take a decision in terms of not playing Roland Garros. Another is to accept how I am today and work the proper way to try to be in a different way in two weeks,” he said, according to the ATP.
     
            “Physically I have some issues, but not probably yet enough to say not playing in the most important event of my tennis career.
     
            “Let’s see what’s going on, how I feel myself mentally tomorrow, after tomorrow, and in one week. If I feel ready, I’m going to try to be there and fight for the things that I have been fighting the last 15 years, even if now it seems impossible.”",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/11/sport/rafael-nadal-french-open-italian-open-spt-intl/index.html,CNN,,2

120,Business,"A Panera Bread spokesperson says the restaurant chain is phasing out its Charged Lemonade, a highly caffeinated beverage that has been blamed for at least two deaths in lawsuits. The beverages prompted controversy in October following a lawsuit filed by the family of 21-year-old   a University of Pennsylvania student with a heart condition who died after consuming Charged Lemonade. A second lawsuit was filed in December by the family of  , a Florida man with a chromosomal deficiency disorder and a developmental delay who also died after drinking a Charged Lemonade. A third lawsuit was filed in January by Lauren Skerritt, a 28-year-old  , which claimed the beverage left her with “permanent cardiac injuries.” A spokesperson for Panera said Tuesday that the nationwide discontinuation of the Charged Lemonade comes after a “recent menu transformation.”  “We listened to more than 30,000 guests about what they wanted from Panera, and are focusing next on the broad array of beverages we know our guests desire — ranging from exciting, on-trend flavors, to low sugar and low-caffeine options,” the spokesperson said.  Panera declined to say when the Charged Lemonade would be completely removed from menus. Sarah Katz's mother, Jill Katz, said Wednesday that she was relieved that the chain had decided to discontinue the drink.   ""It's a good thing,"" Katz said in a phone interview. ""But I'm sad, because I wish they came to this conclusion before they put this product on the market."" Panera   as “Plant-based and Clean with as much caffeine as our Dark Roast coffee.” But the lawsuits said that at 390 milligrams, a large, 30-fluid-ounce Charged Lemonade has more caffeine in total than any size of Panera’s dark roast coffee, referring to the amount of caffeine that is in the drink with no ice. Panera has since updated its   to reflect how much caffeine is in the Charged Lemonade with ice, listing the large size of the blood orange Charged Lemonade, for example, as having 302 milligrams. According to the  , healthy adults can generally safely consume 400 milligrams of caffeine a day.  After NBC News broke news last year of the Katz family's lawsuit, which referred to Charged Lemonade as “a dangerous energy drink,” Panera put more detailed disclosures in all of its restaurants and on its website warning customers to consume Charged Lemonade in moderation,   for children, people sensitive to caffeine or pregnant or nursing women.  Sarah Katz's mother Jill said her daughter avoided all energy drinks because of her heart condition, long QT syndrome, which she was diagnosed with as a young child. Jill Katz said that there was ""no way that she had any clue"" that the Charged Lemonade had so much caffeine. Panera has previously expressed sympathy for the Katz and the Brown families.  , it said in a statement that it felt the customer’s “unfortunate passing was not caused by one of the company’s products” and said that it stands by the safety of the items on its menu. The restaurant chain did not comment on the third lawsuit.  On Monday evening, two Panera employees who spoke to NBC News on condition of anonymity because they feared they could lose their jobs confirmed that they had received memos earlier in the day from staff above them stating that their restaurants would no longer be ordering ingredients to make Charged Lemonade.  The memos, which were shared with NBC News, came from a manager in one case and a regional manager in another case, the employees said. One memo said the Charged Lemonade would be replaced within two weeks. The first employee identified himself as an associate at a Panera restaurant in Missouri, while the other said she was a manager at a Panera in Pennsylvania.  But not all Panera employees were immediately aware of the change. At a Panera restaurant in the Queens borough of New York City on Tuesday morning, three associates said they had not heard that the Charged Lemonade would be discontinued.  Elizabeth Crawford, a partner at the Philadelphia-based law firm Kline & Specter, PC, who represents the plaintiffs in the three lawsuits, said Tuesday that Panera had taken a “good step.”  “This is exactly what we set out to do, to some extent, is to make sure that this poison is taken off the shelves,” she said in an exclusive interview. “Obviously, it won’t bring back Sarah, and it won’t bring back Dennis, and the life that Lauren used to have.”  “But at least what it will do is prevent this from happening to someone else,” she said.

As   their restaurant spending, Applebee’s and IHOP are fighting against a larger group of rivals than usual for a smaller pool of customers. Dine Brands CEO John Peyton said full-service restaurants, fast-food chains and even eating at home are all competing for diners’ dollars. To rise above the competition, Applebee’s has been leaning into value with a slate of promotions that includes the return of Dollaritas, which makes Peyton confident that it can beat out the fast-food chains vying for its customers. “The Whole Lotta Burger for $9.99 — if you can have our burger for $10, which is great quality, abundant and eat in our restaurant, in our experience, why would you eat a $10 burger out of a paper bag in your car?” he told CNBC. Low-income consumers visited less frequently and spent more carefully when they did eat out in the first quarter, according to Peyton. Consumers with incomes under $50,000 account for about 40% to 50% of Dine’s customers, he said. Dine Brands reported first-quarter   that fell short of Wall Street’s estimates, and both Applebee’s and IHOP’s   more than expected. Still, Dine reiterated its full-year outlook and said sales have improved sequentially. Shares of the company closed roughly flat. But it’s too soon to tell if Dine will succeed in winning over diners — and investors.

Besides leaning into deals, Applebee’s might also get an edge on the competition from a triad of recent pop-culture moments: a pivotal cameo in the tennis drama film “Challengers,” an Applebee’s-motivated meltdown on “Survivor” and a shoutout from football legend Peyton Manning during Netflix’s roast of his former rival Tom Brady.

That effort, which   between venues in Texas and Washington, D.C., for weeks, is now about to reach a milestone: a judge in the Northern District of Texas is expected to announce by Friday evening whether the court will grant the industry’s request for a freeze. That could hold up the regulation, which would   what most banks can charge in late fees to $8 per incident, just days before it was to   on Tuesday. “We should get some clarity soon about whether the rule is going to be allowed to go into effect,” said  , lead policy analyst at Wolfe Research. The credit card regulation is part of President   broader election-year war against what he deems  . Big card issuers have steadily raised the cost of late fees since 2010, profiting off users with low credit scores who   $138 in fees annually per card on average,  to CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. As expected, the industry has mounted a campaign to derail the regulations, deeming them a misguided effort that   costs to those who pay their bills on time, and ultimately harms those it purports to benefit by making it more likely for users to fall behind.

The Justice Department said the law required the financing arm to obtain court permission before repossessing vehicles. It cited as an example the 2017 repossession and sale of Navy Airman Jessica Johnson’s three-year-old Hyundai Elantra, after the financing arm determined that she was on active duty but “not deployed.” Johnson still owed $13,796 on the car, and Hyundai Capital America realized in 2020 it should not have repossessed it, court papers show. “Members of our Armed Forces should not have to worry about having their cars repossessed while they are in military service,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.

125,Business,"Some customers of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX could receive the full value of the money they lost if a court approves the company's bankruptcy plan. However, they will not see the gains on their holdings of bitcoin and other digital assets that have occurred over the past two years, despite massive increases in the value of those financial instruments since the FTX exchange collapsed in November 2022. According to   filed Tuesday by FTX, which is going through reorganization, 98% of FTX creditors, including individual investors, who had $50,000 or less with the company will receive the funds they lost, in cash, within 60 days of a reorganization plan going into effect. The plan must still be approved by a court and by creditors.  “We are pleased to be in a position to propose a chapter 11 plan that contemplates the return of 100% of bankruptcy claim amounts plus interest for non-governmental creditors,"" said John J. Ray III, who took over as chief executive officer of FTX alongside his role as chief restructuring officer. That plan is possible mostly because FTX and its sister company, Alameda Research, held a number of other assets that the reorganization team has sold off. These included shares in Anthropic, the Amazon-backed artificial intelligence startup now valued at nearly $20 billion. FTX said it had sold shares in the company worth $900 million this year. But some claimants have objected to their crypto assets being valued at November 2022 prices as part of the bankruptcy. Since that date, the price of bitcoin has climbed more than 250%. In February, the Justice Department appointed an independent examiner, Robert Cleary, to review potential issues with parties involved in the bankruptcy, including past investigations into the FTX debtors and potential conflicts of interest in the FTX bankruptcy involving FTX’s law firm, Sullivan & Cromwell.

FTX acknowledged that some claimants might find the value of what's coming back to them through the bankruptcy to be insufficient.

126,Business,"LONDON — The Bank of England on Thursday announced a widely expected hold on interest rates as it said restrictive monetary policy was taming inflation, but warned a June rate cut was not a done deal. Members of the central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to hold, with the latter favoring a cut. In the prior meeting only one member voted for a cut. The MPC nonetheless cautioned that indicators of inflation persistence “remain elevated,” highlighting that services inflation came in at 6% in March, and that there are “upside risks” to the near-term outlook from geopolitics. It said it would monitor upcoming data releases closely. Two consumer price index prints are due before its next meeting on June 20. The decision keeps the BOE’s key Bank Rate at 5.25%. “We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates,” BOE Governor Andrew Bailey said in a statement reported by Reuters. “I’m optimistic that things are moving in the right direction.” Market anticipation has been building for interest rate cuts to begin in the summer, with money markets fully pricing in a 25 basis point reduction in August and 50 basis points overall this year. Some economists see a cut in June and three or more cuts in 2024, though market pricing suggested a 45% probability of that following the meeting. U.K. headline inflation is forecast to drop dramatically in April due to lower energy prices, from the   to below the BOE’s 2% target, according to some projections. In its Thursday release, the BOE said it expected it expected the U.K. gross domestic product to grow by 0.4% in the first quarter of the year, and by 0.2% in the second quarter. The economy   in the second half of 2023. It meanwhile sees headline inflation close to 2% in the near-term, and expects it to increase slightly later in the year as the drag from the energy market wanes. In a press conference following the announcement, Bailey emphasized the message in its statement that the MPC “will consider forthcoming data releases and how these inform the assessment that the risks from inflation persistence are receding.” “June is not a fait accompli, but each meeting is a new decision,” he said. Paul Dales, chief U.K. economist at Capital Economists, noted the BOE had repeated previous messaging on monetary policy remaining restrictive for “sufficiently long” and for “an extended period.” This “suggests to us that the Bank is not implying it will cut rates at the next policy meeting in June,” he said in a note. “But the new line that the MPC will ‘consider forthcoming data releases and how these inform the assessment that the risks from inflation persistence are receding’ implies that the MPC is willing to change its stance and that the data will determine when that happens.” Wage data may end up informing whether the cut falls in June or August, he added.

127,Business,"Mortgage rates are significantly higher than they were at the start of this year, but they pulled back slightly last week after several weeks of straight increases. That was enough to spark some new demand, especially for refinances. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($766,550 or less) decreased to 7.18% from 7.29%, with points unchanged at 0.65 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment. “Treasury rates and mortgage rates fell last week on the news of a slowing  , with wage growth at the slowest pace since 2021, and the  ’s announced plans to ease quantitative tightening in June and to maintain its view that another rate hike is unlikely,” said Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s senior vice president and chief economist. The rate for Federal Housing Administration loans fell below 7% for the first time in three weeks, which is a welcome sign for first-time buyers, who tend to use FHA loans. “First-time homebuyers account for roughly half of purchase loans, and the government lending programs are an important source of financing for these homebuyers. The gain in FHA activity is a sign that this segment of the market is active,” Fratantoni added. The dip in rates caused refinance demand to increase 5% for the week, although it was still 6% lower than the year-earlier week. Rates are 70 basis points higher than they were a year ago, so there are very few borrowers who can benefit from a refinance. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 2% for the week but were still 17% lower than the same week a year earlier. Affordability is hitting potential buyers hard, as   continue to climb.

The investor,  , had been on the board of directors of the publicly traded company,  , at the time he was accused of sharing and exploiting non-public information with others about its plans to merge with then-privately held Trump Media, the owner of the Truth Social app. Trump Media’s majority shareholder is former President  , who was not accused of any wrongdoing in the case against Garelick in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. But Garelick’s trial, which began on April 30, took place just blocks away from where Trump is on trial in Manhattan Supreme Court on criminal charges related to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Two co-defendants of Garelick, the brothers Michael and Gerald Shvartsman, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges on April 3. Jurors in Garelick’s case began deliberating on Wednesday afternoon after hearing closing arguments from prosecutors and a defense lawyer. After several hours of deliberation Thursday, jurors returned guilty verdicts on the five counts of securities fraud and conspiracy that the 54-year-old Garelick faced. Garelick, who testified at his trial, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 12. Garelick was an investment advisor to Michael Shvartsman’s venture capital firm, Rocket One Capital. Prosecutors said Garelick shared non-public material information about DWAC’s merger plans with Trump Media with the Shvartsman brothers in 2021 after joining DWAC’s board. All three men then bought up DWAC stock based on that non-public information and then sold their shares after the price soared following the announcement of the deal to combine with Trump Media, prosecutors said. Garelick made a profit of just $49,000 on the illicit trades, but the Shvartsmans earned a whopping $23 million, according to prosecutors. “Bruce Garelick was part of a sophisticated group of individuals invited to invest in Digital World Acquisition Corporation ..., a special purpose acquisition company that had raised funds with the intention of later investing in a target company, Trump Media & Technology Group, not yet known to the public,” said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a statement Thursday. “When he was given that opportunity, Garelick promised to keep the information about DWAC’s interest in acquiring Trump Media secret and not use it to trade in the stock market. Garelick was also given a seat on DWAC’s board, which gave him direct access to additional non-public information regarding the acquisition,” Williams said. “As a unanimous jury has just found, Garelick blatantly violated the law by using the information that he obtained as an insider at DWAC to trade and tip others,” the top prosecutor said. “Garelick’s federal conviction is yet another stark reminder that insider trading is always a losing bet.” DWAC and Trump Media completed their merger in late March.

Shareholders at  ,   and   will put on the ballot at the respective casino companies proposals to force them to study the costs associated with permitting smoking indoors — and whether going smoke-free could save money. The proposals are sponsored by Trinity Health, a nonprofit health care network, and the Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights Foundation. Trinity Health, based in Livonia, Michigan, has used its shareholder status to   despite the fact that it owns just a tiny fraction of these companies. For example, public records show Trinity owns just 440 shares of Bally’s stock, or about 0.001% of the company. Boyd, Bally’s and Caesars fought to keep the proposals out of the proxy materials distributed to shareholders. The Securities and Exchange Commission denied the casinos’ requests, and the proposals as well as the rationale behind them were delivered to all shareholders. Boyd will face a   at its annual shareholder meeting Thursday. Bally’s holds its annual meeting on May 16, and Caesars will follow with its own meeting, likely in June. The three companies collectively operate 75 U.S. casinos that permit indoor smoking, where state law allows. About 14 states permit indoor smoking in commercial casinos. States like Nevada and New Jersey have prohibited indoor smoking more broadly but carved out exceptions for casinos. Legislation to end indoor smoking at casinos is in various stages in several states across the country, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Advocates for smoking bans point to research by C3 Gaming that concluded smoke-free casinos generate more revenue and outperform competitors that allow smoking. Proposal sponsors argue shareholders should know how much casinos pay in higher health insurance premiums for employees, greater maintenance costs and keeping away customers who hate the smoke. In its proxy, Boyd argues it’s seen a negative impact in states that banned indoor smoking. It argues these decisions are best left up to the properties to follow local trends and says if shareholders succeed in implementing a ban (which Boyd claims is the true goal in forcing an assessment), the company will lose customers to competitors who continue to allow smoking. Caesars board member Jan Jones Blackhurst said Wednesday at the SBC Summit North America, an online gaming conference, that she believes the decision of whether to ban smoking in casinos should be left up to governments. She pointed out that experience has shown that smoke-free casinos can take an economic hit. “Generally, if you look across the United States, when casinos prohibit smoking, revenues fall anywhere from 20% to 25%, which also then have a huge layoff factor with people starting to lose their jobs,” she said. Unions are mixed in their responses. While some worry about the potential of job losses, the United Auto Workers, which represents more than 10,000 table game dealers across the country, has ramped up its efforts in the fight against in-casino smoking, citing secondhand exposure for employees. The   says “no amount of exposure to secondhand smoke is safe and the only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke is through 100% smoke free indoor air environments.” The U.S. surgeon general says that many common practices found in casinos such as separating smoking versus non-smoking sections, cleaning the air and ventilating buildings are not effective protections against secondhand smoke. Casino operator Parx, which runs locations in Pennsylvania, decided to stay smoke-free during the Covid pandemic at its property in Bensalem, north of Philadelphia. It competes with four other local casinos that allow smoking indoors but said it hasn’t seen its market share suffer. “Financially, we know we’ve lost some customers, but we also know we’ve gained some customers. We don’t think we’ve seen a significant impact either way,” Parx spokesperson Marc Oppenheimer told CNBC. Instead, the company said it focuses on guest satisfaction scores and surveys that indicate a boost to employee morale. In Las Vegas,   opened the first casino resort on the Strip to prohibit indoor smoking and even smoking on the pool deck. On its website, the property declares, “Here at Park MGM, we’re not afraid to be different and, as you may have noticed, we’re all about what’s fresh. Now, that includes the air you breathe.” For now, Park MGM is the exception, but smoke-free advocates hope soon, it’ll be the rule.

130,Entertainment,"Switzerland and the Netherlands, two of the favorite's to win  , secured spots in Saturday’s grand final alongside   despite   and booing during its performance. Some 100,000 visitors have gathered in the southern Swedish city of Malmo for the annual kitsch-fest, under heavy police presence as authorities brace for possible unrest. Swiss rapper and singer Nemo, 24, qualified from the second semi-final on Thursday with the song ‘The Code,’ as did Joost Klein, 26, of the Netherlands with his song ‘Europapa.’ “Singing this song in front of a live audience and knowing that so many people are listening made me really emotional,” Nemo said during a news conference following the semi-final. The song, a drum-and-bass, opera, rap, and rock tune, is about Nemo’s journey of self-discovery as a non-binary person. “I think it’s really important that we have so much queer representation this year,” Nemo said, referring to Irish contestants Bambie Thug, who also secured a spot in the final after performing in the first semi-final on Tuesday. Israeli solo artist Eden Golan, 20, and her song ‘Hurricane’ also qualified for Saturday’s grand show, which will feature performances from 26 countries. Some booing was heard from the crowd before, during and after Golan’s performance but also applause and Israeli flags waving, according to a Reuters journalist in the auditorium. “I’m so overwhelmed with emotions,” Golan later told the news conference. “It’s truly such an honor to be here on stage performing and showing our voice and representing us with pride,” she said, adding the organizers had taken precautions to make the event safe for everyone. The solo artist characterizes her song as a strong power ballad that describes a person going through a storm of emotions. Armenia, Austria, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Latvia and Norway also qualified for the final. Eurovision organizers had resisted calls to exclude Israel over its military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, arguing that the competition is a non-political event. More than 10,000 pro-Palestinian campaigners, including climate activist Greta Thunberg, staged a non-violent protest in the hours ahead of the semi-final, waiving Palestinian flags and shouting “boycott Israel”. A smaller group of pro-Israeli supporters, including members of Malmo’s Jewish community, also staged a peaceful demonstration in the city, defending Golan and her nation’s right to take part in the contest. Hundreds of artists in Sweden and elsewhere have pushed for Israel to be blocked from taking part, as did two Belgian government ministers earlier this year. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the event, requested earlier this year that Israel tweak its initial lyrics in order to participate, saying they had originally made reference to the Oct. 7 attack. In a video statement earlier on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Golan for her participation. “You are not only taking on Eurovision in a proud and very impressive manner, you are also contending successfully with an ugly wave of antisemitism — and representing the State of Israel with enormous honor,” Netanyahu said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-secures-spot-eurovision-grand-final-protests-rcna151613,NBC,Israel secures spot in Eurovision grand final despite protests,3

Kai Cenat and two others have already paid more than $57,000 and Cenat publicly apologized after the event in Union Square Park went disastrously wrong on Aug. 4, a spokesperson for the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said Tuesday. The event was not permitted or sanctioned by the city. Cenat, a video game streamer, made promises that he’d give away video game consoles, PCs, gaming chairs and keyboards, among other highly sought-after items. Hundreds attended. Police said bottles, rocks and fireworks were thrown, aerial video showed people standing on cars, and the NYPD said three officers were injured after police were attacked and in the crush of people. “The total restitution of $57,099 covers the landscaping damage and additional staff hours needed for clean-up,” the Manhattan DA’s office said. “All of the restitution payments have already been made.” Cenat, now 22, himself paid $55,000 to the Union Square Partnership under the deal, the district attorney’s office said. He posted an apology on social media Tuesday in which he admitted he created “an unintentional dangerous situation due to the way I promoted and advertised it.” “I am from NY and would never want to see the city turned upside down due to unwanted, irresponsible, and dangerous behavior,” Cenat wrote. “I wanted to do something cool and fun for people and did not think it was going to turn into something that caused harm to the city, and I should have thought more about the post before I announced it,” he wrote. The NYPD arrested Cenat on charges of riot, inciting to riot and unlawful assembly.

132,Entertainment,"Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Thursday signed into law a bill that aims to protect consumers from ticket scalpers and resellers. The legislation is the latest to combat unfair ticketing practices, an issue that has   since the sale of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour tickets in 2022. A Minnesota bill named after Swift was  , requiring ticket price transparency and prohibiting resellers from offering the same ticket more than once.  The bill was first introduced in January by state Sens. Dawn Gile, Brian Feldman, Pamela Beidle and Arthur Ellis.  In a phone interview, Gile said that the bill will create a ""fairer landscape"" for consumers and prevent them from getting ""tricked into paying more than what they should be paying."" ""There was a lot of attention on this bill, and I think it's because people are just so outraged by how expensive tickets are,"" Gile said. Resellers will be prohibited from selling speculative tickets, which are tickets that are not currently in the seller’s possession.  Resellers will also be required to disclose the total price of a ticket, including taxes and fees. They must also issue refunds to ticket purchasers if a ticket turns out to be counterfeit, if the event is canceled or if the ticket does not match what was advertised. The law goes into effect on July 1. Maryland will become the first state to fine resellers and platforms that offer speculative tickets. Moore said in a statement that the law will “help lower costs” for Maryland residents hoping to enjoy live events in the state’s venues. “Resale markets have put rapidly rising costs on consumers and this will help our state protect people from unnecessary price hikes,” Moore said.  Similar legislation has been proposed on a federal level but has yet to move past committee.  The Fans First Act, introduced in December by a bipartisan group of senators, also seeks to ban the sale of speculative tickets and prohibit other deceptive ticketing practices.  Last month,  , including Billie Eilish, Green Day and Chappell Roan, signed a letter in support of the legislation.  “We are joining together to say that the current system is broken: predatory resellers and secondary platforms engage in deceptive ticketing practices to inflate ticket prices and deprive fans of the chance to see their favorite artists at a fair price,"" the letter read.

I will always look back on my time as Miss NJ Teen USA fondly, and the experience of representing my state as a first generation, Mexican-Indian American at the national level was fulfilling in itself.” The resignation comes the same week Noelia Voigt relinquished her crown as Miss USA, citing her mental health.

Laylah Rose, CEO and president of the Miss USA organization, said in a statement to NBC News on Wednesday that “the well-being of all individuals associated with Miss USA is my top priority.” “All along, my personal goal as the head of this organization has been to inspire women to always create new dreams, have the courage to explore it all, and continue to preserve integrity along the way.

Voigt announced on Monday she was resigning as Miss USA to prioritize her mental health. Voigt, 24, who captured the crown in September, posted on   that she was stepping down. “Deep down I know that this is just the beginning of a new chapter for me, and my hope is that I continue to inspire others to remain steadfast, prioritize your mental health, advocate for yourself and others by using your voice, and never be afraid of what the future holds, even if it feels uncertain,” Voigt said.

On May 1, TikTok user Mississippi Memaw (@mississippimemaw) shared a   of her ordering a pickle-filled Dr Pepper at the drive-through of her local Sonic. The video generated 3.8 million views and brought attention to a regional beverage remix that’s been bubbling under the radar. “Do y’all like pickles? Do y’all like Dr Pepper? Well come on with Memaw, cause Memaw’s fitting to show you something,” the TikToker states in her video.  After patiently waiting in the drive-through, a restaurant worker takes Memaw’s order of a large Dr Pepper with pickles. Missing from the exchange is what some might expect to be confusion, although the worker does say she has to charge the customization by marking it down as cherries. The TikToker breezily gets her drink order, paying $3.62 for the concoction.  “Alright I done put my straw in my cup, but let’s see what it looks like,” Memaw says, showing off the floating dill pickle slices in her soda pop. “Don’t knock it till you try it. If you like pickles and you like Dr Pepper, and you’re probably like ‘Ew gross, I would never ever drink that,’ but there’s a lot of people that do drink this,” Memaw says, stirring the pickles further into her drink. “Did you hear her, the way she took my order? I’m not the only person that’s ever ordered this, babe.” Finishing the video by enjoying a long sip of the drink, Memaw encourages her viewers to try it for themselves. “It’s really good. Y’all should try it.” Memaw’s short and sweet video seems to have struck a nerve, with nearly 6,500 comments talking about the flavor combination. “me and 2 year old tried it today!! new favorite,” wrote one commenter. “I got to try this at home bc the way my sonic would call the police on me 😬😮‍💨,” wrote another. “I’ve been drinking dr pepper with pickles since the late 80s,” someone already aware of the beverage chimed in. “But it has to be Best Maid dill!!” Referring to the Sonic employee, someone wrote, “I love how she isn’t even phased 🤣👏,” to which Memaw replied, “Nope 🤣.” Some people who say they are current and former Sonic employees shared their experiences as well. “This was the strangest order I ever remember getting when I worked at Sonic in high school. 🤣,” wrote one user. “I have worked for Sonic for over 20+ years and I have never gotten a customer that has ordered a pickle Dr Pepper,” wrote another, with someone else adding, “it’s probably a regional thing that’s common to order.” Since Memaw’s video went viral, it   are  . Some are   and   on the platform, garnering thousands of views themselves.

And who knows… if your drink innovation is popular enough, it might just end up on our menu!” A representative for Keurig Dr Pepper tells TODAY.com that while the team isn’t aware of any pickle-flavored drinks in the brand’s history, it’s something they’re keeping the door open for. “With regards to future flavors, we always explore new flavors and trends and love that Dr Pepper fans always find a way to make it their own,” the rep says.

Still, as someone who has   with open arms, I had to give this flavor combination a taste. Admittedly, I tried this with ingredients I had at home as my closest Sonic is nearly an hour away. My first thought when I learned about the drink was, “People are just doing anything these days, huh.” But then, I tried it. And, reader, I didn’t hate it! I   thought I would, but then I remembered some of my favorite cocktails are greatly improved with the addition of a  .  In this drink, the briny nature of the pickles adds a little something extra to the sweet and fruity flavors of a Dr Pepper. I drank the whole thing and imagined I would love to add a shot of whiskey while enjoying a rack of barbecue ribs this summer. The original TikToker, who asked to be referred to as Memaw to protect her identity, says while she has indeed inspired tons of folks to put pickles in their Dr Pepper, she wants to stress she didn’t originate the drink. “It has been around for a long time,” Memaw tells TODAY.com. “I’m not gatekeeping it and I didn’t invent it.” Memaw adds she first learned about the drink roughly nine years ago when her daughter asked her to pick one up from Sonic. She tried it and the rest is history. “My daughter at the time was 16. She’s 25 now, and she’s the one that got me to try it for the very first time,” Memaw says.

Macy, who also went viral, says their restaurant in Tennessee has seen a constant influx of orders for the drink since Memaw’s video.  “I haven’t tried it yet, but my coworkers said it’s actually kind of good,” Macy tells TODAY.com. “I still wouldn’t say it’s common, but a lot of people have tried it or at least asked about it now.” Memaw says while she’s glad people are responding well to the video, she’s just going about her life with her four children and five grandchildren, noting that no one in her town is batting an eye at her viral fame. “I didn’t expect it to go viral,” she says. “If I did, I would have at least washed my hair, you know,” she adds with a laugh. “I had it up on a clip and I was like, ah well.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/reason-many-people-are-putting-pickles-dr-pepper-right-now-tastes-rcna151566,NBC,The reason so many people are putting pickles in Dr Pepper right now — and how it tastes,3
135,Entertainment,"A woman who claims to be the inspiration for the stalker character of Martha in “Baby Reindeer” said the popular Netflix show was “defamatory” and called much of the plot a “work of fiction.” Comedian Richard Gadd created and starred in the series, which follows his character, Donny, as he navigates being stalked by an older woman named Martha (played by Jessica Gunning). Though Gadd said the story is based on his true personal experiences, he has   that the character Martha is not meant to resemble her real-life counterpart. But after the show’s popularity boomed, many online began speculating around the real Martha’s identity. The theorizing got so intense that, by late April, Gadd had posted an Instagram story   with their unsubstantiated guesswork. In the  , uploaded to his YouTube page Thursday, Fiona Harvey, 58, said she was “forced” to come forward about her experience after internet sleuths began harassing her online.   The show has “taken over enough of my life. I find it quite obscene. I find it horrifying, misogynistic. Some of the death threats have been really terrible online, people phoning me up,” Harvey said. “It’s been absolutely horrendous. I wouldn’t give credence to something like that, and it’s not really my kind of drama.” Harvey said neither Netflix nor Gadd contacted her about the show, which she also said she has not watched. She said she “absolutely” plans to take legal action against Gadd and Netflix. A spokesperson for Gadd and Netflix did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.  Gadd’s Netflix series was adapted from his one-man show, which  . It’s described on Gadd’s website as a “chilling personal narrative exploring obsession, delusion, and the aftermath of a chance encounter.” Gadd previously   that the show went to “such great lengths to disguise [his stalker] to the point that I don’t think she would recognize herself.”  Watching the show, viewers are met with a message that flashes on screen that reads, “This is a true story.” Later, when the credits roll, the text reads: “This program is based on real events: however certain characters, names, incidents, locations, and dialogue have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes.” In her interview, Harvey disputed several of the incidents and details depicted on the show. She said she met Gadd when she visited a London pub for a meal. Unlike in the show, she said, Gadd never offered her a cup of tea. She said she never caught Gadd looking through her window, heckled his comedy show or attacked his girlfriend. Harvey also said that she did not know where he lived and that she never visited his house, nor did she contact his parents. “That’s completely untrue. Very, very defamatory to me. Very career damaging, and I wanted to report that completely on this show. I’m not a stalker. I’ve not been to jail,” Harvey said. “This is just complete nonsense.” Morgan grilled Harvey about the emails, voice messages, tweets, Facebook messages and letters Martha sent Donny on the show. Harvey said she sent Gadd a handful of emails, tweeted him about 18 times and wrote him one letter. She said she never texted him or messaged him on Facebook. Asked about the show’s title — a moniker that Martha gave Donny — Harvey said she did own a baby reindeer toy as a child. She said her joke mentioning it to Gadd inadvertently gave the show its name. Harvey could not be reached for comment. A spokesperson for Morgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The saga comes amid increased attention surrounding the show and fans’ impulse to “ .” Experts have told NBC News that the desire to sleuth, which has become commonplace on the internet, is a symptom of the internet’s   and its  . Aside from trying to identify real-life Martha, viewers were also trying to pin down Gadd’s real-life inspiration for the character Darrien, a TV comedy writer who sexually assaults Donny. Many online soon began to accuse British actor, writer and director Sean Foley of being real-life Darrien, without real evidence. Foley   that he had called upon the police to investigate viewers’ “defamatory abusive and threatening” posts against him. For Harvey, Gadd’s Instagram statement did little to quell the harassment. “Saying ‘don’t speculate,’ wow, that’s a bit rich now, isn’t it? Fans do speculate,” Harvey told Morgan. “Wednesday, The Daily Mail got in touch with me, so that was all over BBC breaking news Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday.” During a panel discussion Tuesday at a screening in Los Angeles, Gadd   that he never viewed his stalker as a villain, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  “I think I struggle with a toxic empathy problem,” Gadd said. “I remember when I was getting stalked, it was relentless and felt like it was everywhere, and I felt like my life wasn’t really functioning. I still had these unbelievable pangs of feeling sorry for her.” Harvey told Morgan that she was not under the impression that Gadd ever felt sorry for her. “I think he’s psychotic, and I think that anyone going along, being in that play and doing this to somebody, I find the behavior outrageous,” she said, later adding that she “should never have gone in that bar.” Angela Yang is a culture and trends reporter for NBC News.",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/baby-reindeer-alleged-martha-speaks-out-piers-morgan-rcna151585,NBC,Woman who allegedly inspired stalker character in 'Baby Reindeer' says show was 'defamatory',3

Thursday’s concert introduced a new setlist that reordered certain eras — including by moving “Red” up to earlier in the night — and combining the “Evermore” and “Folklore” eras, according to social media users who posted from the concert. She  . More than a quarter of tickets for the four Paris shows this weekend were purchased by Americans, according to Frédéric Longuépée, CEO of the París La Défense Arena. Tickets for the venue’s shows all sold in under an hour, he added. “To the best of my understanding, a lot of Americans chose to come to Paris to attend this show and obviously visit our beautiful city,” said Longuépée, who estimated “something like 25–30%” of the crowd would be Americans, “which is big.” Kennedy Smith, 21, skipped her college graduation to fly with her mother, Kathleen Smith, 56, from Texas to Paris to attend Swift’s concert instead. Kathleen Smith said getting to see the singer was “nothing short of a miracle” — the pair stayed up all night in hopes of securing tickets, which cost them around $1,500 each. The two were first in line Wednesday to purchase merchandise at the venue, walking away with two bags full of Swift-themed gear. Her daughter called the experience the “trip of a lifetime.” “This is my graduation-from-college gift at Texas A&M,” she said. “And I’ve always wanted to come to Europe. ...

Some fans had reported that their invite codes failed to work, while others said they abruptly lost the tickets they had already placed in their cart. The chaos, which garnered a response  , led Ticketmaster to offer some scorned fans   at buying tickets. The saga continued last year when Ticketmaster   for the “Eras Tour” shows in Paris and Lyon, after the website crashed amid technical glitches and hourslong wait times plaguing the more than 700,000 fans in the queue. Zoe McCormack, a Canadian fan who  , said she managed to get tickets the following week for multiple nights in Paris, where she now lives. She said her non-VIP tickets here cost €190 each, or about $205, making them more affordable than U.S. tickets. Many tickets for Swift’s shows in Europe cost only a fraction of what tickets cost for her U.S. dates, making them more financially accessible for North American fans who either failed to secure tickets in the U.S. last year or found prices too exorbitant. Some resale tickets sold for tens of thousands of dollars. “I’m so happy that she came to Paris, especially since she has that ‘Paris’ song. I’ve been waiting for this moment ever since I moved to Paris,” McCormack said. “I’m so excited to be here. I can’t believe that it’s already here because we got the tickets almost a year ago. So it’s been a whole year of anticipation, getting the costumes ready, getting our bracelets ready.” Traveling to see concerts abroad is not a new phenomenon, as buying tickets for concerts in the U.S. has become an increasingly competitive and highly expensive ordeal for fans of popular artists such as Swift,   and  .

137,Entertainment,"It’s easier to change an   lyric than it is to change a tattoo of it — and that’s exactly what the singer vowed to do for fan Grace Flemming. Flemming, 20, first heard Rodrigo’s song “Hope Ur OK” in 2021, when the three-time Grammy-winning singer released it on her album “Sour.” She immediately “knew” she wanted a tattoo of one of the lyrics, “address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings,” the Colorado resident tells TODAY.com. She finally got the ink last month on her waist, only to later discover that it incorrectly read “butterwings” instead of “butterfly wings.” Flemming  , encouraging people to double check spellings before getting tattoos. Flemming is emotional in the video that now has more than a million views. In the caption, she asks Rodrigo to change the lyric so her tattoo is correct. “I’m literally crying over my nails right now,” she says in the viral video. The “Vampire” singer left a comment May 6 saying Flemming’s tattoo was the new lyric. “HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH OMG THIS IS THE NEW LYRIC IM CHANGING IT TO BUTTERWINGS,” Rodrigo wrote. Flemming says she can’t believe Rodrigo saw the video, let alone responded. Now, she doesn’t know if she’ll take up the tattoo artist’s offer to fix the tattoo so it matches the original lyric. “Not changing it definitely makes it more unique and special. I kind of want to keep it, but also want to get the right lyrics. Maybe I’ll keep this one, and get the   lyrics somewhere else,” she says. The lyric is her favorite of Rodrigo’s, Flemming says. She has long admired how caterpillars turn into butterflies. “Everybody already has their own wounds or holes. So I take the (line), ‘Address the letters to the holes of my butterfly wings,’ (to say) if somebody’s gonna say something mean, they can say it to me. But, it’s just gonna go through me. It’s gonna go through that hole,” she says. She toyed around with actually getting the tattoo for three years. Once her mind was made up, though, it only took her a week to plan the design. Flemming asked her tattoo artist to stitch together words Rodrigo had previously written in letters and emails sent to fans so the tattoo would appear to be in the singer’s handwriting. “I have loved Olivia since 2015. It was so exciting to have a piece of my favorite artist on me,” she says.

I can’t wait,’” she says. She left the parlor joyful and unaware of the error. Then, she then sent a picture to her boyfriend, who immediately noticed the typo. “The little bubbles were typing for so long. And I was like, ‘What is he going to say? Does he think it looks bad? What is it?’” she says. He finally responded, “Did you take out the ‘fly’?” Flemming says she “just stared at his text,” thinking, “There is no way.” She went to sleep and woke up the next day assuming it was just a dream, she says. But it wasn’t a dream. In the month since getting the tattoo, Flemming says she has encountered an array of reactions. People have called her “stupid” for not actually reading the stencil. She shrugs those comments off, saying most people she encounters don’t even notice the mistake until she points it out. Her mom, who does not like any of her five tattoos, has used the mix-up to bolster her case of why she “shouldn’t get tattoos.” She’s learned to embrace the error. “Sometimes I get a little angry about it. But it’s so funny. I tell random strangers who are like, ‘I like your tattoo,’ and I’m like, ‘Oh, well let me show you,” she says. “It’s kind of become such a big thing where I’m kind of like, ‘Oh, this is a really good mistake.’”",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/olivia-rodrigo-responds-fan-got-lyric-tattooed-major-typo-rcna151325,NBC,Olivia Rodrigo responds to fan who got a lyric tattooed with a major typo,3

141,Politics,"Attorneys for former President Donald Trump sought to pierce   Thursday, casting the adult film actor as someone whose retelling of their alleged sexual encounter was rife with inconsistencies and driven by a desire to harm him. Trump’s lawyer Susan Necheles asked Daniels on the stand in Manhattan criminal court in New York City about making “a lot of money” from her story over the years, striking deals worth a million dollars or more. She also needled Daniels over the different ways she has described the encounter in magazine and prime-time interviews, as well as in the courtroom. Daniels pushed back, saying that while she made a living speaking out against Trump, “I was not selling myself to anyone.” Daniels’ story is   of the prosecution's hush money case against Trump. The bid to silence her in the waning days of the 2016 presidential race came as Trump’s campaign feared he could not withstand further damage after a recording of him talking about inappropriately “grabbing” women threatened to derail his candidacy. Trump has been charged with 34 state counts related to falsifying business records, which prosecutors say were used to obscure the payments to Daniels. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. He has also denied having had an affair with Daniels. Here's what you missed on Day 14 of the criminal trial. Necheles pressed Daniels about varying details in her retelling of the 2006 encounter with Trump, such as her saying she felt light-headed, which Daniels did not include in media interviews. On Thursday, Necheles, the Trump attorney, asked Daniels more than two dozen times about her account, casting it as a fabrication used to extort money at a sensitive time for Trump. Necheles said that Daniels “wanted to make money” from the attention and that she had even made it the “centerpiece” of her 2018 book. “You were threatening that you would try to hurt President Trump politically by telling this story if he didn’t give you money, right?” Necheles asked. She also pointed to merchandise Daniels marketed online, including a $40 “Stormy Saint of Indictments” candle and a “Stormy Daniels Political Power” comic book. Necheles further noted that Daniels appeared to celebrate Trump’s indictment in the case by tweeting the same day about popping champagne. “That was me doing my job,” Daniels said in response. The defense also suggested that prosecutors had worked to shape Daniels’ testimony before she took the stand for the first time Tuesday. Necheles asked her whether she was supposed to include certain details at their urging and from her book.Trump’s attorneys have sought throughout the trial to portray certain witnesses as selectively highlighting facts to help the Manhattan district attorney’s case. “There’s nothing wrong with detail,” Daniels said Thursday. “My story never changed,” she said later. Another Trump attorney, Todd Blanche, cited Daniels' lurid testimony of the alleged encounter with Trump as he renewed a bid for a mistrial, arguing it was prejudicial when Daniels described “an imbalance of power” between herself and Trump, even as she said she did not feel physically threatened, and when she recalled a “spanking” with a rolled-up magazine. “None of that is information that goes to motive,” Blanche said. The judge rejected the mistrial motion. He also dismissed a request by the defense to loosen the rules on the gag order against Trump. Two new witnesses who worked for Trump took the stand Thursday under subpoena: a Trump Organization employee and Trump’s former executive assistant in the White House. Both gave compelling testimony about Trump’s micromanagement of his affairs, such as his signing off on $6,000 annual dues to a golf club, for which he wrote ""PAY ASAP OK"" on the invoice. Madeleine Westerhout, the former White House assistant, described Trump's habits, including how he liked to keep his Oval Office desk pristine for meetings and used the dining room as his “working office.” There, he would be “working, reading, going over documents,” she said, noting that while he kept things organized, he did have a lot of papers. “I found that he always knew where things were,” Westerhout said. She said he “liked hard-copy documents” and, to her knowledge, did not have an email address. Westerhout left the White House after she spoke disparagingly about Trump’s family at a meeting with reporters that she believed was off the record; her comments were reported publicly. In contrast to Daniels, Westerhout spoke warmly of Trump, painting a picture of a family man who cared deeply about his wife, Melania Trump. Rebecca Manochio, the Trump Organization employee who took the stand Thursday, testified about how checks were handled both before and during Trump's time in office. She described putting together checks with their invoices for Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg to sign, which he continued to do after Trump took office. Certain checks required Trump’s signature, Manochio said, and she recalled at least one occasion when she sent just one. Trump took notes and gazed ahead as Manochio told the court that roughly once a week she would send checks by FedEx for Trump to sign at the White House. She then mailed the checks that Westerhout would handle at the White House. A third new witness for the day — Tracey Menzies, an executive at HarperCollins — testified to the accuracy of certain excerpts from a book by Trump that her company published, “Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and in Life.” An excerpt that was introduced into the court record focused on Trump’s urging to “value loyalty above everything” at the Trump Organization and on how he claimed to “go out of my way” to make life “miserable” for a woman he said “was very disloyal.” Westerhout described Trump’s process for using Twitter, now X, when he was in the White House. She said that besides Trump, only deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino had access to the president's account in 2017 and that Trump had a distinct style. “There were certain words that he liked to capitalize … and he liked to use exclamation points,” Westerhout said. “It’s my understanding that he liked to use the Oxford comma.” She also recalled how Michael Cohen met with Trump at the White House but did not specifically remember seeing him there. The meeting is a key event in the prosecution's narrative of an election interference plot. Westerhout described Trump as detail-oriented and said he preferred to sign documents himself using a Sharpie or a Pentel felt-tip pen. She recounted that Trump would sign every check by hand in his office and return them to her in a folder. Trump signed a lot of material, Westerhout said while being questioned by Necheles. She also talked about a text message she sent to Hope Hicks, a top aide to Trump, asking, “Hey — the president wants to know if you called David Pecker again?” Pecker, a former publisher of the National Enquirer, previously testified about his role in a scheme to “catch and kill” stories potentially damaging to Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, including an account by Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who said she had a monthslong relationship with Trump starting about a decade before the election. After the jury left the courtroom Thursday, Trump's attorney Blanche mentioned that the DA's office had informed him that prosecutors will no longer call McDougal to testify.

142,Politics,"Two Russian online film distributors, including a company owned by Nasdaq-listed internet giant Yandex have been charged with offenses under the country’s so-called LGBT propaganda law, a notice on a Moscow court’s website said. Russia last year   its restrictions on the promotion of what it calls LGBT propaganda amid a broader clampdown on queer rights, which President Vladimir Putin has sought to portray as evidence of moral decay in Western countries. The companies, Kinopoisk and Restream Media, face an administrative case for the “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships” or “gender reassignment” online, according to the notice posted on Wednesday. Separate charges were filed on Wednesday against two Kinopoisk and Restream Media executives for the same offense, an online court notice showed. Yandex-owned Kinopoisk and Restream Media, majority-owned by digital services giant Rostelecom have both been   under a similar article banning the “demonstration” of LGBTQ relationships to minors. That resulted from them listing films such as “Bridget Jones’s Diary” and “Perfect Strangers” without an 18+ label. A spokesperson for Kinopoisk told Reuters that the charge was related to its listing of the U.S. television series “Supergirl,” which features a same-sex relationship, and that the company planned to challenge the court ruling. “The laws and regulations as currently drafted do not provide sufficient objective criteria for determining propaganda of non-traditional relationships,” the company said in a statement provided to Reuters. “We hope that the current practice of fines against online cinemas will be revised to warnings.” Restream Media did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment.",https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/two-russian-online-film-distributors-charged-lgbt-propaganda-law-rcna151472,NBC,Two Russian online film distributors charged under 'LGBT propaganda' law,1
143,Politics,"President Joe Biden is trying to thread the needle on Israel’s war against Hamas, but his   to Benjamin Netanyahu’s government left some in Washington wondering whether he’s lost that thread. “Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,” Biden   Wednesday. “I made it clear that if they go into Rafah — they haven’t gone in Rafah yet — if they go into Rafah, I’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities — that deal with that problem.” In point of fact, Israel is conducting limited military operations in Rafah, the Gaza city where more than 1 million Palestinians have clustered since the war began in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack on the Jewish state. Biden said Israel has not yet crossed a “red line” by going into population centers. But at the same time the Biden administration is delaying an official certification that U.S. weapons aren’t being used to undercut humanitarian efforts to protect civilians, the president is drawing a new rhetorical line in the sand. Some in his own party see that as counterproductive to Biden’s policy and political aims. He would like the war to conclude as soon as possible, with the release of Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas, and he would like for pro-Palestinian activists to stop hammering him at home as he seeks re-election. “The problem is this message that they’re sending can’t accomplish both of those things,” said one Democratic lawmaker who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer candid criticism of Biden’s position. “Because now, if you want Hamas to release the hostages and they see the U.S. pulling back, it relieves the pressure on Hamas.” This lawmaker said that figures to lengthen the war, rather than bringing a conclusion, which in turn threatens to extend Biden’s domestic political quandary. “If the hostages are not going to be released, then the war is going to continue, with or without U.S. missiles,” the lawmaker said. Republicans were quick to condemn Biden’s position. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who recently worked with the Biden White House to enact an aid package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan,   that he hopes Biden’s remarks were a “senior moment.” And in an interview with North Carolina’s Spectrum News 1, former President Donald Trump said he “wouldn’t do what Biden did.” “He just abandoned Israel,” Trump said.  But progressives welcomed what they saw as a turn in the right direction.  “Biden has taken the position that 37 Democrats did in voting no on offensive weapons to Gaza that could be used for an invasion in Rafah,” said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a co-chair of Biden’s campaign. “That now is the mainstream Democratic position, and the recent vote on the offensive weapons to Israel will be seen akin to the Iraq War one.” Last month, Democrats voted 173-37 for a stand-alone measure that provided aid to Israel, including for offensive weapons, before it was wrapped into the larger package of foreign military assistance that Biden signed into law. If Biden is mainstreaming the progressive view, he’s doing so at the potential cost of standing with roughly 20% of his party’s House contingent and against the vast majority of Republican officials inside and outside Congress. The question for Biden as he tries to manage Israel’s war from afar is whether he’ll net more support at home by moving closer to the pro-Palestinian progressives who have given him fits since the start of the war. Adult film star Stormy Daniels returned to the stand in  , pushing back during cross-examination on his defense attorney’s attempts to discredit her in sometimes bizarre and uncomfortable exchanges.  Trump’s attorney Susan Necheles grilled Daniels about the $130,000 nondisclosure agreement she signed with Trump’s then-attorney Michael Cohen near the close of the 2016 election, and tried to poke holes in her now-sworn statements about the sexual encounter she says she had with Trump, which he denies.  Necheles asked her about the number of porn films she’s written and directed, and said, “You have a lot of experience making phony stories about sex.” “Wow. That’s not how I would put it,” Daniels replied. “The sex in the films is very much real, just like what happened to me in that room” with Trump. She added, “If that story was untrue, I would’ve written it to be a lot better.” Madeleine Westerhout, Trump’s former White House executive assistant, was called as a witness later in the day. 💲 Will Trump take the stand? He previously said that he “absolutely” would testify, but has since softened those comments.  Two of Trump’s   come with politically fraught complications: the Republican governors who would choose their successors. If Trump goes with   of Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis would be in line to select his replacement — perhaps immediately if Rubio resigns and relocates to avoid the constitutional hang-up of having both candidates on the ticket residing in the same state. If   of Ohio becomes vice president, Gov. Mike DeWine would pick a new senator. Both governors have  ,   with Trump, raising doubts about whether the people they appoint would meet the often rigid right-wing standards of his MAGA movement. And while the succession dynamic will not necessarily sink Rubio’s or Vance’s chances of being selected, it is the subject of speculative conversation in both states. DeSantis and Trump are coming off a bitter clash for the GOP presidential nomination. Though there are signs of détente, enough trust issues remain that the idea of handing DeSantis the power of a Senate appointment is one that Trump world is approaching cautiously. In Ohio, Trump   against DeWine’s endorsed candidate, state Sen. Matt Dolan, in a recent GOP Senate primary, branding DeWine as a crusty establishment avatar and RINO.

144,Politics,"The   is expected to propose a rule Thursday that would accelerate the pace at which certain migrants could be processed and denied asylum after having crossing the southern border, according to two sources familiar with the decision. The regulation, which had been in the works for months and will be published by the Department of Homeland Security, seeks to cut down on illegal border crossings. It would specifically target people who are deemed ineligible for asylum because of criminal records or who are assessed to be national security risks, one of the sources said.  The asylum process  , and the proposed rule will aim to shorten that time substantially for those deemed ineligible.

As the Biden administration   on the border that could affect the asylum process, up Pennsylvania Avenue, Senate Democrats had an initial closed-door conversation Wednesday about what legislative steps they could take. “I think the starting point for the discussion is the bipartisan deal that was negotiated, so we’ll start there. Do we subtract a little bit, do we add a little bit? We don’t know yet,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NBC News after the meeting. “Everybody realizes we are going to have a meaningful discussion about it in the coming weeks.” NBC News reported Monday that Democrats in the Senate could force “messaging” votes on immigration and border-related provisions that Republicans would most likely block. Republicans blocked the bipartisan package negotiated by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., in February at the behest of former President Donald Trump.  But asked about the administration’s actions during his leadership news conference Wednesday, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Biden administration and congressional Democrats “agree” that “the best thing to deal with the problem on the border is pass legislation.” “We have strong bipartisan drafted legislation,” Schumer said. “If Republicans are serious about fixing the border, join us — we can only pass it with Republican votes, Democratic votes and Republican votes, and that’s what we should do.” Senators threw out ideas during the closed-door meeting Wednesday, according to multiple Democrats who spoke with NBC News.  Earlier Wednesday, a collection of progressive and Hispanic lawmakers   to streamline pathways to citizenship for long-term, undocumented immigrants and expressed concerns with the administration’s potential plans to restrict some asylum through unilateral action. “As the Biden administration considers executive actions on immigration, we must not return to failed Trump-era policies aimed at banning asylum and moving us backward,” Sen.

145,Politics,"The Democratic National Committee is making new tech investments to bolster its efforts to reach young voters and voters of color in an increasingly fragmented environment,   laying out the party’s strategies in the months leading up to the general election. Bolstered by the over $192 million they have amassed in the first quarter of this year, Democrats have doled out millions to acquire data and new technology to specifically target voters in battleground states and create a “data infrastructure” that can equally be used by national and state parties.  The party has invested $2 million this cycle in cellphone data to better target voters in battleground states, according to the memo, which touted expanding its cellphone coverage on voter lists from 30% of voters in 2016 to over 80% now. An additional $2 million annually has been invested in “models and commercial data to better understand voters.” The Democrats point to the Wisconsin state Supreme Court race as evidence of the benefit of having such data on file, citing the 1.4 million calls and texts Wisconsin Democrats made to support candidates last year, including Janet Protasiewicz, who was elected to the court. The DNC says that so far, it has made 1.2 million calls and sent 5.4 million texts to engage voters and promote events, recruit for organizing activities and support voter registration efforts in battleground states. It plans to invest more in its relational organizing programs to better reach young voters and voters of color before the election. That includes a Wisconsin-based pilot program that has been engaging with youth voters on college campuses in Green Bay, Madison, Milwaukee and Eau Claire. Ahead of President Joe Biden’s campaign event in Racine, Wisconsin, on Wednesday, attendees were trained in how to use a relational organizing app, REACH, which the campaign described as a program helping “voters connect with people they already know about the importance of the election.” The bet is that friends and peers will be best placed to persuade on-the-fence people in their social networks to back Biden. “Over the last several months, REACH has been used successfully by Team Biden-Harris supporters and volunteers in the Black community as part of a first-of-its-kind relational organizing program in Milwaukee,” Garren Randolph, the campaign manager for the Wisconsin Democratic Coordinated Campaign, wrote in a memo this week. The DNC also touted other investments in its memo. , which Biden comfortably won in 2020, Democrats are also broadening their investments to target traditionally red states. This election cycle, the party has invested more than $4.5 million in its Red State Fund, which allocates resources for programs in traditionally Republican states. Kentucky, where Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear won re-election last year, is among the red states that have seen big increases in national party investment. And the DNC also touted new investments in election security measures. It said in its memo it’s making seven-figure investments in a “robust voter protection operation,” including launching an online training system comprised of 57 videos, training voting staff members in topics from election administration and ballot curing to organizing and federal law. In addition, the party said it will continue to support a voter assistance hotline. It said that it received over 28,000 calls in the 2022 midterms and that so far this cycle it has received more than 9,000.

The investor,  , had been on the board of directors of the publicly traded company,  , at the time he was accused of sharing and exploiting non-public information with others about its plans to merge with then-privately held Trump Media, the owner of the Truth Social app. Trump Media’s majority shareholder is former President  , who was not accused of any wrongdoing in the case against Garelick in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. But Garelick’s trial, which began on April 30, took place just blocks away from where Trump is on trial in Manhattan Supreme Court on criminal charges related to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Two co-defendants of Garelick, the brothers Michael and Gerald Shvartsman, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges on April 3. Jurors in Garelick’s case began deliberating on Wednesday afternoon after hearing closing arguments from prosecutors and a defense lawyer. After several hours of deliberation Thursday, jurors returned guilty verdicts on the five counts of securities fraud and conspiracy that the 54-year-old Garelick faced. Garelick, who testified at his trial, is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 12. Garelick was an investment advisor to Michael Shvartsman’s venture capital firm, Rocket One Capital. Prosecutors said Garelick shared non-public material information about DWAC’s merger plans with Trump Media with the Shvartsman brothers in 2021 after joining DWAC’s board. All three men then bought up DWAC stock based on that non-public information and then sold their shares after the price soared following the announcement of the deal to combine with Trump Media, prosecutors said. Garelick made a profit of just $49,000 on the illicit trades, but the Shvartsmans earned a whopping $23 million, according to prosecutors. “Bruce Garelick was part of a sophisticated group of individuals invited to invest in Digital World Acquisition Corporation ..., a special purpose acquisition company that had raised funds with the intention of later investing in a target company, Trump Media & Technology Group, not yet known to the public,” said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in a statement Thursday. “When he was given that opportunity, Garelick promised to keep the information about DWAC’s interest in acquiring Trump Media secret and not use it to trade in the stock market. Garelick was also given a seat on DWAC’s board, which gave him direct access to additional non-public information regarding the acquisition,” Williams said. “As a unanimous jury has just found, Garelick blatantly violated the law by using the information that he obtained as an insider at DWAC to trade and tip others,” the top prosecutor said. “Garelick’s federal conviction is yet another stark reminder that insider trading is always a losing bet.” DWAC and Trump Media completed their merger in late March.

It's unclear   in his own defense. When Daniels was on the stand, Trump attorney Susan Necheles grilled her about the $130,000 nondisclosure agreement she signed with Trump's then-attorney Michael Cohen near the close of the 2016 election and tried to poke holes in her now-sworn statements about the sexual encounter she says she had with Trump, which he denies. Necheles asked her about the number of porn films she has written and directed and said, “You have a lot of experience making phony stories about sex.” “Wow. That’s not how I would put it,"" Daniels replied. ""The sex in the films is very much real, just like what happened to me in that room” with Trump. She added, ""If that story was untrue, I would’ve written it to be a lot better.” Necheles and Daniels sparred over minor inconsistencies in Daniels’ stories, including her having said in a 2011 interview that she and Trump had dinner together while she now maintains they never actually ate. “I had dinner in the room, but we never got any food, and we never ate anything,"" Daniels said. Prosecutor Susan Hoffinger noted on re-direct examination that the article with the 2011 interview said the piece had been ""lightly edited."" Necheles also sought to dispute Daniels' claims that she was scared when she saw Trump waiting for her in bed in a T-shirt and boxers after she got out of the bathroom, implying that a porn actor wouldn't be caught off-guard by someone in underwear. Necheles asked whether it was the first time in her life someone had made a pass at her. Daniels said it was the first time with somebody ""twice my age and bigger than me"" who had a bodyguard outside the door. “You wanted money from President Trump, right?” Necheles asked earlier in their exchange. “No,” Daniels answered. “I never asked for money from President Trump,” she said. “I never asked for money from anyone in particular. I asked for money to tell my story” in 2016, and it was Cohen who approached her attorney with the NDA. She said she thought the agreement was “a perfect solution,” giving her a paper trail and peace of mind without having to tell her story publicly. Daniels also acknowledged that she was irate when Cohen appeared to be stalling on paying the money but that he eventually paid. Necheles also asked about a statement she signed in 2018 denying she'd had an affair with Trump after The Wall Street Journal wrote about her NDA. Daniels said her lawyer had given her the statement and told her she had to sign it. She said she decided she wanted to tell her story later that year, after Cohen began talking about her publicly. Asked whether she'd promised people she'd be instrumental in putting Trump in jail, Daniels said, ""No."" Necheles then asked her about a social media post in which someone had called her a human toilet, and Daniels responded, ""Exactly! Making me the best person to flush the orange turd down."" Necheles asked whether that meant she'd be instrumental in getting rid of him. Daniels said it was ""hyperbole.""  ""I'm also not a toilet,"" she said. Daniels spoke more slowly and seemed more confident Thursday than on her first day on the stand, but her voice shook some when Necheles asked her about various mean tweets she has been the target of, including ones referring to her as an ""aging harlot"" and a “disgusting degenerate prostitute.” “When somebody attacks me I’m going to defend myself,” she said, sounding like she was on the verge of tears. After Daniels was done testifying, her lawyer Clark Brewster told NBC News she was ""shaken"" by the ordeal and ""relieved"" to be done. “She was cross-examined over communications over years, and having your memory challenged like that and having to respond to questions immediately with recall is not easy, and it was quite an accomplishment,” Brewster said, adding, “She did a remarkable job of getting her testimony across.” During the discussion about the defense’s renewed request for a mistrial, Merchan said he was surprised Trump's lawyers didn’t object to certain parts of Daniels’ testimony. He cited one part where Daniels said Trump told her: “I thought we were getting somewhere, we were talking, and I thought you were serious about what you wanted. If you ever want to get out of that trailer park.” “I was offended because I never lived in a trailer park,” Daniels said. The judge said he struck that part of her testimony. Trump sat with his eyes closed for parts of Daniels' testimony. He was accompanied to court by Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who left in the late morning. On his way out of court, Scott took some jabs at three people whom Trump is prevented from criticizing by the gag order in the case — Judge Juan Merchan's daughter, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's wife and prosecutor Matthew Colangelo. Scott didn’t name any of the three, but it was clear from his remarks — including saying ""the judge's daughter is a political operative"" — to whom he was referring. It's unclear whether prosecutors will try to argue the comments violated the gag order. The ruling bars Trump from making ""or directing others to make"" comments about individual prosecutors or relatives of people involved with the case, in addition to remarks about witnesses and jurors. Madeleine Westerhout, Trump’s former White House executive assistant, testified later in the day that she had seen Trump sign checks in the Oval Office and that he had been “very upset” by Daniels’ claims. Westerhout said she got to know Trump while she was working at the Republican National Committee in 2016. She said there was concern at the RNC in October 2016 after the release of the so-called ""Access Hollywood"" tape, a 2005 recording of Trump saying he can grope women without their consent. Asked whether there were conversations at the RNC about potentially replacing Trump as the Republican nominee at that time, Westerhout said there were. Trump remained the nominee and won the election, and she said she helped the president-elect schedule meetings at Trump Tower, which is what led to her White House job. Her duties included acting as an intermediary between Trump and his company the Trump Organization, coordinating with Rhona Graff, Trump's assistant there, on issues that needed his or the company's attention, like his travel schedule, mail or phone calls.  She said she asked Graff for a list of Trump's contacts, which Graff forwarded to her. The list included information for Cohen and  , the former National Enquirer publisher who testified he worked with Trump and Cohen to suppress scandalous stories about Trump, including Daniels' claim. Westerhout said Trump was ""very upset"" when the Daniels story became public. She broke down in tears as she recalled losing her job in August 2019, after she   about Trump's family at a dinner with reporters that she believed to be confidential. She called the incident a mistake and said, ""I've learned a lot from my experience."" She also defended her former boss, saying she believed he has been treated unfairly. She will continue her testimony Friday. After Daniels was done testifying, Blanche told the judge that she'd changed her story by saying she felt there was a power imbalance between them and that she blacked out and was light-headed when they began having sex. He also said there was no reason for prosecutors to have asked her about supposedly spanking him with a magazine before the encounter or for Daniels to have testified that Trump did not use a condom. ""That has nothing to do with the false business record, but it’s so prejudicial. It’s a dog whistle for rape,” Blanche said. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told Merchan: “Those messy details, that is motive. That is Mr. Trump’s motive” for buying her silence. He also suggested that Trump could rebut the story under oath. “If they want to offer testimony that the sex never happened, that’s their prerogative,” he said. He also said there were some ""very salacious details that were intentionally omitted because we did not have the desire to embarrass the defendant.” Merchan said he agreed with Blanche that there shouldn’t have been questions or answers about the condom, but noted that there was no objection from attorneys to that line of questioning at the time. The judge also pointed out that Blanche had said in his opening statement that Trump didn’t have sexual relations with Daniels. “Your denial puts the jury in a position of having to choose who they believe. Donald Trump, who denies that there was an encounter, or Stormy Daniels, who claims that there was,” Merchan said. In addition to the sexual encounter, which Daniels said happened after she met Trump at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, she told jurors that Trump made a sexual advance in 2007, which she rejected. Four years later, she said, a mysterious man warned her to “ ” after she gave an interview to a magazine about their first encounter. Daniels said the article never ran thanks to Trump's then-“fixer” and lawyer Cohen. Cohen later paid Daniels $130,000 to keep quiet about her claim. Trump's reimbursement of that money to Cohen is at the heart of the criminal case against Trump, who is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to the repayment. He has pleaded not guilty. Daniels was followed on the stand by Rebecca Manochio, a Trump Organization employee who was an assistant to the company's former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. She said that after Trump went to the White House, she would FedEx checks for him to sign and then get them to the proper person at the company when they were returned. Her testimony was used to enter records relating to Trump's checks to Cohen. After Manochio, prosecutors called Tracy Menzies, an executive at HarperCollins Publishers. She was brought in to read into the record from a book Trump co-authored for the company called ""Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life."" One of the 2007 book's chapters was titled ""Do Not Trust Anyone."" ""I just can't stomach disloyalty,"" the book reads, mentioning a woman who had been disloyal. ""I go out of my way to make her life miserable,” the book says. “My motto is 'Always get even. When somebody screws you, screw them back in spades.'” The DA's office is nearing its final set of witnesses. Steinglass estimated this week that prosecutors would be done presenting their case by May 21. One person who won’t be testifying is Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model who claims she had a monthslong affair with Trump that began in 2006 and was paid $150,000 to keep quiet in 2016 by the National Enquirer. Trump has denied her claim. Blanche told Merchan that prosecutors informed him she wouldn’t be taking the stand. Adam Reiss is a reporter and producer for NBC and MSNBC.

148,Politics,"Fifty-six scanning systems that can detect fentanyl in personal vehicles at southern U.S. border crossings will now be installed because of $200 million in new funding that was approved by Congress after   the scanners were sitting unused in warehouses. Ninety-five percent of the fentanyl U.S. law enforcement seizes is discovered in personal vehicles driven across the border by U.S. citizens, according to Department of Homeland Security officials, and the scanners are the strongest tool the Biden administration has to detect fentanyl in vehicles. After the NBC News report,  ,   and two   called for additional funding to install the scanners that had been previously requested by DHS. Funding to finally install the machines came through the House Homeland Security appropriations bill,  . The 56 that will be installed because of the new funding will be in place by 2026, according to a senior Customs and Border Protection official. Thirty-one scanning systems are already in place, and 27 are under construction. All of the scanners were appropriated in 2021. DHS says that once the scanners are in place, 40% of all personal vehicles crossing the border will be scanned. Now, fewer than 5% of personal vehicles are X-rayed, according to DHS officials.  At ports of entry without scanners, customs officers have to rely on their own intuition to detect something amiss and hold vehicles for further inspection. Since 2021, the U.S. government has struggled to install fentanyl scanners at ports of entry. Critics have applauded the progress but say it’s still just a drop in the bucket. Bobby Watt was at CBP for over 30 years and oversaw non-intrusive inspection scanning at ports of entry before he left CBP in 2019; he blames red tape for the delays. He says the goal should be to scan 100% of personal vehicles. “It’d be foolish not to,” said Watt, now an adviser to scanning contractor Viken Detection. “Because if you were a drug smuggler, would you go to a port that had an X-ray? Or would you go to the one next to it that didn’t have an X-ray?”  DHS has pointed to construction challenges with installation, such as a lack of room at ports of entry to install the systems, and says it doesn’t have the funding from Congress needed to scan 100% of vehicles. The senior CBP official said the 40% of vehicles that will be scanned won’t be randomly chosen; instead, they’ll be vehicles determined to pose the highest risk. New congressional funding to reach 40% of the vehicles was hailed by some parents who have lost children to fentanyl, like Cindy DeMaio, who lost her daughter in Ohio to fentanyl poisoning in 2016. DeMaio works with parents around the country to educate others about fentanyl, including putting up billboards along the southern border where fentanyl is being driven across. “Anything we can do to increase the catching of these people and decrease the negative impacts on our country is extremely powerful,” she said. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has criticized the slow efforts to install the scanners. In the fall he called for the Government Accountability Office to examine how DHS has spent more than a billion dollars on the X-ray equipment. The inquiry is underway, a GAO spokesperson said, and a report will be completed this year. Cornyn and Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., want any new scanners to be tested to ensure that any technology purchased in the future is the most effective. They introduced a   this year to evaluate five kinds of scanners to ensure they catch the most fentanyl.  “Last year, Customs and Border Protection seized enough fentanyl at the southern border to kill every American 16 times over, and we have no way of knowing how much more evaded law enforcement,” Cornyn said. “This legislation would help address glaring problems in the fentanyl detection system by requiring CBP to test new pieces of detection technology at land ports of entry so we can prevent this deadly drug from claiming more lives.” In a statement, a CBP spokesperson said, ""CBP has repeatedly sought funding for the installation of NII [scanner] technology — including the civil works funding needed to install existing systems, which was requested in the supplemental funding request in October 2023 and partially funded by the recent appropriation."" ""Non-intrusive inspection technology is one tool in in CBP’s multi-layered approach to interdicting fentanyl and contraband,"" said the spokesperson.

149,Politics,"HIALEAH, Fla. — Some Florida groups that support abortion rights are concerned that a ballot measure to and invalidate the recently enacted six-week abortion ban may not pass in November if more donor money is not pumped into these organizations to raise awareness and turn out voters. “This bill passing is not a slam-dunk deal by any means,” said Alex Berrios, co-founder of the progressive group Mi Vecino, which is focused on voter education and mobilization. “While there is overall support for the ballot measure, there is not nearly enough without persuading undecided voters.” Florida   after six weeks of gestation — before many women know they're pregnant —  to adapt  Until the ban went into effect,   in the Southeast where abortion was still largely accessible. Now the closest state with abortion access beyond six weeks is North Carolina, where it is allowed until 12 weeks. The proposed amendment would invalidate the six-week ban by barring restrictions on abortion before fetal viability, considered to be at about the 24th week of pregnancy. It would also include exceptions past that point for “the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.” Since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade,  voters have favored expanding abortion rights in all the states that introduced abortion-related ballot measures.  But in Florida, amendments need 60% or more approval to pass — a high threshold that worries activists here.  In swing states like   and  , voters have backed abortion rights at the ballot by less than 57%. Berrios and other activists point out that Florida, a larger state with double the population size, requires more volunteers and resources to educate voters about ballot measures and convince them to turn out to vote.  The state has also tilted right in recent years and is no longer considered a swing state, making it more difficult to convince voters who see this as a partisan and not a health-care issue, some activists say. Andrea Mercado, executive director of Florida Rising, a progressive voting rights group, said she has seen an increase in foundation and donor funds to the state's nonprofit groups after the ballot initiative was approved, but “the budget isn’t fully raised by any stretch of the imagination yet,” she said. “Florida is the third largest state in the nation, so to reach our population and to win 60% of the vote is going to require all hands on deck,” Mercado said. “And it will be expensive to make sure that 60% of voters in November vote yes on Amendment 4.” Mi Vecino, a group based in West Palm Beach with offices in Central Florida, usually focuses on Latino voters, but it has been reaching out to all voter groups in Central Florida, knocking on doors since December.  Berrios, the co-founder, said they would be canvassing in South Florida right now but lack the funds to take on the task. So far, they have knocked on about 77,000 doors to talk about the ballot measure and made a quarter-million phone calls to voters in Central and South Florida. “What we found consistently is that voters are very open to supporting this initiative,” said Berrios. “But there’s a lot of work that has to be done around it. Voters are not necessarily motivated to support it.” Among Florida Democrats they've reached out to, about 20% said they were against the amendment, while 13% were undecided — that's almost a third of Democrats who are not presently saying they support the measure. Among Republicans they spoke with, 28% say they support Amendment 4 while 25% are undecided — that's almost half of Republicans that could potentially support the measure, according to Berrios. This shows that for Amendment 4 to get 60% of the vote, the support has to cut across Democrats, Republicans and independents, he said.     Days after Florida’s six-week abortion ban went into effect, Gina Romero, an organizer with Florida Rising, a progressive voting rights group, began canvassing in Hialeah, a working-class city in Miami Dade County that is 95% Latino. A majority voted for Trump in 2020. Armed with flyers and a hat to shield the punishing sun, Romero knocked on doors and spoke to voters where about half seemed to support the measure and the other half did not. Many people weren’t home and Romero left a flyer at their door with information. “We are Catholic. We don’t believe in abortion,” said Maria Luisa Benitez, a retired agricultural engineer, as she discussed Amendment 4 with Romero at her doorstep, her dogs barking in the background. Benitez did agree there should be certain exceptions to abortion restrictions when a woman's health is endangered.  Down the block, Doris Saldá, 68, said she supports Amendment 4 and called the abortion ban “an attack on my body.” “I pay taxes and I’m law abiding. I should have the freedom to do what I want with my body,” said Saldá.Nationally, Democrats are seizing on abortion, hoping it will galvanize moderate voters, especially women, to turn out in November.  The Biden campaign often cites Democratic victories in the 2022 midterm election as examples of the issue driving voters to turn out. After Florida’s Supreme Court approved the state's six-week abortion ban, President  Joe Biden made a  , where he blamed Donald Trump for ""this nightmare"" — Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three conservative Supreme Court justices who ruled in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade.  Biden read off a list of states where voters have supported abortion rights measures and said, “This November, you can add Florida to that list.” On the day the six-week ban went into effect, Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a  , calling the measure “another Trump abortion ban.” But now that the pivotal swing state has moved further to the right in recent years, some abortion rights advocates stress the importance of seeing abortion access as a health care issue and not a Democratic issue to ensure support across all voters.    Lauren Brenzel, the campaign director of ""Yes on 4,"" which advocates for the amendment, said Floridians are used to the 60% threshold and noted that other ballot measures, like the one on the 2020 ballot to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, passed with 60% of the vote. “Floridians understand that policy can exist outside of the candidate space,” Brenzel said. “That is so important for abortion, because, unfortunately, what we see is political actors on both sides who have really taken this issue and made it a political one, when normal people think this is a health care issue.”   Berrios said that in a state like Florida, ""it’s going to come down to who delivers the most effective message, and then turns out their support. ...

Look, they were viciously attacked on October 7. They had scenes that nobody’s ever seen.”  Trump has maintained similar aggressive messaging about Israel’s military efforts, routinely saying at campaign rallies that Israel has to “finish the job.” He has also claimed that the Israel-Hamas war would have never happened if he were still in the White House because of his relationships with foreign leaders.   “Well, I said they should get the job over with fast, fast, they’ll have to make their own solution, but they have to get this job over with fast and get it done because the world is blowing up around them.

153,Sports,"Diego Maradona’s Golden Ball trophy from the 1986 World Cup has resurfaced. The award, which had been missing for decades, will be auctioned in Paris next month, the Aguttes house said Tuesday. Maradona,   at age 60, was awarded the trophy for his scintillating play at the tournament, where he captained Argentina in its 3-2 win over West Germany in the final in Mexico City. Before that, he scored the controversial “Hand of God” goal and the “Goal of the Century” in a 2-1 win over England in the quarterfinals. The auction house said it expects the trophy “to fetch millions due to its uniqueness.” Maradona received the award — given to the tournament’s best player — at a ceremony at the Lido cabaret on the Champs-Élysées in 1986. It subsequently disappeared, giving rise to rumors. Some say it was lost during a wild poker game, or sold to pay off debts, Aguttes said. Others said Maradona had stored it in a safe in a Naples bank that was robbed by local gangsters in 1989, when he played in the Italian league. According to the story told by a reformed member of the mafia, the trophy was then melted down into gold pieces. “A far-fetched theory, given that it was made of a gold-copper alloy,” Aguttes said in its auction catalogue. Aguttes said the trophy reappeared in 2016 among other lots that were acquired from a private collection at auction in Paris. “It was thoroughly investigated and authenticated as Diego Maradona’s Adidas Golden Ball trophy,” Aguttes said. The “Hand of God” goal came when Maradona punched the ball into England’s net for his team’s opener. Maradona was also a magician with the ball at his feet and four minutes later, he weaved through England’s midfield and defense and then past goalkeeper Peter Shilton for what FIFA later declared the greatest goal in World Cup history. “To say that this World Cup had it all would be an understatement ... it was also, and above all, the tournament where Diego Maradona really showed the world what he could do with his feet, and even with his hands,” said François Thierry, a sports expert at Aguttes. Bidders will be asked to make a deposit of 150,000 euros ($161,000) to participate in the June 6 auction.

154,Sports,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — A Malaysian international footballer has been splashed by acid and two other top players were attacked within a week by unknown assailants, in a rare outbreak of violence targeting athletes in the country. Police criminal investigation chief Mohamad Shuhaily Mohamad Zain said Wednesday that there were similarities in the three attacks and that the victims appeared to have been targeted. But investigators have not determined whether the cases were linked. Faisal Halim, who plays as a winger for the national team and Malaysian club Selangor, was hospitalized with fourth-degree burns following an acid attack by two assailants at a shopping mall on Sunday. He was reported to be in critical but stable condition, with limited movement and speech. Just three days earlier, another prominent national team player, Akhyar Rashid, was assaulted in a robbery outside his house in eastern Terengganu state after his return from training. He was hit with an iron rod, leaving him head and leg injuries. His attackers fled after taking money from him. Late Tuesday, former national team captain Safiq Rahim was tailed by two assailants on a motorbike after a training session in southern Johor state. They later threatened him with a hammer and smashed his car’s rear window but he was not physically hurt. “Our investigations also showed that the players involved were tailed prior to the attacks. The perpetrators also worked in pairs in all the attacks,” Shuhaily, the investigation chief, was quoted as saying by English-language daily The Star. Two people were initially detained over Faisal’s attack, but one was later released. Shuhaily said police were studying the possibility that the attacks could be linked to a recent letter sent to the Malaysian soccer federation (FAM) accusing it of mismanagement of funds, bribery and fraud.

It also got Jason Kelce and his brother, Travis Kelce, thinking about who they would want to roast them if the opportunity presented itself. “If I was picking who to roast me, I would pick people that like I would have no problem getting into a fistfight with, like family members,” Jason Kelce said on the May 8 episode of their  . However, he drew the line at one person very close to him — his wife,  . “The one person I wouldn’t allow on the stage is Kylie because she knows way too much,” he said. “Cannot allow that.” “I mean, every day I’m getting roasted by Kylie. I don’t need her to go up on stage and do that,” he added. Travis Kelce, meanwhile, had a list of people that’d he be more than willing to fire zingers at him. “Well, Santino’s one of my favorite comedians of all time and I think he would f------ deliver,” he said, possibly referring to Andrew Santino, who   on “New Heights.” “Dave Chappelle is the all-time great. Kevin Hart. I would love Kevin to go up there and just f------ rip me in half,” Travis Kelce continued before praising Hart for the work he did on Brady’s roast. He also mentioned Nikki Glaser, who   for her performance at Brady’s roast. “Nikki Glaser’s f------ hilarious. If I did a roast, you would have to get Nikki up there,” Travis Kelce said. Travis Kelce also singled out well-known roaster Jeff Ross, who had one joke at the roast that viewers speculated might have  . “I met Jeff Ross out in L.A. at one of the Comedy Stores out there,” he said. “Yeah, he actually hosts roast battles between comics and I was able to kind of be a part of and judge one of them and had a f------ blast with him,” he said. “So it’d be an honor to get roasted by Jeff but yeah, maybe that day will come.” As for the Brady roast itself (which featured the seven-time Super Bowl champ  ), Travis Kelce was impressed, saying it was “unbelievable.” “Everybody involved, hats off,” he said. “I’ve been in tears the whole last day, just watching the clips and everything. I wasn’t able to actually watch it live,” Travis Kelce continued. “But I tell you this man, I commend everybody because nobody seemed to get their feelings hurt. It just looked like everybody was having fun with it. But at the same time, man, that s--- had me rolling.” Jason Kelce echoed the sentiment, although he isn’t exactly onboard with the idea of a roast. “It was pure entertainment and I’m really happy they did it, but I just do not get the roasts. I don’t understand why people do them. Maybe I take myself too seriously,” he said. Jason Kelce said it was fun to watch and see the turnout. “The best part about was how many just iconic NFL and celebrities, just of immense stature that were there.

156,Sports,"A northern Idaho prosecutor won’t bring hate crime charges against an 18-year-old accused of during the NCAA Tournament. The deputy attorney for the city of Coeur d’Alene made the announcement on Monday, writing in a charging decision document that though the use of the slur was “detestable” and “incredibly offensive,” there wasn’t evidence suggesting that the man was threatening physical harm to the women or to their property. That means the conduct is protected by the First Amendment and can’t be charged under Idaho’s malicious harassment law, Ryan Hunter wrote. The members of the University of Utah basketball team were staying at a Coeur d’Alene hotel in March as they competed at the NCAA Tournament in nearby Spokane, Washington. Team members were walking from a hotel to a restaurant when they said a truck drove up and the driver yelled a racist slur at the group. After the team left the restaurant, the same driver returned and was “reinforced by others,” revving their engines and yelling again at the players, said Tony Stewart, an official with the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations, during a news conference shortly after the event. The encounters were so disturbing that they left the group concerned about their safety, Utah coach Lynne Roberts said a few days later. Far-right extremists have maintained a presence in the region for years. In 2018, at least nine hate groups operated in the region of Spokane and northern Idaho, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. “We had several instances of some kind of racial hate crimes toward our program and (it was) incredibly upsetting for all of us,” Roberts said. “In our world, in athletics and in university settings, it’s shocking. There’s so much diversity on a college campus and so you’re just not exposed to that very often.” University of Utah officials declined to comment about the prosecutor’s decision on Wednesday. In the document detailing the decision, Hunter said police interviewed nearly two dozen witnesses and pored over hours of surveillance video. Several credible witnesses described a racist slur being hurled at the group as they walked to dinner, but their descriptions of the vehicle and the person who shouted the slur varied, and police weren’t able to hear any audio of the yelling on the surveillance tapes. There also wasn’t any evidence to connect the encounter before the team arrived at the restaurant with what happened as they left, Hunter, wrote. Still, police were able to identify the occupants of a silver passenger vehicle involved in the second encounter, and one of them — an 18-year-old high school student — reportedly confessed to shouting a slur and an obscene statement at the group, Hunter said. Prosecutors considered whether to bring three possible charges against the man — malicious harassment, disorderly conduct or disturbing the peace — but decided they didn’t have enough evidence to support any of the three charges. That’s because Idaho’s hate crime law only makes racial harassment a crime if it is done with the intent to either threaten or cause physical harm to a person or to their property. The man who shouted the slur told police he did it because he thought it would be funny, Hunter wrote. “Setting aside the rank absurdity of that claim and the abjectly disgusting thought process required to believe it would be humorous to say something that abhorrent,” it undermines the premise that the man had the specific intent to intimidate and harass, Hunter wrote. The hateful speech also didn’t meet the requirements of Idaho’s disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace laws, which are mainly about when and where noise or unruly behavior occurs. The slurs were shouted on a busy thoroughfare during the early evening hours, and so the noise level wasn’t unusual for that time and place. Hunter wrote that his office shares in the outrage sparked by the man’s “abhorrently racist and misogynistic statement, and we join in unequivocally condemning that statement and the use of a racial slur in this case, or in any circumstance. However that cannot, under current law, form the basis for criminal prosecution in this case.” The Associated Press",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/no-hate-crime-charges-filed-man-yelled-racist-slurs-utah-womens-basket-rcna151332,NBC,No hate crime charges filed against man who yelled racist slurs at Utah women’s basketball team,2
157,Sports,"WNBA star and Olympian Brittney Griner writes that she felt she was being used as a “pawn” by Russian President Vladimir Putin when she was arrested and imprisoned just weeks before he invaded Ukraine in 2022. The Phoenix Mercury star’s memoir “Coming Home,” which debuted Tuesday at No. 1 on Amazon’s best-sellers list, lays out in detail the events leading up to her arrest, the challenges of her nearly 10-month detainment in some of Russia’s most notorious penal colonies, the agony of waiting to be released — and so much more, all in 300 pages. In one section, she describes the experience of being a Black gay woman in a Russian prison under Putin.  “Black lives matter,” Griner wrote. “We hear that in the streets, but what is a Black life really worth? Judging by our history, it seems not much, and even less if you’re gay. For Putin, my worth was as a pawn. My arrest gave him leverage in his clash with the West. He was well aware of America’s long history of racial tensions, and he knew how to use that to his benefit.” In February 2022, Griner traveled to Russia to play her eighth season in the country’s women’s basketball league. She was arrested after two vials of cannabis oil, totaling less than a gram, were found in her luggage at the airport in Moscow. She pleaded guilty to drug charges and was   to nine years in prison.  Griner wrote that she was distressed about having disappointed her closely knit family and Black people in general.  When the news of her arrest broke, Griner wrote: “I cried because I’d let down my father. The Griner name was now stained around the globe: dopehead, drug dealer, dumb. I hurt because I knew I’d handed the world a weapon. When you’re Black, your behavior is never just about you. It’s about your entire community.”  Though she said she wears her Blackness with pride, Griner said she felt as though her actions “shamed my people.” “Blackness doesn’t make you less, but it does frame your life,” she wrote. “When you walk into a room, so does race. Frankly, it shows up before you do. It colors every conversation, shapes how you’re viewed, determines whether you’re even heard. From the day you get here, Blackness hangs over everything, from comments about your hair (‘Can I touch it?’) to mentions that certain Black people are ‘smart’ (’cause it’s assumed we’re idiots). The message comes through loud and clear: You’re not one of us, you’re less.” It was so bad that Griner  in the early days of incarceration. She wrote that she’d spend her nights “listing ways I could end my misery.” She thought better of it. And after many sleepless nights, she stopped caring about the freezing temperatures, that her long legs dangled off the mattress and that the bed springs poked into her body. “I was a legit zombie,” she said.   By the time Griner was allowed to shower there, she was shocked at the repulsive conditions, but knew she had to get in the water.  “In the WNBA, my teammates and I joked about the prison showers — a big space with spouts spread around. This was the real thing,” she wrote. “It was nasty, exposed pipes on every wall. Long hair strands all over the tile floor and gathered in the drains. A bloody tampon was tucked between two pipes. As much as I was disgusted by the scene, I was just as repulsed by my stench.” Correctional Colony No. 1, also known as IK-1, is a former orphanage converted into a prison about 50 miles from Moscow, which would take about two hours to drive in Russia’s notorious traffic. Griner had spent the time being transported there handcuffed, with her 6-foot-9 frame folded in the back of a vehicle not equipped for someone her height. She was also deeply afraid, not knowing what to expect, but knowing that where she was headed was no place anyone would want to be. When there, she received myriad instructions before making it to the shower.  “I undressed and found the cleanest part of the floor,” she wrote. “I turned the faucet on, and rusty brown water came spouting out.” Once she got over the color, “hot water felt so good on my skin. I closed my eyes tight, trying to forget where I was. I thought of Relle [her wife] and home and all I had left behind. Down the water slid from my dreads onto the floor splashing away the hell I endured. I stayed in there a good 30 minutes until I banged on the door for the guard to let me out. That was the nastiest shower I’d ever taken. It was also the best.” She wrote about her increased fear when transferred to an even more notorious labor camp, Correctional Colony No. 2 or IK-2, 300 miles east of Moscow. It was known for “horrid conditions, hard labor and inmate torture,” Griner wrote. And temperatures that dipped to 5 below zero.  “When I entered IK-2, I flipped a switch in my head.  , I told myself.” She worked all day, making military uniforms, shoveling snow, breaking up ice.  At IK-2, “I had been frozen, sick, got my hair chopped off. The girl I was lay on a heap of dreads on a concrete floor. … At a labor camp in Russia in the dead of winter, I learned how tough I was.”  Tough, but battered. The experience left her with bouts of “depression, with long stretches of silence and heartache.” One thing that helped her push through the depression and realities of incarceration, she said, were the uplifting letters from family and friends, as well as the mail she received from strangers. Now that she’s returned to the U.S., she’s back to playing for the Mercury. She’s also seeing a therapist.  The Biden administration negotiated a trade for : Griner would be released in exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, known as the “Merchant of Death.” Before freedom, she experienced one last humiliation: Russian guards ordering her to strip naked as they took photos.  “I didn’t cover my privates, nor did I cower or tremble,” she wrote. “I sense they expected me to fall apart. ... I stood tall. . . I felt like weeping, but I had no tears left.”  She wrote that she keeps one remaining vow: “I will not rest until Paul Whelan is released,” she said of the former Marine who has been detained in Russia since 2018 on accusations of spying. The U.S. denies the charges.

158,Sports,"Denver Nuggets star Nikola Jokic was named the NBA’s Most Valuable Player on Wednesday.  Jokic, who also took home the honor in 2021 and 2022, is just the ninth player in league history to claim three MVP awards. The only others since 1990: Michael Jordan and LeBron James.  The Serbian big man averaged 26.4 points, 12.4 rebounds and 9 assists a game this season while shooting 58.3% from the field.  Jokic, 29, got 79 first-place votes, while fellow finalists Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder and Luka Doncic of the Dallas Mavericks got 15 and four, respectively.  Jokic is one of the most unusual players ever to compete in the NBA. At 6-foot-11 and 284 pounds, he has the size, length and strength to back opponents down in the post but also a soft shooting touch to hit from midrange and outside the arc. He also has exceptional ball-handling and passing ability for a center, making him the quintessential modern big man. He finished the 2023-24 season fifth in total points, third in total rebounds, second in total assists and eighth in total steals. Jokic is the only player in NBA history to rank in the top 10 in all four categories in a single season since the league began keeping statistics on steals in 1973-74.  The Nuggets — the defending NBA champions — finished the regular season second in the Western Conference behind the Thunder. Denver is down 0-2 in its postseason series with the Minnesota Timberwolves.  “There are a lot of players that deserve it,” Jokic said on TNT after the announcement. “It’s probably the details and small things … but we lost two games at home to Minnesota. Tomorrow we leave to [go to] Minnesota to try to get the series back to Denver.” Shaquille O’Neal said on the broadcast that Gilgeous-Alexander deserved the honor. He averaged 30.1 points, 6.2 assists and 5.5 rebounds while leading Oklahoma City to the best record in the conference.  “I don’t like to rain on people’s parades, but I’m not happy with this one. ...

159,Sports,"INDIANAPOLIS — Indianapolis police announced Wednesday they’ve opened an investigation into an “NBA player and citizen” altercation that happened at Gainbridge Fieldhouse on the night Bucks guard  in the final minutes of   to the Pacers. Police said in a news release the case has been forwarded to detectives, “who are currently investigating this situation and take all accusations seriously.” Detectives will present the case to the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office at the conclusion of the investigation, the release stated. Cameras showed Beverley sitting on the bench and tossing a ball into the stands, hitting a fan in the head with about 2 ½ minutes left in the game on May 2. After a different fan threw the ball back to Beverley, who was holding his arm out for it, the Bucks guard fired it back at that spectator. Beverley spoke about his behavior on an episode of “The Pat Bev Podcast” that was released Wednesday. He said he was called a word that he’d never been called before, but added that his own actions were “still inexcusable.” “I will be better,” he said. “I have to be better, and I will be better. That should have never happened. Regardless of what was said, that should have never happened. Simple as that.” Beverley added the atmosphere in Indiana “was great” aside from “a handful of fans” who crossed the line. The Pacers beat the Bucks 120-98, eliminating Milwaukee from the playoffs. “I ain’t bringing a basketball on the bench no more,” Beverley said. “That … threw my whole vibe off.” After the game, Beverley wouldn’t allow ESPN journalist Malinda Adams to ask him a question in a group interview in the locker room. He said it was because she didn’t subscribe to his podcast. Beverley told her to get her microphone out of his face and then eventually asked her to leave the interview circle. On his podcast Wednesday, Beverley said he had asked that of reporters who interviewed him ever since he launched his podcast. Beverley said he told Adams that “it was never my intent to disrespect you.” A day after the loss, Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Beverley’s behavior was “not the Milwaukee way or the Bucks way.” “We’re better than that,” Rivers said. “Pat feels awful about that. He also understands emotionally — this is an emotional game and things happen — unfortunately, you’re judged immediately and he let the emotions get the better of him.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/milwaukee-bucks-patrick-beverley-police-investigating-rcna151400,NBC,Police investigating after Milwaukee Bucks player Patrick Beverley threw ball at fan,2

Mizuhara was an employee of Ohtani's former team, the Los Angeles Angels, but Ohtani ""paid him separately for the additional work of driving him to meetings and interpreting for non-baseball-related activities,"" prosecutors said.
