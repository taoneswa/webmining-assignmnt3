https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/29/jennifer-arcuri-pursuing-vendetta-say-friends-boris-johnson/,politics,"Jennifer Arcuri is pursuing a “vendetta” against Boris Johnson, friends of the Prime Minister alleged on Monday night, as Downing Street insisted he had done nothing wrong. Mr Johnson’s   has resurfaced after she gave a series of embarrassing interviews to a tabloid newspaper, including revealing details of text messages and even releasing a ‘selfie’ photograph taken in his kitchen. Ms Arcuri, 36, claimed she had sex with Mr Johnson, then London’s mayor, on the sofa of the family home he shared with his now   in March 2016. Ms Arcuri also claims she sent him a topless photograph, which prompted Mr Johnson to reply in a text message that it was “enough to make a bishop kick through a stained-glass window”. The affair, which began in 2012 and ended in 2016, is currently subject to an investigation by the Greater London Assembly’s oversight committee over Mr Johnson’s failure to declare the relationship. Ms Arcuri, an American entrepreneur living in London at the time, was granted access to trade mission events and received funding from London & Partners, a company funded in part by the London mayor’s office to promote the city. However, on Monday night friends of Mr Johnson questioned Ms Arcuri’s motives in telling her story to the Sunday Mirror and Daily Mirror four years after their affair ended. It is understood she has received a sizeable sum for an old-fashioned “kiss and tell”. An ally of the Prime Minister said: “There is no doubt in my mind that Boris is guilty of a monumental lapse in taste. At what point is the hawking of a story that is three years old cease to be news and start to look like a vendetta.” Another friend suggested the relationship was only sporadic during those four years because Mr Johnson was “too busy” to have a sustained affair while still married and working as London’s mayor.  The friend questioned Ms Arcuri’s motive in taking the ‘selfie’ in the kitchen and then keeping it, along with text messages, for years afterwards. The friend said: “Is it really credible that Boris was rushing off for an afternoon bonk with this woman for four years? It seems incredible. I don’t think it could be on the scale she is claiming. “His aides knew where he was more or less the whole time. She [Arcuri] has obviously thought how she can maximise this for her own gain. You can’t blame her, but she has saved that photo and texts for years and then just waited.” The prospect of an inquiry could push Mr Johnson into the embarrassing position of having to defend his affair at a public hearing. The Telegraph understands that the London Assembly committee will write to him, probably after the mayoral elections in May, asking why he did not declare his relationship, confidentially at least, which would have allowed him to could keep the matter secret from his wife and family. If the committee is unhappy with his written responses, it could demand that he gives evidence in public. Sources said Ms Arcuri’s latest claims, made in the newspapers, were sufficient to trigger a new stage in the investigation. Len Duvall, the chair of the oversight committee, said in a statement: ""Our investigation will consider whether Boris Johnson conducted himself in a way that’s expected from anyone in that position. It’s important we get those answers, because Londoners deserve to have their politicians held accountable."" The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said in 2020 that there would not be a criminal inquiry into whether “Mr Johnson used his position while Mayor of London to benefit and reward American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri”. The IOPC said there was no evidence that Mr Johnson had “influenced the payment of any sponsorship monies to Ms Arcuri” or that he had “influenced or played an active part in securing her participation in trade missions”. But the IOPC said that under the broader  , “it would have been wise for Mr Johnson to have declared this as a conflict of interest, and a failure to do so could have constituted a breach of these broader principles”. Asked whether the Prime Minister would assist the GLA inquiry, his press secretary Allegra Stratton said: “He will engage, but this was already being looked at in detail by no less an authority than the Independent Office for Police Conduct. ""It found that these claims were untrue and unfounded. This was looked at in depth and it was found there was no case to answer. “The Prime Minister follows the Nolan Principles in conducting himself in public life.” Ms Stratton refused to say if he would give evidence in person if requested. She added: ""The work has been done, public time and money and effort has been spent looking into whether there has been any wrongdoing, and it was found that the Prime Minister, the then-London mayor, has no case to answer.""   Another friend of Mr Johnson’s added: “Given all the stuff that was written before at a moment of heightened political interest ... you would have thought they would have been able to make it stick before. Does the general public really give a toss? It’s not as though he’s ever tried to be whiter than white.""",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/02/02/ursula-von-der-leyen-wont-quit-astrazeneca-vaccine-row/,politics,"Ursula von der Leyen has no plans to quit after last week’s coronavirus vaccine fiasco, despite suffering the worst week of her career as president of the European Commission.  Today she  for the vaccine fiasco and instead urged Europeans to judge her in three years time at the end of her term in office.  She is facing unprecedented criticism across the EU after her gaffe-strewn handling of the row with AstraZeneca.  Brussels’ threat to  , and the slow roll-out of vaccinations across the bloc have increased the pressure on the former German defence minister.  As far as Mrs von der Leyen, who has   commissioner and is accused of centralising all power in her small circle of trusted advisors, is concerned she is going nowhere.  In truth, there is little political appetite in the European Parliament, which can remove a commission president, or in EU capitals for Mrs von der Leyen to go.  The European Commission is playing an important role in the procurement of vaccines and the coordination of coronavirus measures among the member states.  Defenestrating its president now, with the pandemic raging and a massive economic stimulus package to be rolled out, is still seen as self-defeating.  It would trigger a long process to replace her and, possibly the whole college of commissioner, which would cost valuable time.  There is no ready made replacement waiting in the wings and, even if they had the power to force her out, member states were responsible for appointing her in the first place and won’t want to publicise their error. A fragmented European Parliament approved Mrs von der Leyen with a majority of just nine votes and the fiasco has cost her some support, which could impact her ability to get EU law passed.  It is true that those EU governments less enamoured of Brussels overreach would welcome having a lame duck commission president in place.  Both EU governments and the European Parliament will also be keen to avoid a clash over the method used to choose the president.  EU leaders, led by Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, ditched the Spitzenkandidat system, which tied the results of the European elections to the top job. Much to the fury of the European Parliament, they returned to the summit stitch-ups that had chosen all commission presidents except Jean-Claude Juncker.  Promises were made to return to the failed experiment in democracy in the future, which even the frequently supine MEPs would insist upon if Mrs von der Leyen was to go.  Any British politician who faced  would be expected to at least consider their position or quit, as Theresa May did.  Resignations in response to failure have sadly fallen out of fashion in Westminster but have rarely been à la mode in Brussels, the de facto capital of the European Union.  The sole president of the European Commission to fall on his sword was Jacques Santer, who resigned in 1999 before he was removed by MEPs amid a corruption scandal  Jean-Claude Juncker stayed resolutely in post when the beginning of his presidency was engulfed by the Luxleaks scandal, which exposed his role in Luxembourg’s sweetheart tax deals with multinationals.  To British observers it may appear incredible that Mrs von der Leyen will survive her botched handling of the pandemic.  But while Europe’s capitals, grateful for a scapegoat for their own national failings in the pandemic, are more than happy to drag her over the coals, there is no political appetite to replace her. ""In this crisis the commission saw a chance for itself to act as a government but governments sometimes step down when things go wrong or at least are held accountable by their parliaments,"" one EU diplomat said.  ""Having said that, member states have allowed them to do this because they are too busy managing their own crisis.""",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/01/29/owen-paterson-agony-wifes-suicide-horrifying-think-suffering/,politics,"When the police told Owen Paterson his wife Rose had been found   of their Shropshire home, his last desperate hope was that she had been murdered. “In some ways that would have been easier to process than suicide,” admits the former cabinet minister. “That is how terrible suicide is for those left behind. It is just so hard to comprehend how someone could be so desperate that they feel this is the only way out. “Here we are, seven months on, and it’s absolutely horrifying to think that Rose was also suffering so badly without us knowing. “I miss her so much, and so often find myself on the point of calling her, as if she is still with us. The fact that we’ll never speak again is nothing short of devastating.""  The pain is etched on the veteran politician’s face as he describes how he can no longer listen to the Mozart that was played at their 1980 wedding, or Cockney Rebel, the Steve Harley song that provided the soundtrack to their days together at the University of Cambridge in the Seventies. But it is seeing their 21-month-old granddaughter, Sylvie, that brings home the  , which affects 16 families in Britain every single day.  “Rose will never see her first daubed paintings, she will never go to her first school play. It's just so desperately sad.” Owen, who has been the MP for North Shropshire for 23 years, has decided to speak candidly about Rose’s death for the first time to a national newspaper in the hope that it will help others. “If I can help stop just one family from experiencing the utter agony we have gone through, then I will have done something worthwhile,” insists the former environment and Northern Ireland secretary. With his sons Felix, 34, Ned, 32 and daughter Evie, 28, Owen is poised to launch The Rose Paterson Trust, a charity dedicated to raising money for  , suicide bereavement and projects promoting mental and physical health. The Trust has recently been awarded charitable status and will be officially unveiled on the day of the Grand National on April 10, in honour of Rose, who was chairman of Aintree Racecourse.  The Grand National has always been a big day for the family, but this year they hope that it will enable them to do some real good in Rose’s memory. “Rose was such a kind and caring person by nature,” said Owen. “We know she would want us to help others. She did so much for charity herself. We just want to make her proud.” Owen had no idea that his beloved wife of 40 years was feeling suicidal in the days before she was found dead in the early hours of June 24, his 64th birthday. When she did not answer his telephone calls from the House of Commons on the morning she went missing, he did not think anything of it.  As well as her work with Aintree and as a Steward of the Jockey Club, Rose would often be out and about, too busy to respond to messages.  But when calls to their home near Ellesmere continued to go unanswered at 6pm that evening, Owen began to worry. “I wasn’t entirely surprised she hadn’t got back to me because she would often be out in the garden or at Aintree. “But she’d nearly always be back by the evening because she was very punctilious about keeping on top of emails.” After another couple of hours went by with no word from Rose, Ned, who was the last person to see her the previous evening, watching a TV documentary on Persian history, raised the alarm. By 8.15pm, Owen had called the police. “That’s when the whole nightmare began,” he recalls. As more and more neighbours joined the effort to find Rose, he jumped in the car with Felix, who lives in south London, and immediately drove to Shropshire. Throughout the 200-mile journey north, they were in constant communication with Ned.  “We went through everything over and over: heart attack, stroke, some respiratory collapse. Had she slipped and banged her head on a rock? Had a branch fallen on her head? We had all these crazy ideas. We never, ever thought of suicide.” Arriving home as a helicopter circled overhead, the lead police officer on the case walked straight up to Owen and asked him a question he will never forget. “Looking back, he knew exactly what he was looking for,” Owen concedes. “He said, ‘Mr Paterson, does your wife suffer from depression?’ Irritated, Owen dismissed the idea and stressed the urgency of finding his wife alive.  “I said: ‘Please, I'm really worried, it’s been a really hot June day, she'll be out there dehydrating’.” By then it was half past midnight. “We could see them with their torches working the wood very methodically. We did hear some shouting and then the shouting stopped.  “At around 4am, the Police called us into the kitchen and said they’d found a female body and the appearance conformed to Rose Paterson.” At that point Owen demanded that Rose’s body not be taken down until he had had the chance to see her for a final time. “I hoped it would be anything but suicide. But when I went down there, it was quite obvious that she’d killed herself.” He then had to break the horrendous news to the couple’s daughter, Evie, 28, who was on holiday in France, awaiting Rose’s arrival the following day. West Mercia police later informed the family that Rose had been searching suicide websites a fortnight before, at seven in the morning.  “People say, ‘Oh you mustn’t beat yourself up' but of course I beat myself up every single day,” said Owen. The timing, on his birthday, only added to the family’s sense of bewilderment. Rose had been planning to travel to London that day to see an aunt who had just come out of lockdown, before organising a birthday dinner for Owen and then travelling out to France. She was also chairing a virtual meeting at Aintree.     “All the papers are still on her desk,” said Owen. “I just can’t bear to move them. “What is utterly tragic is that Rose's career was really blossoming. She’d done wonderful work at Aintree on animal welfare and making it more inclusive to women and families. She was doing some terrific stuff for Park Palace Ponies, an inner-city riding school in Toxteth."" Although the inquest into Rose’s death in  , she had not been on any medication for several years. “The coroner answers the who, what, when, where, how questions but never the why,"" said Owen. ""We will never definitively know why.” The couple had been under some pressure since the last general election, following a number of press reports about Owen’s external consultancy work. There had also been criticism of the racing industry for allowing the  . Owen believes them both catching Covid-19 at the beginning of the first lockdown may have had an impact on Rose’s mental health. “Rose didn’t like being ill and with the family at home she rallied round and seemed to get better far sooner than I did. “But ongoing research into the virus shows that, while it has a bigger, physical effect on men, women are disproportionately affected neurologically. Some it seems have had mini strokes and others behavioural changes.” He also blames the suicide websites she secretly visited for “drawing her in”. “Many of these suicides are on impulse. The narrative these sites use is so beguiling and it's written in such calm language.  “Yet these sites never talk about the damage on those you leave behind.” Citing evidence which suggests every suicide affects 135 people, he adds: “I feel quite strongly that if she had known the utter catastrophe she's brought on herself and many people – not just immediate family – she wouldn’t have done it. “Every suicide is unnecessary. Every suicide is avoidable. “The utter tragedy of this is Rose – a wonderful woman who everyone loved so very much – has lost her life and our lives have been changed forever.” Owen’s first Christmas in more than four decades without Rose passed in a “blur” with him spending two freezing cold hours at her grave side at the family home.  “I just wanted to be next to her,"" he said. ""I played Schubert and Mahler and stuff that she loved.” The daughter of the 4th Viscount Ridley, who was brought up on the Blagdon Estate in Northumberland, Rose had a fierce intellect and an unparalleled knowledge of horses.  “I miss her brain,"" said Owen. ""I had a second brain. She was incredibly well read and she kept me up to date on stuff. I can already feel all my racing knowledge slipping away because she's not here.” Admitting he had no previous experience of suicide, he is now trying to educate himself to help others. “If one person reading this, just one person, thinks twice about taking their own life, then it will be worth it. “Society has this image of someone who is caricatured as depressed, whose life has gone badly wrong. Rose was anxious but I wouldn't say she was depressed. “So if anyone reading this knows someone who is anxious, then please just talk to them. You may well be saving their life.""",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/29/raise-school-starting-age-seven-scottish-lib-dems-argue/,politics,"Children in Scotland should start school at the age of seven rather than four or five, the Scottish Liberal Democrats have insisted in a “radical” new proposal. As the first full week of campaigning for the Holyrood elections began, party leader Willie Rennie said delaying the age children start school will help give youngsters a “flying start”. It comes as Nicola Sturgeon promised to   if the SNP is re-elected in May, despite failing to meet her previous pledge of closing the education attainment gap between rich and poor pupils.  Focusing on their plans for education, the Lib Dems hailed the plan as a ""historical, radical and positive change"" in Scotland's school system. They want youngsters to have a ""truly play-based education"" up to the age of seven - when more formal schooling would begin. The expanded early years education would be mandatory, they stressed, and would focus on areas such as child development, social skills and outdoor learning, as well as physical and mental health. Mr Rennie said: ""Scottish Liberal Democrats will introduce a truly play-based education until age seven, to give every child a flying start. ""By learning together through play, children develop the skills needed for trickier tasks and are better prepared to shine in areas like literacy and numeracy."" He continued: ""The UK is almost unique in Europe in expecting children as young as four or five to begin formal schooling. By the age of nine, pupils in Finland have much higher reading levels than pupils in the UK, having started at the age of seven."" Mr Rennie pledged his party would also ""immediately abolish the national testing of four- and five-year-olds introduced by the SNP and heavily criticised by teachers"". Speaking about the standardised assessments, he said that parliament voted to halt them “years ago” but was “ignored”. ""The SNP claimed the support of world-leading experts for the controversial policy, only for those same experts to call it a 'perverse misrepresentation' of their work and conclude the tests were 'completely useless'."" Responding to the pledge, an SNP spokesperson said: ""We recognise that there is a debate to be had and agree 5 and 6 year olds should have 'play-based' education.  ""That’s what primaries do now and, given there is no consensus on increasing age, we do not currently support changing.""",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/28/boris-johnson-urged-consider-lifting-work-home-guidance-next/,politics,"Conservative MPs are calling on Boris Johnson to consider lifting   from next month to help quicken an economic rebound  . They argue that with more than half the adult population having  , those who want to return to the office should be allowed to do so. While a detailed Government   has been published, clarity on when people will no longer be advised to work at home if possible is yet to emerge. It is being looked at as part of review of  , with changes expected to come in at June 17 at the earliest. Steve Baker, the deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown-sceptic Tory MPs, told The Telegraph: ""If we don't end working from home then the businesses dependent on offices full of people will be in existential difficulty. That's why Boris Johnson should follow the data and get us back to the office as soon as is safe and feasible. ""With the vulnerable vaccinated and the link between hospitalisations and deaths now broken, I would have thought the Prime Minister should be exploring April 12 for a return to offices."" Another senior Tory backbencher said: ""My general view is that if the data stays good and improves then things should be accelerated. I don't take the view that people should be forced to go back to the office. I'd expect we'll have a much more hybrid arrangement. I think that people should be free to go back to the office."" Both Mr Johnson and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, have recently indicated that they expect many people who have been working from home  . Working from home fatigue appears to be setting in, with a 20 percentage point rise in the number of people planning on returning to the office. A study by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) found that workers could return to offices faster than expected as a result of the success of the vaccine rollout. It found that in the three months to February 80 per cent of employees now wanted to head back once the pandemic is over, up from fewer than 60 per cent in the previous quarter. An RCS report said this change in perceptions may be attributed to ""the speed of  , with more people now seemingly expecting a faster return to normal life than previously anticipated"". Kath Fontana, the RICS president and a facilities management specialist, said: ""We've all recognised that workplaces will need to adapt as a result of Covid-19, but it's very revealing that this latest survey shows much more optimism on the return to the office. ""What we've seen is employers using this time to look forward to and plan ahead for what the 'new normal' will look like. Effective facilities management will be even more crucial as we build back from this pandemic – the positive sentiment expressed by our professionals on the ground in this survey is light at the end of this dark tunnel.""",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/01/15-million-fewer-scots-would-have-vaccinated-snp-demand-join/,politics,"More than 1.5 million fewer Scots would have been vaccinated under the SNP's plan to join the shambolic EU programme, the Scottish Tory leader has disclosed as he hailed the ""incredible success"" of the UK roll-out. Douglas Ross said the roll-out demonstrated the overwhelming benefits of Scotland remaining part of the United Kingdom, with around 2.5 million people having now received their first dose. If   was applied to Scotland, he said this figure would have been only 877,952 and this exposed another ""glaring weakness"" in the nationalist case for separation. Speaking ahead of an election campaign event in which he will set out his NHS spending pledges for the next parliament, Mr Ross said: ""“The SNP are in denial about how much worse off we would be if they had got their way and we were left out of the world-leading UK vaccine scheme."" A series of Ms Sturgeon's ministers demanded the UK sign up to  last year and expressed outrage when Boris Johnson refused. Mike Russell, the Constitution Secretary, warned at the time: ""This idiotic refusal is all about Brexit and nothing to do with the pandemic. It will cost lives."" Maree Todd, the Children's Minister, sarcastically tweeted: ""Of course any drug company in the world who wants to sell a vaccine will definitely come to our relatively tiny market first. Of course they will."" The decision was also publicly opposed by a series of SNP MPs. Instead, the UK Government arranged for British-based AstraZeneca to partner Oxford University to develop the vaccine last year and took the gamble of pouring tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money into setting up a production line before there was any proof that the vaccine would work. Mr Johnson also put Kate Bingham, a life sciences venture capitalist, in charge of the UK's Vaccine Taskforce (VTF) and gave her wide discretion to speed up the process and lay steep bets on vaccine candidates. The VTF bought doses early from seven different candidates and has now secured deals for 407 million doses, enough to vaccinate the population many times over. According to a VTF report, joining the EU's procurement bloc would have barred the UK from making outside negotiations. The EU was months behind in signing its own deals with AstraZeneca and German company Pfizer and is now suffering severe shortages amid production problems on the Continent.  Official figures on Wednesday showed 61 deaths were registered in Scotland last week that mentioned Covid on the death certificate, a fall of five from the previous week. Scotland's Covid death toll has dropped every week since Jan 24 and deaths from all causes are below average for this time of year for the third week in a row. Thursday is the last day of the Scottish Government's ""stay at home"" order. Mr Ross said: ""The vaccination rollout has been an incredible success story across Scotland and the United Kingdom. ""My thanks go to our heroic NHS staff, volunteers in our communities and our Armed Forces who have all stepped up to deliver this astonishing achievement."" He said the Scottish Tories would ""fully"" fund the NHS over the next parliament. Pressed how many people would have been vaccinated in an independent Scotland in the EU, Ms Sturgeon admitted the UK was doing ""incredibly well"" but avoided the question by instead arguing that the country would have performed just as well without Brexit. She told ITV News: ""It would still be open to the UK to secure its own vaccines and to take the decisions it has taken."" She also argued the pandemic will only be over ""when the whole world is properly protected and properly vaccinated."" Mairi Gougeon, the SNP's Public Health Minister, said: ""While Boris Johnson apparently told his Tory MPs that the success of the vaccination roll-out is down to 'greed', we know that that isn't the case. It is down to the brilliance of our scientists and researchers, and our invaluable National Health Service.""",4

Earlier this month, Labour applied to have a description featuring its new leader’s name and an election slogan featured on ballot papers. But last week the Electoral Commission said it could not deal with the application in time for the description to be included on ballots. At a remote High Court hearing on Tuesday, Labour said refusing to include the slogan on regional list ballots would cause it ""an unfair electoral disadvantage"".

During a surprise raid over the weekend, an elite unit of Italian military police acting on EU orders  . The discovery appeared to confirm the EU's long-held suspicion that AstraZeneca was giving the UK special treatment, secretly exporting doses to its home country while failing to deliver on contracts agreed with Brussels. Yet, as EU officials  , the allegation, briefed to the Continental press, simply wasn't true. In fact, most of the doses discovered in the Italian factory were destined for the EU itself, with the remainder headed for poorer countries across the world. One former Europe minister called it possibly the ""most embarrassing day in the EU's history"". Italy's La Stampa newspaper reported that Italian officers had  , where doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine are put into vials and labelled. The raid was carried out by the NAS, an elite unit of the Carabinieri which is part of the armed forces and usually investigates criminal syndicates suspected of counterfeiting food, wine and medicines. After inspecting the company's records, the officers   – roughly half AstraZeneca's delivery shortfall to the EU. EU sources briefed the newspaper that the shipment was thought to be secretly bound for the UK, despite the company having fallen far short of its promised deliveries to the bloc.  Italian authorities ordered the raid after Thierry Breton, the EU's commissioner for the internal market, raised suspicions during a visit to an AstraZeneca factory in Leiden, the Netherlands, earlier this month.  The commission issued the alert after Mr Breton suggested the numbers provided by AstraZeneca executives did not add up, suggesting a discrepancy between the reported overall supply and the number of doses reported by individual AstraZeneca factories. The raid came weeks after the Italian government   from the same factory under the EU's new export ban rules. The explosive news of a ""hidden"" bumper cache of jabs destined for the UK was quickly picked up by newspapers across the Continent. By mid-morning, however, the story began to unravel. British Government officials quickly insisted that supplies from the Catalent factory ""haven't been coming to the UK and we are not expecting anything from there"". Mario Gargiulo, the president of European biologics for Catalent, said the inspection by the Carabinieri had found ""everything in order"". Soon afterwards,  officials in Brussels admitted that the 29 million doses were in fact destined for AstraZeneca's plant in Belgium for onward distribution around the EU. An Italian government official said: ""On Saturday, the European Commission asked the prime minister to verify several consignments of vaccine in a production plant in Anagni. ""The Prime Minister informed the minister of health, Roberto Speranza, who arranged for the inspection to be carried out between Saturday and Sunday by the Carabinieri NAS. It emerged that the inspected batches were destined for Belgium. All outgoing batches were inspected."" AstraZeneca later said 16 million of the doses were ""waiting for quality control release to be dispatched to Europe"", while the other 13 million were to go to countries in the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme for developing countries. A spokesman said there were ""no exports currently planned other than to Covax countries"", adding that it was ""incorrect to describe this as a stockpile"". ""The process of manufacturing vaccines is very complex and time-consuming. In particular, vaccine doses must wait for quality control clearance after the filling of vials is completed,"" the spokesman said. Mr Breton later told the BBC that he had asked for the raid to ensure everything was on track and it had been ""helpful to understand what was happening in Italy"". But Bruno Maçães, Portugal's former Europe minister, called it possibly ""the most embarrassing day in EU history"". ""So Italian police raids a vaccine factory at suggestion of commission to find out these are vaccines for a global initiative aimed at providing equitable access to vaccines for some of the world's poorest regions? I think we're going to need an explanation of why Italian military police burst into a vaccine factory on false grounds,"" he added. However some EU officials were refusing to give up on Wednesday night, revealing that the commission had asked AstraZeneca for additional information about where the active ingredient in the vaccine vials found in Italy had been manufactured. Brussels sources indicated that the commission suspects that some of the drug substance sent to the Italian plant for packaging could have been produced in the much-scrutinised Halix plant in the Netherlands. So far the plant has not delivered vaccine doses to the EU because it does not have authorisation from European Medicines Agency. Member state officials have questioned why the approval process has not yet been completed, while the company has insisted it is ""on track"".  On Wednesday, AstraZeneca would only say that the vaccine doses had been brought from ""outside the EU"" to be packaged at the Italian plant. Other EU officials cast doubt over the doses reported by AstraZeneca to be destined for the Covax scheme, which the EU has exempted from any export bans. One told the Financial Times of suspicions that shipments ""go to some Covax countries to then be redirected to richer countries"". However, Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU's trade commissioner, was unequivocal and said the bloc would not impose any export restrictions on Covax, which plans to distribute two billion doses to poorer and middle income countries before the end of the year.",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/womens-vote-counts-dont-women/,politics,"Women are the majority of the population, so our votes count. Obviously we are not a homogenous group. Yet increasingly I hear women voice their political homelessness. Many such women are Left-leaning and have previously voted Labour, Lib Dem or Green, but now they feel unwanted. They feel alienated – dumped by the political parties they once supported, for their refusal to discuss women’s rights under the guise that these discussions are now ‘transphobic’. The Stonewall tactic of ‘no debate’ has been highly successful. We saw it recently when Sadiq Kahn was asked by a member of the London Assembly about the definition of women he’d once put in a tweet: “You’ve said trans women are women – so do you think some women have male reproductive organs?”. Six other members of the Assembly jumped in to shut down debate and supported a subsequent motion to prevent him from having such a discussion with the mayor. His  speech was deemed discriminatory. Whether this member of the Assembly was genuinely interested in women’s rights, or just wanted to pick a fight with Khan isn’t the issue. For me, it is that respectable politicians aren’t willing to define what a woman is. And they are certainly not shy about putting definitions to other people and causes. In the latest report by the Labour Party, “ ” the aim is laudable: to increase representation of trans people in the party and make sure they can take part in all activities safely and “without fear”. It’s a shame no such consultation was ever held about protecting its female Jewish MPs, but there you go. Much of the defining of transphobia is as you would expect until you get to this: “claiming there is a ‘conflict’ between trans people’s rights and women’s or other communities is transphobic.” Herein madness lies. To ask a question or have a disagreement about single sex spaces is transphobic? The word not only becomes meaningless, it loses all contact with the real world. Ask most of us if we support trans rights and we’ll say yes, but when asked if those who have not transitioned in any meaningful way can enter single sex spaces, then the majority are unhappy or just have some questions about it. To not even have this discussion is now considered a win for lobby groups, but it is a loss to many politically active women. Lifelong activists have been threatened with expulsion from the Labour Party and told they must be “re-educated”. These are women who have set up refuges and run trade unions. Is all this a vote-winning exercise? I have heard of canvassers shouting TERF (Trans exclusionary radical feminists) at women on the doorstep when they simply asked about women’s rights. Way to go! The Lib Dems are also fully subscribed to this groovy gender ideology. The likes of Layla Moran spout stuff about not caring about bodies, but seeing into people’s souls. This is the equivalent of those well-meaning liberals who “don’t see colour” and  is frankly, insulting. Many Lib Dem women are unhappy, and the news that one of  their big donors is a company that makes puberty blockers (Ferring Pharmaceuticals ) is more than uncomfortable. The Greens, who don’t like GM crops, suddenly seem to be embracing the case for puberty-blocking hormones and are so fully gender fluid that women exist simply now as “non-men”. The Greens have also embraced Aimee Knight, née Challenor, who is trans, as a Green Candidate for Coventry City Council. When she stood in the 2018 deputy leadership contest, her agent was her father, David who was sentenced to prison for 22 years for the rape and torture of a 10-year-old-girl in the family home. Aimee then joined the Lib Dems but was suspended in 2019 after tweets appeared on her partner’s account about fantasising about sex with children. She has since said the account appeared to have been hacked and the comments were not posted by her fiancé. The key point is, that in order to embrace fashionable diversity, key checks seem to have been overlooked. In Scotland, women have been thrown under every available bus. The women who accused Salmond of inappropriate behaviour at the recent inquiry are now simply irrelevant. Its new Hate Crime Bill does little to actually make the lives of trans people better, but is an attempt to appear more progressive than England .  Bit by bit, women’s sex-based rights are being eroded. Parties formed to protect the environment or to achieve independence have fallen over themselves to get in with the trans rights movement . So there is now a huge number of floating voters who are not anti-trans, but simply want to keep our sex- based rights and protections. Many of us are not Tories. So which savvy political party might speak for us or even recognise that we exist? We are met only with fear, abuse and silence. Do our votes not matter?",5
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/26/special-report-sturgeon-clings-tarnished-crown-inquiries-lift/,politics,"“It’s very clear that Nicola Sturgeon is damaged goods and her days are numbered. She is by no means off the hook.” The sort of verdict you might expect from a flag-waving Unionist at the end of a tempestuous week for the Scottish National Party. Except that those words were spoken by a former deputy leader of the SNP itself, even before Alex Salmond’s The jubilation among the First Minister’s supporters after she survived two inquiries into her role in the Alex Salmond affair lasted all of three days before Mr Salmond pulled back the tarpaulin on his ultimate vengeance weapon, the Alba Party, which threatens to blow up the SNP’s chances of a Holyrood majority in the May 6 elections. If the SNP – currently a minority government – achieves an overall majority, the party’s plans to force a second independence referendum will be rapidly accelerated. There is a growing belief within the SNP, however, that the party will fall short of the mark, and that if “IndyRef2” does happen, it might not be with Ms Sturgeon at the helm. The SNP’s poll rating peaked at 58 per cent last autumn, and stayed above 50 per cent for the whole of last year, putting the party on course for a majority,   according to a recent Opinium poll, suggesting the controversy has taken its toll. The twin inquiries into the SNP’s handling of sexual misconduct allegations made against former leader Mr Salmond have exposed to public view the toxic civil war between the Sturgeonites and the Salmondites, like a manhole cover being lifted off a sewer. Mr Salmond now intends to go another round with Ms Sturgeon in a fresh court case that could reveal damaging details suppressed in the inquiries. Then, at 2pm on Friday, came that Mr Salmond is to lead a new party into the elections. Its aim, he claims, is to achieve a “supermajority” for independence in the Scottish parliament, but its effect is more likely to be splitting the vote between the SNP and Alba (the Scottish Gaelic name for Scotland). Mr Salmond said on Friday that Alba was “planting our saltire on a hill” and that “in the next few weeks we shall see how many will rally to our standard”. In truth, he is parking his tanks on Ms Sturgeon’s lawn, driving a wedge into the split that already exists in the SNP, and calling on its members, MPs and MSPs to defect to his side. If he is elected to Holyrood, it will be the start of an all-out war between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond for the leadership, and the future, of Scotland.   Jim Sillars, the former deputy leader of the SNP, said: “I was a long-term critic of Alex Salmond when he led the SNP, and he of me. I take back not a word, and I expect him to be the same. “But Brexit, the pandemic, the failures of the SNP, the embarrassing stark lack of quality in its ranks in Holyrood, means we are in a new situation when old grievances need to be set aside. I welcome his return to frontline politics.” He added: “People have seen a face of the Scottish government that is unacceptable. People are not stupid. They know the government has misbehaved and engaged in a gross misuse of power. “This government is politically corrupt and the tentacles of political corruption have spread to institutions in civic society.” One serving SNP MP admitted: “Nicola’s brand has been tarnished. I think this will have an impact at the polls because people have seen the in-fighting and the rage.” For those who have not followed the labyrinthine progress of the Salmond affair, the basic facts are these: in 2018, details were leaked to a Scottish newspaper of sexual misconduct allegations against Mr Salmond, dating to 2013 when he was first minister. Mr Salmond denied the claims, accused the Scottish government of an abuse of process in its handling of the claims, and won a 2019 court case against the government, which had to pay him more than £500,000 for legal expenses. Weeks after winning the court case, Mr Salmond was charged by police with sexually assaulting nine women while he was first minister. He was cleared of 12 charges at a trial last year, the jury finding the 13th charge “not proven”. Mr Salmond accused members of the Sturgeon administration of by encouraging women to make complaints against him, which the SNP has always denied. He claimed Ms Sturgeon had known about the allegations for longer than she had admitted, and had lied to the Scottish Parliament about when she found out, a resignation matter if true. An independent inquiry by Irish barrister James Hamilton  though a committee of MSPs found  At the heart of the problem with Scottish politics is what Mr Sillars terms a “cult of personality” that began with Mr Salmond and was continued by Ms Sturgeon when she took over as SNP leader following defeat for the independence campaign in 2014’s “once in a generation” referendum. The SNP has not had a leadership election since 2004, such has been the dominance of Salmond and his former protege, but as one long-standing SNP member complained: “Any political party should be much bigger than one figure, because people always turn out to have feet of clay.” A cult is the opposite of a democracy, and the charge sheet of undemocratic behaviour by the SNP is growing. The party’s opponents cite the role of the Crown Office, the equivalent of England’s Crown Prosecution Service, which was able to  – over the two inquiries. In most democracies, the principle of the separation of powers means that prosecutors and politicians operate independently, as with England’s director of public prosecutions. But in Scotland, the Crown Office is headed by the Lord Advocate, who is also a member of the Cabinet, meaning the person who ultimately decides who does and does not face prosecution is a politician loyal to Ms Sturgeon (currently James Wolffe). As the former Brexit secretary “that leaves him conflicted and compromised, with his department’s independence undermined”. When the two inquiries’ reports were published this week, large sections were redacted on the orders of the Crown Office; Mr Hamilton himself complained that the redactions meant his own report “presents an incomplete and even at times misleading version of what happened”. Evidence given by Mr Salmond was redacted to protect the identities of complainants, according to the Crown Office, but Mr Davis, and others, have claimed the redactions did not identify the women and were designed only to protect Ms Sturgeon. Meanwhile, the somewhat toothless committee of MSPs which carried out the parliamentary inquiry complained that key evidence it requested from the Scottish government arrived with widespread redactions, with some documents “almost completely blank” and others with “pages and pages of fully redacted text”. The committee complained: “We did not know the basis on which redactions were being made.” Mr Salmond, ominously for Ms Sturgeon, has a plan to get that evidence out in the open. On Wednesday, he announced his intention to sue the Scottish government’s Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom he blamed for “catastrophic failures in this matter”. He pointed out that the courts would have “all the proper powers of recovery of documents” which the parliamentary committee lacked, and friends of Mr Salmond have confirmed that he believes those documents will implicate Ms Sturgeon’s office in what he sees as a conspiracy against him. He has also made a complaint to Police Scotland about the leaking of a story about the complaints against him in 2018, which could further embarrass the SNP if it proves to have come from someone close to Ms Sturgeon. “This could go on for a long time and could yet bring Nicola down,” admitted a senior SNP source. Amid the fevered anticipation of the inquiry reports, another potential time-bomb for Ms Sturgeon went largely unnoticed last weekend. Three members of the SNP’s Finance and Audit Committee resigned, reportedly because they had been denied full access to the party’s books by SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, also known as the husband of Nicola Sturgeon. One of the departees, Cynthia Guthrie, was announced yesterday as an Alba Party candidate. The SNP has not reported or even confirmed the resignations, let alone the reasons for them, and party sources have told The Telegraph they are “having a hard time” getting to the bottom of the matter. Questions about management of the SNP’s finances are not new: the party raised £600,000 for a second referendum campaign which it claimed was “ringfenced”, but only had £97,000 in the bank in its most recent accounts, and members now report being asked for more donations for a referendum “fighting fund”. A spokesman for the SNP said three people had resigned from its finance and audit committee following concerns about leaks to the media, and denied Mr Murrell had failed to provide access to the accounts.  It said the £600,000 raised for a referendum “is allocated to our 2021 budget and will be spent in this financial year”. Despite the whiff of scandal that has hung over Auld Reekie for the past three years, relatively few public figures have dared to speak out against the SNP, such is   its power and electoral dominance have engendered north of the border. Jack Perry CBE, the former chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, the national innovation and investment agency, has witnessed it at first hand. “The SNP party machine is good at intimidation,” he said. “It’s implicit that if you oppose them or offend them, you won’t get much business in the future. I have been at business events where every single firm is anti-independence but when an SNP minister turns up not a single person challenges them because they are afraid to.” Glasgow-based Barrhead Travel from nationalists when it backed the No campaign in the independence referendum.  when it branded its teacakes “British” rather than Scottish south of the border. Other businesses have learnt to keep quiet for fear of a fight with the so-called “cybernats” who launch attacks via social media. Earlier this week, it emerged that former Manchester United football manager Sir Alex Ferguson, not normally regarded as a shrinking violet,  in the 2014 referendum because “the people putting their heads above the parapet were getting shot at”, according to Alistair Campbell’s latest diaries. Sir Alex feared “dog’s abuse” for standing up for the Union, in which he is a passionate believer. Scots rely far more heavily on their government for employment than the English: the public sector accounts for 21.8 per cent of jobs in Scotland, compared with 16.4 per cent in England, meaning “a lot of private companies are reliant on public sector contracts”, Mr Perry said. He added that quangos which were once headed by independent-minded patrons ready to challenge the government and improve policy were now all too often populated with unquestioning SNP supporters. Even the education of Scotland’s children is up for grabs when it comes to promoting the nationalist cause, critics say. In December, Education Scotland finally withdrew a timeline of Scottish history after Sir Tom Devine, the country’s leading historian, Among its false claims was that Sir Winston Churchill “dispatched English troops and tanks” to stamp out a major protest by striking workers in Glasgow in 1919 while locking up Scottish soldiers in barracks. Other errors included a suggestion that Flower of Scotland – written in the 1960s – dated as far back as the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Academics had raised the alarm almost two years before the timeline – “clearly designed in the cause of Scottish independence”, according to one history professor – was eventually removed. Nor is the supposedly politically neutral civil service immune from the SNP’s iron grip. A taxpayer-funded Scottish Government video released at new year described the Brexit trade deal as “a bad deal for Scotland” that would cause “greater risk to national security”, prompting accusations that the civil service was While the SNP is ruthless in targeting its opponents, it reserves its most sinister threats for those within its ranks.  Joanna Cherry, the SNP MP for Edinburgh South West, was  last month following a row over transgender law reform (Ms Cherry QC believes the SNP is going too far in simplifying the legal process for changing gender). She later revealed she had been subjected to “an 18-month campaign of abuse” culminating with “a threat of corrective rape from a party member”. Other SNP members had bombarded her with abuse, calling her a **** , while friends said she had been subjected to “bullying, lies and smears” from her colleagues. “It has become an anti-free speech party,” said one Sturgeon critic within the SNP. “Anyone who dares to depart from the party line and suggest new ideas is pretty much crushed.” Fraser Nelson, the editor of The Spectator and a proud Scot, has also faced apparent attempts to intimidate him after his magazine went to court to fight for the right to publish Alex Salmond’s evidence in full (opposed, inevitably, by the Crown Office). Trisha Marwick, the former presiding officer (Speaker) of the Scottish Parliament tweeted: “We see you Fraser,” with sinister overtones of “we know where you live”. Douglas Ross, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said: ""Sturgeon is clearly suffering from hubris. She is not out of the woods. Neither she nor any other person has been held to account for this litany of scandals. “Most people are rightly repulsed by this unedifying feud and her scorched earth approach has undermined public faith in Scotland's parliament.” As a senior member of the SNP told The Telegraph: “If I didn’t depend on the SNP for my employment, I would have cut up my membership card by now.” A recent survey found that only 8 per cent of Scots rank independence as one of the top three most important issues ahead of the May elections, with Covid recovery, jobs and healthcare their more pressing concerns. For Ms Sturgeon, independence is a useful megaphone to drown out any discussion of her failures, which are numerous. Under her watch educational attainment is down; drug-related deaths have more than doubled (to three and a half times the rate for England, and by far the worst in Europe); life expectancy has decreased in some areas, and even before Covid, Scotland was running a   than the rest of the UK. The SNP also has no answers to key questions around what an independent Scotland would look like –   whether it would have its own armed forces, how it would pay its way without its current subsidies from Westminster – with one SNP MP blaming “intellectual laziness” within the party for its failure to come up with a plan. Despite such failings, after 14 years in power, the SNP seems certain to be the largest party yet again on May 6, either with a majority (for which just four more seats out of 129 are needed) or as a minority government backed by the pro-independence Greens. It will leave the SNP defying political gravity by retaining power for at least 18 years by the time of the 2025 election, a record matched only by the Conservatives during the Thatcher and Major era. What then? Ironically, the issue of independence is likely to present a threat to Ms Sturgeon from within her party. She will face significant pressure from the radical wing of her party to call an indicative referendum straight away (which would not be legally binding without consent from Westminster), capitalising on Boris Johnson’s unpopularity in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon, however, is by nature more cautious, preferring to build support for independence until the polls suggest a virtually guaranteed win, which at the moment they do not. Were Ms Sturgeon to succumb to activists’ wishes for a quick referendum but fail to win it, she would lose not only the leadership, but very possibly her hopes of breaking up the Union for decades to come. Whether she even gets to make that choice could yet be in the hands of Mr Salmond.",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/31/do-eyes-deceive-statue-dominic-cummings/,politics,"In the list of Britain's top tourist attractions, it might struggle to rival the likes of Buckingham Palace or the Eden Project. But Dominic Cummings'   could soon be commemorated with a statue in the historic market town, The Telegraph has learned. Plans have been submitted to the local council for a life-sized bronze of  , who drove to the beauty spot last April in what he claimed was a bid to test his eyesight. Local tourist chiefs argue that the town should capitalise on the infamy Mr Cummings brought it, having seen   once lockdown was lifted last summer. Shopkeepers in the town say the question they are most commonly asked by visitors is ""where is the place that Dominic Cummings  ?"" and many would like to be able to point tourists to a plaque or statue marking the exact spot by the town's riverside. A planning application submitted by Olaf Priol, a member of the local historic society, requests permission for a 5ft 11in bronze on a pyrite plinth, depicting Mr Cummings wearing a trademark hoodie and jeans, carrying a set of car keys and ""squinting into the distance, adjusting his spectacles with his right hand"". The plans are likely to prove controversial as a local by-law states that statues in the town can only depict ""deceased historic figures"" who have ""contributed to the common good"". However, the council has the power to set aside the by-law if someone has made an ""exceptional contribution"" to the national and international profile of Barnard Castle. Supporters of the plan are likely to point out that Mr Cummings' visit led to Barnard Castle being name-checked in newspapers around the world. Last summer, the then mayor of the town, which is 30 miles from Mr Cummings' parents' home in Durham, said the huge   had ""done us good in the sense that it has put us on the map"". Beer firm BrewDog even made a special IPA called Barnard Castle Eye Test, which sold more than 800,000 cans. Barnard Castle received another boost this week when Boris Johnson announced a new facility to ""fill and finish"" Covid-19 vaccines will be opened in the town. He later joked to MPs that Mr Cummings had been ""scouting out the complex"" during his Easter Saturday visit last year.",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/04/01/covid-lockdown-roadmap-dates-rules-lift-easing-restrictions-extension/,politics," - as part of the roadmap out of lockdown, the stay-at-home rule ended and the rule of six returned in England. These measures are part of the four key steps over four months to bring the UK completely out of lockdown. The plans are an attempt to kick-start the British economy and ease the societal pressures of lockdown without triggering a dangerous resurgence of the virus. The roadmap is underpinned by four key “tests” that are linked to data, which will act like a checklist that must be met before moving onto the next step of reopening. The four tests will determine whether:   is going as planned; vaccines are effective in bringing down deaths and hospitalisations;  are not rising so fast that the NHS risks being overwhelmed;   do not create unforeseen risks. Another big change is the scrapping of tiers, to be replaced with ""steps"".  Step one, part one applied to all of England from March 8, with the second part from  . Regions will enter step two no earlier than Apr 12, and step three no earlier than May 17.   Step four, which will come into force no earlier than Jun 21, should see ""all legal limits on social contact"" lifted.  The Prime Minister said it was thanks to the UK public ""that we can continue on our road map to freedom"". He said: ""We will meet our targets, offering a first dose to everyone over 50 by the middle of next month, as well as those under 50 who are clinically vulnerable, and offering a first dose of a vaccine to every adult by the end of July. It comes as  and deaths from the virus are at the lowest level since October, official figures reveal. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) findings, which on Mar 30  , suggest there is widespread immunity either due to previous infection or  . While on Mar 31 the Government insisted it is ""100 per cent confident"" in the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, after  . As of Mar 31, a total of 30,905,538 people have received one dose of the vaccine, with over 4m having received both jabs. Completing inoculation of the nearly 30m Britons between doses is the government's current priority moving forward. The third test has triggered early debate, because rising cases alone will not be enough to stop reopening. That will happen only if rising cases risk overwhelming hospitals. The four steps are separated five weeks apart. That leaves four weeks to monitor the impact of the preceding step and one week to give people notice. The reopening is designed to happen uniformly across England, so there is no return to the tier system. Below are the four steps of the roadmap. The dates are the earliest dates at which the next step could happen, with delays possible if the data takes a negative turn.  The first step, which began on Mar 8, is split into two sections, initially focusing on getting   again and reuniting families who have spent so long kept apart. All schools in England, both primary and secondary, have now reopened, with   in schools and at home.  Pupils are expected to wear face masks in the opening weeks. However, students will not be forced to wear face coverings in classrooms, as some will be ""anxious and nervous"" about wearing them, children's minister Vicky Ford has said.  School sports have also returned, both indoor and outdoor, so pupils of all ages can get back to playing football and doing PE lessons. Schools can set their own rules. ‘Wraparound’ childcare is allowed to resume, which means after school sports and extra curricular clubs can take place.  There were also  on Mar 8. Residents are now allowed to have a single visitor, and that individual can visit repeated times rather than the trip being a one-off. The visitor and care home resident will be allowed to hold hands, but other close contact is not allowed. The visitor must get a Covid-19 test beforehand and wear protective equipment. The outdoor socialising rules have changed in the second section of reopening. From March 29, six people from six different households were allowed to meet outside, meaning the so-called ‘rule of six’ returned. Alternatively, two households could also meet outside. This means two families, who potentially together total more than six people, are allowed to meet. This can happen in both outdoor public spaces and in back gardens.  has been dropped, similarly the Government has dropped its “stay local” messaging, meaning that households are no longer explicitly told to remain in their geographical area.  While people will still be encouraged to minimise travel, there will not be punishments for someone who drives a few hours for a meet-up outside, then returns that day.  Outdoor organised sports for both adults and children will also return. Outdoor swimming pools, driving and shooting ranges, riding arenas at riding centres, archery venues and climbing walls are also allowed to open. So too outdoor gyms. The return of team sports can only happen in formalised settings, meaning that five-a-side football matches are allowed but a dozen friends kicking a ball in a park is not. Indoor sports will still be off limits. Also the sports must be organised, so a large group of people cannot gather to kick around a football if it breaks the number limits explained above.  will be allowed to open from Apr 12, if the data allows. People may be urged to only go in alone rather than as an entire household. Retailers will be as the Government seeks to bolster the high street and ensure compliance with social distancing rules.  However, a tourism industry leader said it was ""extraordinary"" that visitor attractions would be forced to remain closed when non-essential retail opened. Bernard Donoghue, director of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva), made the comment as he revealed major UK tourist sites suffered a 70% decline in visitor numbers last year compared with 2019. Mr Donoghue said: ""It's extraordinary to me that you can open Primark and H&M but not the Tate and V&A (Victoria and Albert Museum). Not least because, according to Public Health England, there hasn't been a single case of coronavirus transmission at a visitor attraction in the UK. They've proved to be Covid safe.""  can open again from the same date, but only outside, so pub gardens and outdoor dining will be back. Groups can gather, but with the same limits as above: either up to six people or two households.  There will be no curfews or any requirement to serve a meal with alcohol, removing the  Pubs will be allowed to serve takeaway pints.  Boris Johnson indicated on Mar 24 that   when they reopen later this year. However, Mr Johnson said it may not be feasible to implement the plans until everyone has been offered a vaccine, after publicans criticised his plans. The Prime Minister said on Mar 25 that the Government will say more on their possible use in early April, and suggested they could also be based on whether  , as well as vaccinations and negative tests. Staycations will be allowed, in a limited form. One household will be allowed to stay overnight somewhere in the UK, but not with another household. ‘Self-contained accommodation’ will be available to rent, so for example cottages or Airbnb rentals or campsites. However hotels and B&Bs cannot reopen. Hairdressers and nail salons will be allowed to open.  Outdoor hospitality venues like zoos and theme parks can also open. The limit on the maximum number of attendees at weddings and wakes will also rise from six to 15. There will be no change for funerals, to which 30 attendees are already allowed. Gyms can also open but you cannot attend with people outside of your household, because indoor socialising is barred at this point. Gym classes are not yet allowed. From May 17, groups of up to six people and two households will be allowed to meet indoors, so people can enter each other's homes from now.  The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, stated on Feb 23 that  , although people must remain ""cautious"" until this date.  Pubs and restaurants can open indoors. It is unlikely there will be strict requirements on capacity, but it must be table service. Hotels and B&Bs can open in step three,as can indoor sports and gym classes. Entertainment venues can open too, including cinemas and theatres. New rules will be in place for different sizes of venues. Normal outdoor events can open for up to 4,000 people or 50 per cent of the venue capacity, whichever is smaller.  Similarly normal indoor events can open for up to 1,000 people or 50 per cent capacity, again whichever is lower. For huge outdoor seated venues there is a special limit. Up to 10,000 attendees will be allowed or 25 per cent capacity, whichever is lower.  This means, for example, Wembley Stadium will be able to open with 10,000 fans attending. Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, said that coronavirus ""certificates"", were being considered as a way of getting people back to larger events ""in significant numbers"" from Jun 21. ""We're piloting the different things that will enable that to happen - clearly it will have to be done in a Covid-secure way"", he said. ""You would expect, and we will be testing these things, things like one-way systems, things like masks, things like hand hygiene and everything else. ""Another thing that we are considering is a Covid certification, and we will be testing whether we can use Covid certification to help facilitate the return of sports."" Weddings, receptions, wakes, funerals, and other life events like Bar mitzvahs and christenings will be allowed to be attended by up to 30 people. This will be as close to normal as possible. There will be no attendance limits on weddings and funerals. Big venues that were unable to open last year, such as nightclubs, can finally reopen. Many of the details for what can happen now is dependent on a number of reviews. There are four reviews that have been commissioned that sit below the roadmap. They are designed to find answers that right now the Government feels it cannot give. Each has a ‘complete by now’ date, meaning we know when to expect clarity but not what the review will decide or if it will lead to a change in the rules. One review is looking at international travel. It will see whether with vaccine certificates and testing the border can be more open than it is now. This must conclude before step three on May 17 but could report back in April. That means - theoretically at least - the borders could be relaxed in time for summer holidays. However there is no guarantee the current rules, which bar anyone from travelling overseas for holiday, will be lifted after the review, meaning summer holidays abroad are not guaranteed. It comes as Boris Johnson confirmed that the UK’s holiday roadmap will be unveiled on April 5. The Government’s Global Travel Taskforce was expected to report on April 12, but at a Government press conference on Mar 28 Mr Johnson confirmed the announcement will be made one week earlier than planned , with further detail to be given on April 12. But many experts have warned that Covid variants  . New regulations that passed with the review of coronavirus restrictions on Mar 25 include a provision to ban leaving the United Kingdom ""without a reasonable excuse"", meaning those leaving the UK without a valid reason could face a £5,000 fine. Exemptions include work, volunteering, studying, elite sports, legal obligations, medical reasons, care and assistance to vulnerable person, wedding of a close family member - but   going on holiday. Matt Hancock confirmed in an interview with   on Mar 23 that this policy will come into force in the week of Mar 28. A second review will look at social distancing measures. These include the keeping of two metres apart outside (or ‘one metre-plus’ inside), wearing face masks and being encouraged to work from home. That review is due to report back before stage four, which is Jun 17. In other words, do not expect to be told to go back to work in an office until the summer at the earliest. A third review will look at Covid vaccine certificates being used domestically. This is interesting as Government ministers had previously played down that possibility.  understands that   could be introduced at theatres, football matches, business conferences, wedding venues and  . The Prime Minister has confirmed that Michael Gove has tasked in  , in which the ""deep and complex issues"" surrounding the introduction of immunity certificates will be examined. Boris Johnson skirted the issue on Mar 24, stating that the use of vaccine passports in pubs may be up to the discretion of individual landlords. It is understood that the Government remains concerned about the implications of such steps and will weigh moral and ethical implications of any moves like this. It will report back by step four, which is Jun 17. The fourth review will look at large events. It will attempt to work out when it is safe for large events to be held again. It too will report back by step four, so Jun 17. Pilots for big outdoor events will be allowed to take place from April.",0

When she won the   I made the point that we should no longer make the distinction between male and female jockeys – as she herself wishes - and I absolutely stick by that. But I am still wondering whether Blackmore is just very good or the distillation of four decades of females trying to break through? The answer is probably a bit of both. Forget females as professional jockeys for a moment, it should be remembered that until the end of WWII, all stable staff were men and it was not until the 105th running of the Grand National, in 1951, that the winner of that race was led up by a girl for the first time. So, in the time that it takes to grow a reasonably sized oak tree from an acorn, the sport has gone from all male to where we are now; a majority of stable staff are female and  . When I was riding, from the start of the 1980s, it was at roughly the same time as the early pioneers; Lorna Vincent, Diane Clay, Tarnya Sherwood, Susan Kersey, Ryan Moore’s aunt Candy Morris, Penny Ffitch-Heyes and my younger sister Gee who had had a double at the Cheltenham Festival in 1987 before I had virtually had a ride at it. (Annoyingly – younger sisters are not meant to do that). But those early pioneers crashed a few planes trying to prove themselves on bad horses. Jayne Thompson died six days after a first fence fall at Catterick in November 1986 without ever coming round. Jessica Charles-Jones was paralysed from the waist down, aged 23, at Southwell while Sharon Murgatroyd was paralysed from the chest down when her mount fell at the last hurdle at Bangor, trying to get the horse round so that she might keep the ride on it next time, in 1991. Those two spent the rest of their truncated lives in wheelchairs. Jessica died in 2010 and Sharon in 2014 – both before their time. From a very close-knit, small pool of female riders that was a high strike rate of catastrophic injuries and, I guess, when they come to write the definitive history of female jump jockeys it will say that as a breed they took 10 years to recover and it was not until Nina Carberry and Katie Walsh started coming over in the 2000s and winning at Cheltenham that they started to really get going again. “I’m embarrassed to be described as a pioneer for Rachael Blackmore,” says my sister, Gee Bradburne who hides the videos of her racing from her children because, she reckons, she looks so awful. “She’s in a different league. We just held on to the mane and kicked like hell. She’s reaching the sky, I was ambitious but one of my ambitions in those days was to get a working shower in the girls’ changing rooms at every racecourse across the country! “I remember at Worcester our changing room was a corridor, with no windows, beside the owners and trainers bar. When Princess Anne came to ride they put in a carpet and catering but it was slightly disappointing when we went back the next time that both were gone. But, in a way, you can’t blame the racecourses – there were never more than two or three of us and there wasn’t the demand. “But I always thought if there was a girl who was good enough being a woman wouldn’t stop them – even in those days. It was always injuries or mistakes that stopped us, just as it stops a lot of the lads who don’t make it. At that stage there wasn’t a girl who rode well enough. A few hit the scene for a short time but none of us stood the test of time.” If anyone was looking down and smiling on Blackmore last week it would have been Jayne Thompson, Jessica Charles-Jones and Sharon Murgatroyd, the women who paid a big price for their pioneering spirit. ",1

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/racing/0/grand-national-2021-when-aintree-races-start-date-time-tv/,sport,"The Grand National is back   It is the best known steeplechase in the world in which 40 runners tackle the daunting obstacles of Aintree's 30 Grand National fences over the course of four and a half miles. The National is the highlight of Aintree's Grand National meeting which this year runs from Thursday April 8 to Saturday April 10. The main event will be on Saturday as things stand.  However, as our racing correspondent Marcus Armytage reports, that date could be put back in the light of the Government announcing its four-stage plan to move out of lockdown: The runners will go to post for 5.15pm.  Aintree Racecourse, which has hosted the race since 1839. The racecourse is situated approximately six miles outside of Liverpool.  Live coverage will once again be on ITV1. Alternatively, you can bookmark this page and return on race day to follow all the action on our dedicated live blog.  The race was cancelled due to March's announcement of a national lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic. In its place was an animated virtual Grand National shown on ITV, won by 18-1 shot Potters Corner. Punters will be pleased that the living, breathing animals are back this time.  The final field of 40 runners is yet to be selected and won't be confirmed until the week of the race.  For now, click on the underlined words that follow to read the   as it stands. All of the horses will be assigned a weight by the British Horse Racing Authority Head of Handicapping in February. The handicap system is simpler than it sounds, and is designed to create as close a race as possible. The better horses carry the most weight while the outsiders carry the least. Each horse has an OR (official rating) and this will largely determine the weight they carry. , after he was rated just one pound off the top weight held by Bristol de Mai, Santini and Easyland. His Gigginstown owners described that eight as 'unfair'. The Aintree fences are not quite as perilous as they were once upon a time after a series of alterations. However, they are still the most notorious obstacles in the business and enough to make the palms of any jockey sweat.   The sixth and 22nd fence in the race may not be the biggest, but it's difficulty comes from the fact the landing side is 10 inches lower than the take off side. Named after Captain Martin Becher, a jockey who fell at this stage and hid in the brook to avoid injury.   Named after a horse that allegedly jumped it backwards in 1840. More likely, the horse spun around in mid-air to create the optical illusion that its hind legs landed first.  The tallest fence on the course now stands a five foot three inches.   One of the smaller fences is named after the 100/1 shot who avoided a disastrous pile-up here in 1967 and went on to win.  As the name suggests, horses must take a sharp turn to the left after jumping this five foot obstacle. Another Aintree myth is that horses used who refused to turn ended up in the Liverpool and Leeds canal. ",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2021/03/27/wada-launches-investigation-gb-riders-2010-drug-test/,sport,"British Cycling and UK Anti-Doping say they are trying to assist the World Anti-Doping Agency’s enquiries after an investigation was launched over the weekend into allegations Ukad allowed British Cycling to carry out its own internal probe into a rider's sample, which allegedly contained traces of a banned anabolic steroid.  Ukad is said to have informed British Cycling of the sample, which dates from the autumn of 2010 and allegedly contained traces of a metabolite of nandrolone, with British Cycling then conducting its own internal follow-up, using a private laboratory, HFL Sport Science in Cambridgeshire, to run tests on four riders. Lots of teams and governing bodies run internal screening programmes. It is allowed as long as there is full transparency with Ukad and results are shared and it is done to Wada standards. Any positive test and Ukad takes over.  According to the Mail on Sunday, the Cambridge lab said in an email to British Cycling that it had received permission from Ukad’s then head of legal Graham Arthur to run the tests. However, Ukad have so far found no record of a conversation between Arthur and the head of the lab. And it is still unclear whether Ukad ever saw the results of the tests which were carried out. There is also concern over an alleged email from British Cycling’s then   to the riders who took part in the testing asking whether they would be happy to cooperate, with the lab “reporting only to myself and [then head of medicine] Dr Steve Peters and NOT Wada or UK Anti-doping…”. A Wada spokesperson described the findings as a “significant concern” adding that it had asked its independent Intelligence and Investigations Department to look into the matter. Ukad is understood to be confident it acted within Wada guidelines and strongly objects to the suggestion that it “tipped off” British Cycling over the initial test. On the contrary, it was not unusual to inform a governing body of a sample showing trace findings as they are below the threshold required to investigate and could indicate a health issue concerning the athlete in question or some other innocent explanation, for instance a contaminated supplement. Ukad can, of course, use the trace sample to target-test the athlete in question over the next period. British Cycling said the departure of key personnel in the intervening period made an investigation challenging. ""We are unable to give full comment on this story at this stage as the events took place over 10 years ago and none of the senior management team involved have worked for British Cycling for some time,"" it said in a statement. ""We are reviewing such archived records that exist from this period and, although that is not a straightforward or quick process, we will share the findings with the relevant parties."" Ukad, for whom current chief executive Nicole Sapstead was then Director of Operations, is attempting to find evidence of the authorisation Arthur allegedly gave to the Cambridge lab, as well as evidence that it followed up on the tests themselves, all of which returned negative. ""We are working with the World Anti-Doping Agency to investigate claims relating to private testing carried out by British Cycling in 2011,"" said a spokesman. ""Ukad is examining archives to confirm decisions that were taken in 2011 followed due process set by Wada.""",0

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/25/jean-claude-juncker-attacks-ursula-von-der-leyen-stupid-vaccines/,politics,"Jean-Claude Juncker has attacked Ursula von der Leyen, his successor as European Commission president, for starting  Mr Juncker said he was “not a fan” of Mrs von der Leyen’s threat of imposing an export ban on EU manufactured jabs to the UK and warned it would “create major reputational damage” for the bloc. “We used to be the world's free trade champion,"" he said as EU leaders meet for a summit to discuss the potential ban, ""We have to pull back from a vaccine war.” Mr Juncker also criticised the EU for being too slow in approving and buying vaccines, branding the bloc as “too cautious” and “budget conscious” in an interview with BBC’s HardTalk. The veteran politician led the commission from 2014 to 2019, which included the period after the Brexit referendum.  ""We have special relations with Britain, there's room for dialogue [...] nobody in Britain, nobody in Europe understands why we are witnessing such a stupid vaccine war,” Mr Juncker said.  “What the EU is asking for cannot be dealt with in a war atmosphere. We are not in war and we are not enemies - we are allies."" The former prime minister of Luxembourg added: ""I don't understand this [EU] temptation to fight against Britain, and the British temptation to fight against the EU. Let's discuss it amongst adult people. What is the image we're giving?'"" The EU summit, forced online because of the third wave of coronavirus sweeping Europe, is being held as new trade rules come into force which allow Brussels to target countries, like Britain, with higher vaccination rates than the EU.  The commission has already threatened to block the export of millions of AstraZeneca vaccines from the company's Halix plant in Leiden, the Netherlands. It wants the UK to forego its first refusal on supplies from AstraZeneca’s two British plants so they can supply the bloc. Divided EU leaders are expected to withhold explicit backing for a ban amid fears it could spark a vaccines trade war. But the pressure on Britain is expected to build because France, Germany and Italy all support Mrs von der Leyen’s plan to threaten bans targeted at AstraZeneca. ",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2021/03/25/screaming-rows-threats-sue-humdrum-tennis-match-turned-ugly/,sport,"The growing tension between the ATP Tour and a group of dissatisfied players came to a head on Wednesday night as Vasek Pospisil — the leader of the dissenting group — exited the Miami Open amid an expletive-filled rant at chair umpire Arnaud Gabas. Unusually for an angry player, Pospisil was not complaining about a line-call — but rather about the ATP president Andrea Gaudenzi. “An hour and a half yesterday, the chair of the ATP f---ing screaming at me in a player meeting for trying to unite the players,” said Pospisil, after losing the first set against the USA’s McKenzie McDonald. “For an hour and a half. The leader of the ATP. Get him out here. F------ a------.” Gabas replied: “That’s enough. If you need to say something to him, then outside this court.” To which Pospisil said, “Why am I here? If you wanna default me I’ll gladly sue this whole organisation.” The outburst came after several days of meetings had failed to produce a united platform from which the players could challenge the ATP leadership. There have been gripes aplenty — about everything from prize money in Miami, which is down by 60 per cent, to the frozen rankings system and the protocols within the tournaments’ various bio-bubbles. As ever in tennis, though, it is one thing to identify the problems and another to fix them. This sport is a nest of interlocking systems — which might be a good thing if those systems worked together seamlessly. Unfortunately, as the former ATP chairman Etienne de Villiers said this week, “Everyone distrusts everyone else. To use a very eloquent Wordsworthian expression, it’s a ratf---.”  understands Gaudenzi made this very point to Pospisil when the two men met at a players’ meeting on the basketball court in Miami on Tuesday night, with an audience that also included ATP chief executive Massimo Calvelli. Gaudenzi and Calvelli had been at dinner when they were called in to see Pospisil by a couple of players. According to sources, the meeting can be summed up as Pospisil listing his grievances, and then Gaudenzi challenging him to give the solutions and asking if he really thought that tennis’s deep-seated issues — which were spelled out this week in a Bloomberg report — could be so easily solved. (The Bloomberg report suggested that the key problem lies in tennis “accounting for only 1.3 per cent of the total value of global sports TV and media rights, a smaller share than golf, hockey, or cricket”.) Who came off better or worse from the basketball-court meeting will be a matter of opinion. Almost everyone in tennis agrees the ATP leadership have been all but invisible during the Covid crisis. On the other hand, Pospisil seems to have been struggling to create a convincing alternative to the ATP’s admittedly distant way of doing things, and his explosion on the court can hardly be described as statesmanlike. As for the meeting itself, the Open Court website reported: “Gaudenzi and company really went after him [Pospisil]. They called him things like ‘ignorant’, ‘uneducated’ – lovely stuff like that.” Open Court reporter Stephanie Myles added that Pospisil was reportedly in tears afterwards and was still “shaken up” when he went on court. Pospisil posted an apology after the match on social media. “I want to sincerely apologise for my behaviour on the court in Miami earlier today,” he said. “I disrespected the game I love and for that I am truly sorry. By way of explanation, I felt deeply unnerved during a meeting between players and ATP executives last night, and I underestimated the toll those emotions took on me until I stepped onto the court today.”  to start a rival players’ organisation last year, the PTPA, which prompted Gaudenzi to warn: “it wouldn’t work and everyone would lose”. The PTPA remains low profile, but Djokovic and Pospisil left the ATP player council in August — along with leading American players John Isner and Sam Querrey — in order to set up the new body. During his pre-tournament press conference in Miami on Wednesday, Isner was asked if the players were disappointed with the reduced prize money. “It's not so much about the prize money,” he replied. “We don't really want to make it about that. Maybe it's about tour structure that the players would like to have a little bit more, I guess, better knowledge of as to why decisions are made, what went into making each decision.”",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/boxing/0/saul-canelo-alvarez-vs-billy-joe-saunders-fight-when-where/,sport,"Billy Joe Saunders, the unbeaten British fighter, is to face Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in a super middleweight unification megafight. The bout is scheduled for May 8, the Cinco de Mayo weekend, at a venue yet to be announced. Miami, Dallas or Las Vegas are the three most likely locations. The four titles on the line are from the WBC, WBA Super, WBO and Ring Magazine. A win for Alvarez would leave him with IBF champion Caleb Plant to beat in order to hold every world championship at super middleweight. A win for Saunders would be one of the greatest British victories of all time. Alvarez destroyed the WBC's mandatory challenger, Avni Yildirim, in three rounds on Saturday 27 February, at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami in front of 12,000 fans. Often referred to as the bad boy of British boxing, the Hertfordshire fighter comes from the traveller race and is undefeated as a two-weight world champion in a 30-fight career. He has been fined on several occasions by the British Boxing Board of Control for ill-discipline, and, just hours after the Alvarez fight was confirmed, appeared on Instagram wearing an apron with a fake penis, in a video from his training camp in Spain. “Canelo, I’m ready to rock and roll,” Saunders said. “You have to dare to be great and you aren’t going to be a great if you don’t beat the greats. I believe I am the only one with the footwork, knowhow, skillset, mindset and brain to unlock that door in Canelo. ""He’s the main man in the sport and the face of boxing. You have to give him respect, he hasn’t ducked anyone, he’s beaten good names, but nobody is unbeatable, and I believe I have got the tools to beat him if I use them properly. “I am looking at the golden ticket to cement my legacy, and that’s how you have to go in there to beat him. I’ve won everything from Southern Area to world titles. I could say ‘I’ve won it all, been to the Olympics, I’m unbeaten — I’ll see you later’. But I’ve only just turned 31, I’ve got no miles on the clock, haven’t taken any punishment — I believe he’s been in harder fights than me and has more miles, so I want to cement my legacy and beat him.” The Mexican is ranked the No 1 pound-for-pound boxer in the world. He is a world champion in four weight divisions from light-middleweight to light heavyweight. Saunders will be the  seventh British fighter to take him on; Alvarez’s victory over Turkey's Yildirim followed his triumph over Liverpool's Callum Smith in December. The youngest of seven brothers who have all fought professionally, Alvarez has gone 57 fights with just one defeat — to Floyd Mayweather Jr in 2013. He has acknowledged that in Saunders, he will face an accomplished and awkward southpaw. ""He’s a very difficult fighter. We need to go for him,"" he said. ""People talk, but I’m a mature fighter. I know how to control myself.  All I need to do is go into the ring, win and make history. “I want to unify the division. No one has done it in Latin America. In the world only a few fighters have done it — the best. I want to make history and be one of the best in the world.”",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2021/03/26/dinara-safina-interview-felt-stupid-saying-world-no1-couldnt/,sport,"Dinara Safina stood in front of her bathroom mirror, looked herself in the eye, and said, “I am No  1. I am the best.” It sounds like a scene from a mushy motivational movie – Dead Poets Society, perhaps, or A League of Their Own. But Safina experienced no surge of inspiration. No matter how she delivered the words, they just didn’t feel right. “Maybe for somebody it works,” she says during a Zoom call from her home in Monaco. “Maybe it helps self-motivation or self-confidence. But you have to be the kind of person who believes this. If you don’t believe, saying that makes no sense. You can repeat a thousand, million times. But you look at yourself and say, ‘I am stupid, saying this to myself.’ ” The scene dates from Safina’s defining season of 2009 – a bewildering, discombobulating, emotional switchback ride which would have sent anyone to the psychologist’s couch. That was the year she reached successive major finals in Melbourne and Paris, winning 53 of her first 64 matches. The trend pointed ever upwards, and yet the graph never spiked in a defining peak: the conquest of that elusive grand-slam trophy. In those two major finals, Safina collected a combined tally of nine games against Serena Williams and Svetlana Kuznetsova. She ran full tilt into a mental block. “Sometimes I couldn’t handle the pressure,” admitted Safina, who is still only 34. “That’s me personally. Still in the normal life I am very hard on myself. Everything has to be perfect – like this, like this, like this. “And sometimes, when the result was not what I expected, or what I would wish, I would get so disappointed.” Safina hails from a uniquely distinguished Russian tennis family. Her mother, Rauza Islanova, used to coach at the Spartak Moscow club with her babies suspended in a sling. Her father, Mikhail Safin, was the director of that club. And her brother, Marat, was the buccaneering, vodka-loving hellraiser who won the 2000 US Open as well as the 2005 Australian Open, which would prove to be the last slam for almost five years to escape the “Big Three” men. Marat and Dinara still stand unique as the only brother/sister duo to both reach No 1 in the world. Yet they are remembered very differently: him as the cool, sunglasses-wearing type known for inviting women to watch him from his player box, her as the nearly woman who never cemented her position at the top of the game. Did she ever ask him for advice on how to handle her anxieties? “It’s tough to speak with Marat, because I think male and female are very different,” Safina replied. “Whenever he has a stress situation for him it is a challenge – ‘What can I do out of this situation?’ For them [male players] it’s fun. For a female it is more like ‘Oh my God, if I play bad, I will be so embarrassed.’ You start to doubt in yourself.” If Safina never managed to overcome her big-match nerves, that is partly because her body did not give her the chance. A stress fracture in her lower back cut her career brutally short at the age of 25, and left her bracketed alongside Jelena Jankovic as a late-Noughties world No 1 who never won a major. (Caroline Wozniacki, the final member of this maligned trio, would eventually escape the “slam-less No 1” slur by winning the 2018 Australian Open.) What next for Safina, who officially retired in 2014? Having lacked expert guidance in her own career, she now wants to steer younger players away from the same pitfalls. Before the pandemic started, she had been planning a new coaching initiative in Valencia. “I would have loved to have had a mentor,” said Safina. “Psychologists say basic things, but they have never been in the situation – not even as visitors to the match. “For me, maybe it would have been more interesting to speak to some other tennis player. “After the [2009] French Open final, I had that scarring in my heart. I was maybe one week being depressed – ‘How can I lose this final?’– instead of thinking, ‘OK, what is next coming up, and what can I do better?’  ""I would love at that moment to have had a mentor who shakes me a little and says,  ‘Wait, it’s just the French Open final, you still have Wimbledon, you still have the US Open, so stop focusing on this.’”   True to her Moscovian roots, Safina is hard-headed about the disciplines that foster success. During our conversation, she spoke about her 5.30am starts at the Australian Open, fretted about the distracting influence of electronic gadgets and denounced Instagram as a “fake world where nobody knows what is true”. Some youngsters might retreat from her directness; others would surely thrive on it. Either way, she is well qualified to join Conchita Martinez and Amelie Mauresmo as elite performers now turned to coaching. “Conchita is doing great,” said Safina of Martinez, the former Wimbledon champion who has worked with Karolina Pliskova and Garbine Muguruza. “I just wonder why other players don’t ask, ‘Can I work with you?’ or, ‘Can I have you at least as part-time coach?’ “I think there are so many players would really love to share their experience and they can be really helpful. We know tennis from a different way, we have been there, we have played. “It would be more interesting to have more female coaches. When you are on the tour as a player, you have the team, the coach, the agent, who talk to you and you never lift up your head and say, ‘Wait – can I just look around?’ Instead open your eyes a little bit, step back. Say ‘The agent is not going to tell who is for me, I’m going to say who I want.’ Because you can always find the number of the person you want and talk to him or her. It’s not that we live on another planet.”  ",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/0/can-play-golf-covid-lockdown-rules-england/,sport," that can be practised in a socially-distanced way have been making strong representations to the Government throughout these national lockdowns. And now golf's gates have finally reopened, here is all you need to know... England’s fairways reopened at first light on Monday, March 29 with clubs primed for full starting sheets and minimal disruption due to Covid-19 restrictions.  Among the first to re-open its doors was the Morley Hayes Golf Club, near Derby, with players teeing off at 12.01am on Monday for a seven-hole floodlit charity tournament. The unseasonably warm weather surely led to a bumper week for the sport in the country as golfers at last had the chance to emulate their counterparts in Scotland and Wales, who have been merrily teeing it up at different degrees. England Golf, the governing body, made clear its anger at the decision to bracket golf together with other outdoor pursuits, adamant it proved itself as “the official socially-distant pursuit” last summer. But now the pins are back in the holes, there is an urgency to build on the spectacular growth of 2020, which saw participation levels soar and memberships bulge.  Tim Barnes, who co-owns and runs two courses in Cheshire, highlighted the demand. ""I’ve just had a text from one member asking that if he shines his car headlights down the first at 12.01am, he could hit a shot,"" he said on Sunday morning. ""We are pretty much booked up for the whole week at both Hartford Golf Club and Pryor Hayes. With the sun promised and the clocks brought forward, we are anticipating an exhilaratingly busy week."" The industry has been buoyed by the allowance of fourballs from the off, a scenario not yet permitted in Wales which is limited to two-balls. Of course, this means more players able to re-indulge immediately with their passion; albeit sanitised. However, golfers are now accustomed to the coronavirus rules and observing the necessary caution, including not using bunker rakes, cleaning the pin, not shaking hands etc  England Golf has published its ‘Play Safe, Stay Safe’ protocols, which it says ""should be referenced by all golfers and golf clubs"". Clubhouses will remain shut for the next few weeks - until drinks are allowed to be served outside - but the thirst to play is the priority and is about to be blessedly sated.  Some clubs have decided to reopen with a charity event. Ferndown Golf Club in Dorset has chosen to mark the reopening of its course from March 29 with a charity fundraiser for Marie Curie. The idea behind the initiative is simple, if unusual – the worse you play, the more money you raise. Each golfer pays a £3 entry fee, marks a card according to their handicap and for every shot they finish above par, they donate an additional £1 to Marie Curie funds. Harry Redknapp is one of the entrants.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/18/year-coronavirus-lockdown-boris-johnsons-hospitalisation-sparked/,politics,"Ever since his   last year, debate has raged about the extent to which the experience changed Boris Johnson's approach to tackling the pandemic. His most loyal aides have always insisted it did not change him at all – but some allies now privately concede that he emerged from his hospital stay a different man. ""That whole near-death experience made him look at this through a different lens,"" said one. ""After he came out of hospital... he started talking about how we could lose more people to Covid than we lost in the Second World War."" Irrespective of the effect his illness had on him, Mr Johnson's   was almost certainly the closest Britain has come to losing a Prime Minister in office since Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Now, for the first time, some of those who were closest to the centre of power while Mr Johnson's life hung in the balance have spoken about both the moment they feared they might lose him and the Cabinet in-fighting his absence prompted. The Prime Minister was taken into hospital  . While he fought for his life, another battle was going on at the heart of Government. ""It became a bit of a power struggle between different ministers,” said one well-placed source. ""We were trying to keep team spirit together, but Michael [Gove] and Dom Raab were taking chunks out of each other. It was just awful. ""There was a lot of talk of how Dom was trying to consolidate power, Michael was trying to muscle in on various committees and there was just lots of this noise going on. ""The PM was the final decision-maker, meaning that while he was in hospital it all went to Raab – but Gove didn't like that at all."" Another senior source said: ""There was an element of Gove and Hancock auditioning to be PM. But Raab did an excellent job. He earned everyone's respect by standing in, but not trying to be PM."" Others disagree. “We all know that Gove can be like that but during that period he categorically wasn’t,” said one, before adding. “Admittedly, I can’t say it was all peace and harmony...there was a bit of unease from the usual suspects and Cabinet colleagues had conversations with members who were being a little bit snippy.” A Government source said the claims were ""total nonsense"" and that the Cabinet ""really rallied together"", with no tension between the ""quad"" of senior ministers in charge in Mr Johnson's absence. It was on the evening of Thursday, March 26 that Mr Johnson  , telling the nation he had ""mild symptoms"" but was continuing to lead the Government while self-isolating. ""He was working from Rishi Sunak's office because it is below the flat in Number 11 where he and Carrie [Symonds] live,"" recalled one member of his team. ""The only people allowed to see him face to face were Martin Reynolds, his principal private secretary, and Lee Cain, his director of communications. ""There is a study and a private office with a door in between, and Martin and Lee would go into the other room and speak to him through the open door.""  Ms Symonds, Mr Johnson's fiancee, was   because she was heavily pregnant. But as his mandatory one-week self-isolation period neared its end, he was getting worse, not better. ""It was obvious he was getting more ill,"" said a source close to him. ""He was doing video messages for Twitter but he was taking five or six goes to get it right, where he is normally a one-take guy. Whenever people told him to take it easy, he kept saying: 'Strong like bull, strong like bull.' Except he wasn't. One time he said that and he beat his chest, which triggered an uncontrollable coughing fit."" Mr Johnson was having to manage without his most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, who had   on March 27, the day after the Prime Minister had tested positive, and remained there until April 13 after suffering Covid-like symptoms. By the evening of Friday, April 3 staff were so concerned about Mr Johnson that a doctor was called, and on the Sunday that followed he called his key staff to tell them he was going into hospital. At the time Downing Street said it was a ""precautionary measure"" – but behind the scenes it was a different story. ""There was such a change in him,"" said one member of his team. ""He wasn't fully engaging in conversations and he was detached."" Officials checked with him that he wanted Mr Raab, the Foreign Secretary,   if he became incapacitated. He confirmed that Mr Raab was ""100 per cent"" his choice. Mr Johnson's blood oxygen levels had fallen dangerously low, and by the next day, Monday, April 6, ""the doctors were telling us it was looking pretty grisly"", one source said. Nominally at least, the Prime Minister remained in charge of the country, but at around 5.30pm that day, while Mr Raab was taking a turn to host the daily Downing Street press conference, the phone on the desk of Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, rang.  Sir Mark, who had been watching the press conference with his deputy Helen MacNamara, James Slack, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, and Mr Reynolds, answered the call, which was from St Thomas's Hospital. ""It was one of the two Nicks that rang,"" said a senior source [Dr Nick Price and Prof Nick Hart were in charge of Mr Johnson's care]. ""They said they were going to move him to intensive care. They said it was a ghastly situation because it was 50/50 whether he would need to go onto a ventilator, and if he did go onto a ventilator it was 50/50 whether he would survive."" In fact, the survival odds for Covid patients who were intubated were even lower than that at the time. Another source said: ""Undoubtedly that Monday evening was the lowest point. Going to bed that night was a scary time because you didn't know what you were going to wake up to the next day."" After the phone call from the hospital, ""things moved incredibly quickly"", one insider recalled. After Mr Raab finished his press conference he was called into Sir Mark's office and told he was going to have to take over. Mr Cain had finished his own period of self-isolation that afternoon and drove to Downing Street, where he became ""the Prime Minister's mouth in absentia"", as one official described it. The official said: ""There was a fear that the PM could die and everybody was determined to keep the ship moving on. A Cabinet call was arranged so everyone could be updated."" One person who was in Number 10 at the time said: ""It was surreal when we found out – it hit us like a freight train. There weren't many of us in Downing Street that day because a lot of people were working from home, so there wasn't much time to process it. We just had to get on with the job in hand."" Mr Raab was sent onto the airwaves to reassure the nation that the Prime Minister was ""in safe hands"". At St Thomas's, opposite Parliament on the other side of the Thames, Mr Johnson was  , as he later said himself. He recalled in an interview last May that ""the bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction"" and that ""the doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong. They had a strategy to deal with a 'death of Stalin' type scenario. ""I was not in particularly brilliant shape, and I was aware there were contingency plans in place."" Back in Downing Street, staff avoided talking about what would happen if Mr Johnson died. ""They were pretty tough days,"" said one insider. ""We were trying to source PPE [personal protective equiopment] every morning. Meanwhile, the PM was getting a lot of oxygen and it was very scary for him. It wasn't until the Thursday that the messages from the hospital started to get more positive."" Along with Mr Raab, Mr Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor were the ministers at the forefront of running the country while Mr Johnson remained in hospital. One source said the balance between saving lives and saving the economy shifted when Mr Johnson was off sick. ""The debate started when the PM was in hospital,"" said the source. ""Sedwill was pro opening up. The two big political operators are the PM and the Chancellor and when the PM is away the officials gravitate towards the big beast who is left, who was the Chancellor."" Mr Raab was helped in Downing Street by Mr Reynolds, Mr Cain, Mr Slack and Isaac Levido, a pollster who had previously worked on the general election campaign and had been drafted in from the private sector to help out in the crisis. Mr Cain, a former tabloid journalist whose previous jobs famously included dressing in a chicken costume to taunt David Cameron during the 2010 election campaign, effectively stood in for Mr Johnson in key meetings by telling Mr Raab what the Prime Minister's thinking was on any given subject. ""Lee was cited on the papers that were being sent to Raab,"" said one source. ""He got every box that went to Raab, and in the same way that he would challenge things before they got to the PM, Lee did that for Raab. He was the intermediary."" Another source said: ""Lee was basically running the joint. Raab stepped in but Lee was very much running the Number 10 operation. He was in all of the key meetings with Raab, as the PM's right-hand man in the room, saying what the PM would have done. I can't recall anything on which he and Raab disagreed."" Mr Johnson was discharged from hospital on April 12, a week after he had been admitted, and  . Although no one knew it at the time, it was the same day as Mr Cummings was making   to ""test his eyesight"" before returning to London the next day. At Chequers, Mr Johnson was soon resuming work calls with, among others, the Queen and the then-US president, Donald Trump. Mr Trump  : ""He sounded incredible, he was ready to go – it's like the old Boris, tremendous energy, tremendous drive."" Mr Cummings, meanwhile, was becoming ever more evangelical about the benefits of lockdown. ""He had always been in favour of lockdown, and argued for doing it earlier than we did,"" said one former colleague. ""While he was off sick he read loads of stuff about pandemics and came back telling everyone that the countries that did best were the ones that locked down early and didn't unlock too soon. He said those countries lost fewer people and took a smaller hit to their economies."" Mr Johnson  , ""probably a week too early"", one aide now admits, and told the nation there were ""real signs now that we are passing through the peak"" of the virus. Two days later, his son Wilfred was born. So what effect did the Prime Minister’s darkest hour have on him?  “I do think it changed him,” said one friend of the Prime Minister. “He had been very hesitant about putting the country into lockdown, but after he came out of hospital it’s all been about protecting lives. “He started talking about how we could lose more people to Covid than we lost in the Second World War.” ""He was pretty determined before he went into hospital, and he was pretty determined when he came out,"" said one. ""The one obvious change was that he started talking a lot about how we were too fat as a country and  ."" Britain has already lost more people to the virus than died in the Blitz, but the war cost 450,000 British lives in total, or 0.94 per cent of the population, including 383,000 in the Armed Forces. To date, Covid has taken 125,000 lives, or around 0.2 per cent of the population. Those most loyal to Mr Johnson continue to hold to the official line that the events of last April made no difference to his policies. ""He was pretty determined before he went into hospital, and he was pretty determined when he came out,"" said one. ""The one obvious change was that he started talking a lot about how we were too fat as a country and  ."" Another Johnson loyalist said: “It didn’t change him at all. Both before and after he went into hospital he kept saying it was important the cure wasn’t worse than the virus.”",5
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2021/03/30/rating-f1-teams-bahrain-gp-red-bull-fastest-aston-martin-trouble/,sport,"The 2021 Formula One season is underway with a bang after arguably the  . For the first time since 2018 Mercedes have genuine competition at the front, this time from Red Bull. It is promising for a captivating season ahead and a  . But are Red Bull actually the quickest team? Will Mercedes and Hamilton need to be at the very top of their game just to compete, as was the case on Sunday? And what about the rest of the grid? Now that we've had a decent amount of competitive running, it is a little easier to see the overall picture.  We have carefully sifted through the numbers and data to work out who the real winners and losers of F1's opening weekend were, and what this means for the season ahead.  As well as qualifying and race performance, we looked at a team's overall position as well as their progress relative to a) their average last season and b) the first race last year. We have combined this to create a progress percentage on their raw pace.  The overall rankings, then, are as much a chart of improvement as anything, rather than the ""correct"" order. So, who should be quietly confident and who is facing a long season ahead? Even on the limited running we have seen so far, Haas look to be in a similar position to Williams in 2019. That is to say they will be hopelessly adrift of even the second slowest team for the entirety of the year.  Given that they say they are not developing the current VF21 at all this season and the fact that they have two rookies   and Nikita Mazepin, this will be a long and painful season. The primary aim will be to bring their young drivers up to speed but with so little experience behind the wheel of a car that looks problematic, you have to question the wisdom of this.  No team has moved further back since 2020 and that is likely to be the direction of travel throughout 2021, too.   -1.050% (10th) There is still a long way to go yet but this has been a troubling start to the  . As Racing Point last season they were probably the third quickest team, on balance, with their Mercedes W10 imitation. And just like the actual Mercedes team this year, there is no doubt they have moved backwards in the order.  Despite Lance Stroll making it into final qualifying, Aston Martin were the seventh quickest team in Bahrain on raw pace behind the usual back three of Alfa Romeo, Williams and Haas. They are some way down on their 2020 level, with midfield rivals McLaren, AlphaTauri and Ferrari all making progress of varying degrees.  Their race showing was a little better but they now face a dilemma. Ideally the 2022 regulation changes – and F1’s new era – should be the focus of their resources, but with a start this poor the team may need to put their efforts into making this car better or face a demoralising season. Force India were very good at in-season improvement and that quality looks needed here.   -0.404% (8th) The team formerly known as Renault now have Fernando Alonso at the helm. He did his best throughout the Bahrain Grand Prix, but the A521 looked sluggish. Esteban Ocon did not fare much better, either, finishing a lap down in 13th and behind both Alfa Romeo cars. The team have made absolute progress from last year (only three teams did not) but their relative progress – which is more important – is backwards.  Again, like Aston Martin they face the “development dilemma”. No team wants to struggle outside the points for an entire year, going backwards and not forwards. But resource may be best spent on working on their 2022 car.  There is still a chance that the team and drivers can understand the car and its behaviour better as the season goes on, but you do wonder if the Renault power unit is the primary cause of its lack of pace. In   we said that the window for Alpine this year could be anywhere between third and seventh. With McLaren, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and AlphaTauri all on the up, seventh looks the more likely outcome.   +0.167% (7th) With new owners and  , the hopes at Williams would have been to continue their progress and turn it into something tangible; creating a car that can occasionally score points. On the showing in Bahrain they may have moved forward a little in overall performance but they sit in a similar place to 2020, albeit moving ahead of Haas in the order.  George Russell again made it into Q2 whilst team-mate Nicholas Latifi did not. This could be a common theme again in 2021. On everything we have seen so far, Williams risk being caught in no man’s land in ninth place – well ahead of Haas behind but well behind of whoever is ahead, whether Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin or Alpine.  +0.516% (5th)  It appears that the new aero regulations for 2021 have affected Mercedes and Racing Point – with their low-rake philosophy – more than the other teams. This, combined with Red Bull making a big step forward with their car’s stability and overall performance, has set up a mouthwatering season ahead.  Ninth in the overall progress chart looks worse than it is , but that is largely due to a stellar season in 2020. The only way was down after that.  It will be interesting to see whether they focus much on developing the W12 or look towards next year. Still, unlike the smaller teams, they should have the resource to do both. Clearly, there are still some issues. Although the car looked a match for Red Bull in the hands of Hamilton in the race, a gap of four-tenths in qualifying will be a little concerning, even with 22 rounds left in the championship.   -0.435% (9th) After pre-season testing there was a hint that McLaren could have moved ahead of the midfield pack. On the weekend’s showing it does not look like they have managed that yet, with only a small absolute improvement from last year. This should not be cause for concern.  Their biggest concern will be looking at the teams directly behind them with Ferrari resurgent and AlphaTauri on the up, too. Their consistent pace and performances throughout a season were their strengths in 2020 and it should be the same this time, especially with Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo on board.   +0.160% (6th) Alfa Romeo top the progress charts, having made a huge step forward in raw pace from both their 2020 overall time and their performance in the first race of last season. For most of last year they were cut adrift with Haas and Williams but this year there should be much more chance of success: that is to say points.  Perhaps the Ferrari power unit has helped but Alfa Romeo will be one of the teams most pleased with their performance so far. Despite being the eighth fastest team in Bahrain – where they were last year –   it is not out of the question that they could prove obstacles for Alpine and Aston Martin in the next few races and beyond.   +1.331% (1st)  Like McLaren, Ferrari would have had hopes that they could leap ahead of the midfield pack on their own. Like McLaren, that does not look to be the case. After pre-season testing there were questions over whether they might even struggle to improve all that much on last year’s dismal showing. First impressions, however, look decent.  Charles Leclerc showed the car’s potential with fourth in qualifying, just a couple of tenths behind Valtteri Bottas in the second Mercedes. Carlos Sainz could have been closer too, but did not nail his Q3 lap. Sixth and eighth in the final reckoning is hardly reason to crack out the bubbly but given that this is a track which rewards power, then Ferrari can feel cautiously optimistic about the season ahead. It will be a tight fight with McLaren, but third place is a target.   +0.763% (4th)  Red Bull can leave Bahrain disappointed but happy overall. Their pre-season pace was not an illusion and they begin the season with the fastest car and a man capable of delivering the best from it in Max Verstappen. The worry will be whether they can keep up with Mercedes – or keep them at bay in qualifying – for very long.  The 0.388secs that separated Verstappen and Hamilton in qualifying was significant. But the performance gap between Red Bull and Mercedes was, well, almost impossible to call even after 56 laps. With so many races this year and a huge variety of tracks, it is likely we will see the order see-sawing but, whatever, the RB16B looks a seriously impressive car and already arguably their best of the turbo-hybrid era.  Development throughout the season has usually been their strong point. It has had to be, as the team have been painfully slow starters. The giants they have to fell in Hamilton and Mercedes are now within touching distance, but it appears that it will take a monumental effort to down them.  +0.782% (3rd) It might seem strange to have a team that only scored two points with one ninth place at the top of this list. That was the case with Racing Point after the first race of last year and it is the same with AlphaTauri this year. Their potential is enormous, but they did not deliver on it on Sunday.  Pierre Gasly has always gone well in Bahrain but qualifying fifth is a fantastic result. Yuki Tsunoda could have been up there as well – and he looks a serious prospect – but for a mistake in Q2. Gasly made contact with Daniel Ricciardo early on and that ruined his race, but it is not an exaggeration to say that they could cause headaches for Ferrari and McLaren this year on current form.  Going by the data, the Honda engine seems to be a massive upgrade on last year’s, which should serve them well. Aerodynamically the car – like its sister at Red Bull – appears compliant to the drivers’ will. There are many reasons to be excited for the Italian team this year.   +0.972% (2nd) ",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/03/31/womens-fa-cup-back-competitions-return-mired-controversy/,sport,"Barely a blink of an eye after lower-league clubs were allowed back in training, two teams will be immediately back into competitive action in the Women’s FA Cup on Wednesday, after a staggeringly short preparation time of just 48 hours since the lifting of restrictions on grassroots sport. Yet the teams involved have required great patience too. No fewer than 136 days since the first round was originally scheduled in the calendar, the one outstanding first-round tie between fourth-tier sides Kent Football United and Enfield Town will finally be contested  at 7.30pm. A further 31 teams now have less than a week to prepare for Sunday’s second round, prompting fears of injury risks for players. The cup's return will undoubtedly provide a huge boost mentally and physically for many, but the rapid resumption is controversial, with some players accusing the Football Association of asking them to “prop up” the cup while their leagues are cancelled. Stoke City have withdrawn from the competition, pulling out of Sunday’s second-round tie against Wem Town, and   understands the club did so because of health and safety concerns for their players. Those concerns centre around not only fears over Covid-19, with some of their players being key workers, but also around the potential injury risk. For the teams who will play, the cup is now all they have left this term, because their leagues have been curtailed. That’s angered some players, with Huddersfield Town’s Beth Stanfield reacting to their season’s cancellation by posting on social media:  Her team-mate Sarah Danby added rather sarcastically: However, others appear simply grateful to finally be able to play again. “I know some clubs are a bit aggrieved that the turnaround is so quick but if we want to play this competition we have to go with it and the players are hungry for it, we want to play,” said Kent Football United manager Sam MacNeil, whose side knocked out AFC Wimbledon in the previous round. “It is a challenging timetable and it’s probably not fair, but I fully respect the FA have got a very difficult job to do to manage this calendar. Given the lay-off that we’ve had, I think the team that can get on top of the game in the last 20 minutes, finish the game strongly and not burn yourself out too quickly, that’ll be important.” Kent have waited over a year for a home league game and have therefore decided to stream Wednesday’s behinds-closed-doors game live online, with MacNeil adding: “It’s an opportunity for both clubs to expose themselves to a wider audience than if we were just welcoming local supporters to the ground.” At one stage this winter, there were fears the cup might not resume at all for lower-league teams, with the FA’s director of the professional women’s game, Kelly Simmons, admitting to ITV News in January  “might be the only way” to resolve the situation, with the cup paused because of the government’s ban on ‘non-elite’ teams playing during lockdown. But at last, for the first time since January 3, the cup is back, and the only coins being tossed will be the referee’s before kick-off. The draw has already been conducted all the way up to the fourth round, where the winners of Kent and Enfield’s tie could eventually face Women’s Super League side West Ham United, if they can win three consecutive games, which MacNeil describes as a “massive motivation”, adding: “The holy grail is the fourth round and the carrot is even bigger this year because the draw has been carried out.” One second-round tie was completed in January, a  in front of a 150-strong crowd while England had a ‘tier system’ of restrictions regionally. With Stoke and Wem Town’s tie off, that leaves 16 of the original 18 second-round to take place on Sunday.  “Due to challenges created by Covid-19, the FA understands and has accepted Stoke City’s withdrawal from the competition,” an FA statement said. “As a result, Wem Town Ladies will receive a bye to the third round of the competition.” Following Stoke’s withdrawal, Shropshire-based club Wem Town know they have a third-round tie away to either Middlesbrough or Hull City on April 11, one win away from a potential tie against Championship side Sheffield United, and Wem’s manager Lawrence Wilson said: “My players can’t wait to get back on the grass, it’s been so long. “We haven’t played since December 18, so I was a bit shocked [to be playing so quickly after restarting training], I thought they might give us two weeks minimum, but it is what it is, everyone is in the same boat. Knowing the draw already, it is great motivation.”",2

The pandemic is ongoing but that has not stopped a record 23-race season being planned.  That said, the Australian Grand Prix, planned for mid-March, has already been postponed until November. This means that the season now starts on March 26 with first free practice for the Bahrain Grand Prix.  Read below for more information about the season, including winter testing, car launch dates and the full calendar.  A fair bit and not a lot. You should remember that 2021 was supposed to be the start of a new era for F1 as significant regulation – and budgetary – changes came into play. With the financial damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, however, F1 decided to put back the regulation changes until 2022. Budgetary requirements have still come in ( ) but the cars will, largely, be the same as last season with a few small but significant tweaks. The Pirelli tyres have a new construction for this season, too.  First and foremost, though, there are two ""new teams"". Or rather two teams that have new names. Renault have become Alpine and Racing Point have become Aston Martin.  The biggest and most significant change is the potential for three qualifying 'sprint' races, which would decide the grid order for Sunday's Grand Prix at the British, Italian and Brazilian rounds. Excluding any sprint race trials, the traditional four-day weekend – with Thursday usually reserved for various media duties – has been turned into a three-day event. The days of four hours worth of free practice are gone, too. Free practice one and two – previously 90 minutes each – will now only run for an hour. The 60 minutes of final practice on Saturday remains unchanged, though   rules will now apply after that session rather than after qualifying.  There are a couple of new and returning circuits for this season, too. The first comes with the   on September 5 (this was due to run in May last season) and also the inaugural  on the Jeddah Street Circuit.  On the driver side of things,  ,   and  make their debuts with Haas. Japan's   becomes the first full-time F1 driver to be born in the 21st century. Elsewhere,   moves to McLaren,   moves from McLaren to Ferrari and   lines up alongside Max Verstappen at Red Bull.  And, if you particularly care about that type of thing, both Mercedes and Aston Martin will share Safety and Medical Car duties. They have been given an update for 2021 and they look pretty neat, I reckon.  W12  RB16B  MCL35M : AMR21 A521  SF21 AT02  C41 VF21  : FW43B  If you are in the UK, you can watch every practice session, qualifying and race on Sky Sports F1. Highlights will be broadcast on Channel 4 on Saturday and Sunday evenings, with one race – likely the British Grand Prix – shown live.  If you are outside of the UK there is a good chance you will be able to subscribe to Formula One's own F1TV.  Yes, but with the coronavirus pandemic in many different stages throughout the world, we are unsure which races and how many fans. Certainly there is a good possibility that the British Grand Prix on July 18 will be able to welcome the usual hundreds of thousands of spectators, if the Government's roadmap for releasing restrictions is followed and all measures are done by June 21.  Naturally, the below dates come with the caveat that, due to the global coronavirus pandemic, these locations and dates could change. The Australian Grand Prix has already been postponed until November. Last season showed that circuits and organisers are there to step in at the last minute, so it is not unrealistic to expect a season as full as planned.   The current plan is also for fans to be allowed, in some capacity at least, but we will have to see how that goes. At the moment only those who have been fully vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid. The Azerbaijan Grand Prix will take place behind closed doors.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/formula-1/2021/03/29/red-bull-must-do-topple-lewis-hamilton-mercedes/,sport,"If pre-season testing hinted that Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton-led dominance could be under serious threat, then   highlighted it, underlined it, and then  .  Red Bull and Max Verstappen will be gutted with their failure to capitalise on a winning position under lights in the desert. They should be. Regardless of their current form, they have not had many chances to win in the past few years and whatever their performance advantage in Bahrain, it was not enough. After just 14 wins in 119 races, contending for a championship is a new experience for a lot of this Red Bull team. They must now assess what they can do in the next eight months and 22 grands prix to topple F1’s most dominant team and driver. Here's how they can do it. As a driver, Verstappen is arguably Hamilton’s only equal on the grid. Provided that he and Hamilton are close in the points table, this gives the title fight a totally different dimension — and may help force mistakes from the champion. In the past two years Hamilton  , which was done with ease. In 2017 and 2018 he was  , who managed to put Hamilton under pressure, only to implode himself. There is very little that Mercedes and Hamilton have not achieved in their eight years of dominance. But defeating a driver of truly comparable talent and skills in comparable machinery? That is yet to happen.  But, in this record-breakingly long season, Red Bull cannot afford to give Mercedes and Hamilton a head start. They must repeat the intensity (but not the outcome) of their first race of the 2021 season. The seven and 13 points that Verstappen and Red Bull are behind respectively is neither here nor there, but if that morphs to 20 or 30 points in four or five rounds time – however close those races are – then Mercedes are back in their usual spot, which is where Hamilton feels comfortable.  For the past two years Red Bull have been fighting with one hand tied behind their back as first Pierre Gasly and then Alexander Albon failed to match Verstappen in qualifying and races. Can Sergio Pérez do any better? If Red Bull want to take their chances, he has to.  In fairness, he does not even have to match Verstappen, but he absolutely must be a factor at the front of the race and be close enough to him or both Hamilton and Bottas to stop Mercedes having two strategy options to cover the Dutchman. This was evident on Sunday: had Mercedes not botched Bottas’s second pit stop then Verstappen’s charge to the front would have been harder.  Pérez looked some way off Verstappen this weekend, but this is only his first race for the team. Red Bull should bear some responsibility for his lowly starting position after taking a risk on tyre choice in qualifying, but at worst he needs to be starting fourth and keeping both Mercedes honest.  Red Bull have been notoriously slow starters and have never truly challenged Mercedes dominance over a season. The last time Red Bull took pole position at the first race of the year was in 2013. The last time they had a car finish in the top two on its first outing? 2012. For the first time in the turbo-hybrid era, they are out of the blocks as contenders. It usually takes a while for them to walk the walk after talking the talk.  If the teams are as close as it seems then a development dilemma occurs for both of them. Do they plough resource into a tight championship fight or focus on the massive regulation changes for next year’s car? Fortunately, Red Bull’s development path is usually steep because it has had to be. Last year Mercedes stopped developing their 2021 car after seven rounds – this year they may be forced into a different approach.  Having the quickest car over one lap is a good start, but it is not enough. We know that from Ferrari's failed attempts in 2017 and 2018 and towards the end of 2019 (although the titles were all but decided). Hamilton has experienced this too, in his first year at Mercedes in 2013, when the team had a run of eight pole positions in nine races but only triumphed in three of them.  With these heavy, super high-downforce beasts, track position is important, as Hamilton proved. But a race is won on Sunday, not Saturday. It could become a sore point quickly if Verstappen continues to take pole positions yet is beaten by Hamilton on race day. Clearly, that cannot happen. It looks like Red Bull have the advantage in raw pace – perhaps even a hefty one in Verstappen’s hands – but there was little to separate them in the race on Sunday at any point. ",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2021/03/31/englands-winter-winners-losers-mark-wood-proves-worth-dom-bess/,sport,"England’s mixed bag of a winter has finally come to a close. The tour to Sri Lanka was a resounding success, while the India leg was unsurprisingly more challenging. Which individuals improved their reputation and whose stock has fallen?  Going into the Sri Lanka tour, Leach was vying with Dom Bess to be England's No 1 Test match spinner after spending most of the English summer watching his team-mates play. Following his showing in India in particular, Leach is undoubtedly England’s premier spinner. The left-armer grew into the tour, finding increasing levels of accuracy and taking wickets at regular intervals. Leach's domination of   was particularly impressive; Leach dismissed Pujara four times in the series - no spinner had ever dismissed the obdurate No 3 more than three times in a single series before. If Leach had not bowled so well to one of India’s key batsmen, the tour could have been even more one-sided. In total Leach took 28 wickets in six Tests at 31.14 apiece. It was not a return to suggest England have found their next great spinner, but it was enough to prove he is good enough to perform at Test level and is ahead of the competition. If anyone needed reminding what a special talent Wood is, this winter hammered it home. Wood   albeit for little reward, but it was the limited-overs series in India where he really came alive. The Durham quick was not a guaranteed starter in England’s T20 side but he well and truly is now. Wood  . His average speed of 91.23mph in the first T20 was the fastest ever recorded by an England bowler in a T20I. Although his speed was eye-catching, it was Wood’s ability to take wickets in the Powerplay and to bowl economically in the middle overs that was most impressive. England now know more than ever that they need Wood to be fit for the T20 World Cup and the Ashes.  The England captain’s quiet last three Tests with the bat  . He scored 426 runs in just two Tests against Sri Lanka and averaged 46 against India including a second double hundred of the winter. To provide some context, Root’s overall tally of 794 runs is the most registered by an England batsman in an away winter since Ken Barrington's 876 in 1962/63. Root had been criticised for failing to convert into big scores and there was a suggestion he was no longer in the top echelon of batsmen with Steve Smith, Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson.  But he silenced the critics with his   and even chipped in with a  . For Root the batsman, this was the winter he needed.  Poor Bess. What a miserable winter he ended up having - and it was not all his fault by any means. Purely looking at the statistics, Bess had a reasonable winter. He took 17 wickets at 26.6 apiece from four matches - a significantly better return per game than his former Somerset team-mate Leach.  However, his expected average -   - was worse than Leach's. It was clear that England did not trust Bess to perform by the India series. He played in just two of the Tests, dropped for Moeen Ali on one occasion with no second spinner preferred on the other. His omissions were understandable. Bess bowled 44 full tosses across the four matches he played this winter. No England spinner on record (2006-present) has bowled more full tosses in a single season. His inability to find his line and length with any sort of regularity must have been infuriating for Root.  It feels as if Bess has regressed significantly after a promising start to his international career.  will be a delicate process.  Burns missed the tour to Sri Lanka, then played the first two Tests in India before being dropped for the remainder of the series. The left-hander looked out of his depth against spin. Burns was dismissed three times against spin, having only faced 61 balls from spinners in the two matches he played. Overall, the 30-year-old scored just 58 runs at an average of 14.5. Given Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley are significantly younger than Burns, England could choose to move away from Burns altogether. That would require one of  in English conditions. Depending on what the selectors opt for, this winter could have been Burns' last action in an England shirt. After all, the Surrey opener  . An underwhelming return given the amount of international cricket he has played. The elder Curran’s place as a squad member in England’s limited-overs setup is under serious threat after a poor showing in the three matches he played. The Surrey seamer has struggled for a while at international level and that continued against India. In the one T20 he played, Curran went at 13 runs an over while in the two ODIs his economy was over seven. Curran now has a career economy rate of 9.31 in T20Is, the highest of any England bowler ever to bowl 200+ balls in the format. The   has not helped Curran’s status while Tymal Mills is a player from outside the squad who could threaten Curran’s T20 place due his ability to perform a similar death overs role. The next time Curran is presented with an opportunity, he needs to take it.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2021/03/31/england-selectors-sending-wrong-message-players-anyone-ever/,sport,"England are being paranoid if they think their players will  . Ashley Giles told my show on the BBC this week that England do not want to go “toe-to-toe” with players over the IPL because in the long run “we may face losing some of our best players”. I think that is a wrong message to be sending. If an England player came to me aged 26 or 27 and said he was choosing the IPL and franchise cricket over an England deal my response would be simple, “Go on then, see you later, goodbye, but I tell you what, I bet you come knocking back on my door in a year or two's time”.  If England really want to make sure it does not happen then why not offer their best players two or three year central contracts? High-level sport is about looking after the best individuals so  . That way you are tying them down. Instead they have 12-month deals. But I do not get the impression from the camp that England’s leading players would turn down playing for their country. I’ve not heard of anyone rocking the boat. Playing for England means everything. I feel this England group are as committed to drive the team forward as any of their predecessors. I am not inside the dressing room so I don’t know the conversations, and perhaps there are agents threatening stuff, but I see a commitment to the cause. They demand everyone buys into a set of principles. Any individual who goes away from those gets brought back into line by players, not the management. They have a strong group of senior players who know what they are about and what they want. They don’t want idiots in the team or people who put something else first before England. They are a hard-working, dynamic group. I have heard they were willing to come back in May and leave the IPL to prepare for the New Zealand Test series.  . They want to play at Lord’s in front of fans starved of cricket for 12 months. The New Zealand series has been added to the schedule late, but so what? This Test team needs to develop by playing together and winning. If you want to win an Ashes, you have to have those shared experiences and become a better side. That is more important than a few more IPL games. If we reach the stage where a player turns down a central contract for a franchise then cricket will be going the same way as football. It will be the moment when we say goodbye to international cricket as it is now. In years to come we will say, 'that was the day when international cricket became second class to franchise formats'. The Premier League is a better product than international football, other than World Cups and European Championships. You get the feeling in football players try to pull out of friendlies and the fans feel like they are missing out when international weeks are on because the Premier League is on hold.  Cricket is not there yet but it could happen. This is why boards need to realise how powerful they are. I accept that countries like Bangladesh, New Zealand and West Indies might not be able to pay their players enough to prevent them putting franchise cricket first.  But that is not the case for England. The ECB contract brings you pastoral care, medical insurance, they look after your family really well and a guarantee of 12 months income. Your commercial value in this country derives from being an England player. They can also still play a big chunk of the IPL and earn money on the side. Ten years ago that was not the case so there was a risk of a player turning down a central contract but England have managed it well since then. I just don’t know where this has come from.  I just wonder if there is more to this. Have England  just realised they made a mistake by allowing the players to commit to a full IPL and are now trying to justify it in their own minds? Something about this just doesn't make sense to me.",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/0/england-euro-2020-squad-2021-verdict-premier-league-players/,sport,"Gareth Southgate revealed at the weekend he would be keeping in touch with players during the next two months to make sure . There will be some tough decisions as his current squad has 24 players and there are others returning from injury.  will be casting a weekly eye over those impressing every week to gauge the strength of the squad before June. As so often with goalkeepers who are sidelined, their standing can improve when they are not playing. Nick Pope had nothing to do against Albania but his kicking was poor, not helped by the poor surface at Arena Kombëtare. Pickford’s distribution puts him back up to No1, with Pope providing back-up.   His place in the squad is solidified by  . Southgate thought Walker was a strong enough character to miss out on being in the matchday squad against San Marino and come back against Albania, where he played as an orthodox right-back. Playing as wing-back or centre-back puts him in a good position to be selected.  Putting a case forward to be first-choice at left-back when the Euros start. His assist for Harry Kane in Albania shows the attacking quality he has and he looked untroubled defending. “The last two years I’ve been watching the games and regretting not being able to take my chances when I had them,” he said. He is currently seizing his opportunity.  It looks like a battle between the Wolves captain and Tyrone Mings. Both big personalities in the changing room and both leaders. But taking just one of them allows Southgate to pick another attacker, and Walker gives cover at centre-back if needed. Coady  , which shows how highly regarded he is by Southgate.  Southgate managed his workload so he was given 45 minutes against San Marino, allowing him to play against Albania for the full 90,  . His form means he goes to the tournament and has a good chance of starting games.  Never looked in trouble against Albania after getting a rest against San Marino. He is approaching 50 games this season but says he feels fresh.  “Burnout is not something I've thought about, I don't look into the negative thoughts,” he said. “I see it as a positive that I've played so many games, I'm working hard when I'm not playing on looking after myself and mentally and physically I feel like I'm in a good place.”  Borussia Dortmund forward is still injured but was in great form before being ruled out. Jesse Lingard came in and played well against San Marino but Southgate did admit the West Ham midfielder was one of the more fortunate to get a recall. Sancho’s pace will still be a huge asset to England at the finals.  Southgate cannot count on the Liverpool captain being fit but the player himself is optimistic about recovering from  his adductor injury. Southgate says his inclusion will depend on his full recovery. Jude Bellingham offers a glimpse of the future in that role and Southgate will not want to take a semi-fit player with him to a tournament.  Showed his class with a fine header against Albania and then setting up Mason Mount to seal the win. Southgate will want him protected from now until the finals, praying he does not pick up an injury.  .  Just when you think he is having a quiet game, he pops up with an incredible cross for Kane to hit the crossbar. Then he won the ball in Albania territory for Mount’s second goal. Southgate highlighted his goal record in the last 15 games, scoring 12 goals, to show how important he is to the team.   Felt a muscle twinge playing against AC Milan in the Europa League just before meeting up and eventually pulled out. Has only played a game and a half for England this season and Southgate will be worried that he has not played enough in his system heading into a tournament, but his quality means he will be in the squad if fit.  Southgate has the right-back at the top of La Liga as well as the Walker being top of the Premier League. Trippier only played 45 minutes against San Marino and will hoping for more action against Poland before heading back to his club.  Difficult to assess a goalkeeper who has not had a save to make in two games but his kicking was poor against Albania and England will look more efficient with Pickford in goal starting attacks with the ball at his feet.  Pulled out of the international break through injury but has impressed the coaching staff this and has put himself in a good position to be included. He can play in any position on the left flank and could probably play in the centre as well. It makes him a valuable member of the squad, even if he is one for the future. Has the potential to be one of the emerging talents of the tournament.   He was excellent against Albania, moving the ball forward positively and breaking up attacks with interceptions. His control over games will be vital for England during the tournament and he will be looking to replicate his form in the Premier League onto the international stage.  Hit the post against Albania and played well despite a lack of space in the midfield. He has started three out of the last four Manchester City games and is getting a good number of minutes under his belt ahead of the tournament. Makes an impact when he gets on the pitch and has a fearlessness that will give England an extra edge in the tournament.   Southgate says people are starting to take notice of Mount now Thomas Tuchel is putting faith in him at Chelsea. He scored with a cool finish against Albania and has impressed senior members of the squad with his ability to knit attacks together. He can also play in a deeper position against weaker opposition which would allow another attacker in the starting line-up.  His goals this season puts him in the best position to be Kane’s back-up. Ollie Watkins can push the Everton striker all the way in the battle to get to the Euros and there is still James Maddison to come back from injury.  Would have been in the England squad if fit. There has to be a place in the squad for Grealish after his performances this season. His ball-carrying will be an important part of England making an impression on the tournament. He has missed out on this international break but has done enough through the season.   Played in the San Marino game before making way for Luke Shaw. Will be an interesting battle to see who starts against Croatia in the first game of the tournament. Shaw is getting more minutes at club level but Chilwell has incredible stamina to add himself to attacks.  Best option to cover for Henderson when the Liverpool captain does not play, giving more control and better movement in comparison to Eric Dier moving into midfield. Bellingham’s emergence gives another option to Southgate though but the Leeds United midfielder warrants a place in the final squad.  Played against San Marino instead of going to the Under-21 Euros this week, showing that Southgate wants him for the summer. He will benefit from the experience of a senior tournament in the same way Rio Ferdinand did at Euro 96, although Bellingham will get a place in the squad rather than just be invited to train.  It was significant that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer picked him ahead of David De Gea for the Leicester defeat, in which he could do little about the goals and was let down by the players in front of him. Sam Johnstone will be looking to impress during the next 10 days after replacing Pickford. ",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2021/03/15/martin-johnson-tribute-press-box-legend-brought-laughter-wherever/,sport,"The last time I spoke to Martin Johnson over the phone, I found myself crying with laughter on the train into London. It was a familiar experience for those lucky enough to know the ultimate raconteur of British sport – a man who was even funnier in person than he was in print. Johnson - who has died at the age of 71 - wrote for the Daily Telegraph between 1995 and 2008. It was the centrepiece of a magnificent career that began at the Leicester Mercury in the 1970s and also included sizeable stints at the Independent - where he made his first foray into Fleet Street - and latterly at the Sunday Times. Even amidst the eccentricities of the press box, Johnson was one of a kind: a correspondent who could skewer the shortcomings of a team or athlete as accurately as any straight news reporter, yet do it while simultaneously triggering a belly laugh. He had so many great moments, but the stand-outs tend to involve England cricket tours, for that was the sport which prompted his finest work. In the winter of 1986-87, as Mike Gatting’s Ashes tourists stumbled through their warm-up matches, he famously wrote that “There are only three things wrong with this England team: they can’t bat, they can’t bowl and they can’t field.”  When I rang him in 2017, while preparing a historical piece on Gatting’s Ashes, he expressed wonderment at the way his quip has lived on. “It’s extraordinary how the “Can’t bat, can’t bowl, can’t field” thing survives, like finding somebody’s teeth in a pile of ashes,” said Johnson, who was used to being asked to wheel out his memories of the tour. “It must be like being an impressionist, like Alistair McGowan, and being asked to do your Harold Wilson every time you go to dinner.” The other central story from his days on the cricket trail dates from the 1996-97 tour of Zimbabwe - a particularly ill-fated trip - where his clear-eyed questioning provoked the then England coach David “Bumble” Lloyd into a notorious outburst. “England had just drawn with Zimbabwe with scores level,” recalled Peter Hayter, a great friend of Johnson’s who was then covering cricket for the Mail on Sunday. “The mood at the post-match press conference was prickly, to put it mildly. Mike Atherton [then England captain] was eyeballing Martin, and Bumble suddenly burst out saying ‘We flippin’ murdered ’em, everybody knows that.’ Martin had the last laugh, as ever. He wrote that ‘When you’re murdering a person it’s advisable to make sure they’re no longer breathing.’” As it happened, Atherton simmered down and knocked on Johnson’s door that evening with a bottle of wine, which they shared in a mood of reconciliation. And neither was he the only England captain to make up with Johnson in this way after reacting angrily to one of his barbs. David Gower - a man so easy-going that he would sometimes be viewed as a dilettante - was once moved to threaten litigation over the suggestion that his leadership might be improved by a frontal lobotomy “Even I, having known him so long, took exception,” recalled Gower, whose apprenticeship at Leicestershire had coincided with Johnson’s days on the county beat. “We got a lawyer to write a letter to the sports editor of the Independent threatening to close them down if an apology wasn’t made. Martin rang me, said ‘What’s going on?’ I said ‘I want a bottle of champagne, make it a magnum. I want you to deliver it to my home and then we can drink it. It was a suitably amicable settlement out of court, and certainly didn’t cloud our friendship. “Martin was a writer of great skill, and he wrote primarily to entertain himself,” added Gower. “He was also fiercely independent and wasn’t afraid to put the boot in. Mike Turner [Leicestershire’s chief executive] would look enviously at Leicester City football club up the road and note that when they lost 6-0, the report would say they were unlucky, because the football reporter was almost a PR man on the club staff. Turner once asked me to speak to Martin about it, but as soon as we got to the bar for a chat, he turned to me and said ‘Quiet word – if it’s about what I am writing for the Mercury, don’t bother.’” Johnson was not famed as a news-getter - and indeed within the press box he was known ironically as “Scoop”. He could be accident-prone, as when the Telegraph sent him to cover a heavyweight boxing bout between Lennox Lewis and Ray Mercer. Having arrived at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in search of his ring-side seat, Johnson was told that he was at the wrong venue, and the fight was way out east. “East side of town?” he replied. “No sir, east as in East Coast.” It was actually being staged in New York. Yet he was certainly much more than just a gags man. He was an astute observer of sport in general, and an enthusiastic participant - particularly on the golf course, where his distinctive, Sid James-ish cackle would ring out whenever a shot went astray. “Our games with Chris Lander [the former Daily Mirror cricket correspondent] and others were often comedy classics,” recalled Hayter. “I’ve seen him laugh so hard that he would literally clutch his sides in pain.” That was my experience, too, when I last rang him and he re-enacted a scene from the 1987 cricket World Cup involving the food parcels that Tesco sent to the England team to keep their spirits up through five weeks on the Indian sub-continent. “There was a giant wheel of camembert, which mysteriously disappeared into Mike Gatting’s hotel room,” Johnson recalled. “John Emburey was banging on the door, saying ‘He’s got the cheese in there!’” At the time, Gatting might occasionally have felt exasperated by Johnson’s one-liners - which included the observation that “How anyone can spin a ball the width of Gatting boggles the mind” after Shane Warne’s wonder-ball of 1993. But he has fond memories of “a man with a very sharp, very dry sense of humour. The press used to put on a little play or sketch show at Christmas, when we travelled to Australia, and Martin used to write all the best lines.” There were so many to choose from. Johnson was particularly good on run-ups. For Merv Hughes, he wrote that “his mincing run-up resembles someone in high heels and a panty girdle chasing after a bus,” while Angus Fraser “looked like a man who had got his braces caught on the sightscreen.” , who - at the height of the 1990 panic over Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis - was described as suffering from “a virulent case of Boiling Scotsman Eruptus”. I can only encourage lovers of Johnson’s prose to search out his books - there are collections both of his rugby and cricket writing available second-hand, while a more recent compendium   was published by Constable in 2015.  Johnson died at the weekend after a long illness. Few men in our business have brought so much joy to so many.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/athletics/2021/03/03/unstoppable-rise-super-shoe-caused-mayhem-athletics/,sport,"By the start of 2020, it was evident something was afoot. By World Athletics president Seb Coe’s admission, the governing body had “been chasing the horse around the paddock” in failing to react quickly enough to developments in road-running shoes and it was too late. Nike’s technological innovations had changed the marathon landscape forever and no elite runner would ever take the start line again without some combination of carbon fibre and hyper-responsive foam under the soles of their feet. The horse had bolted. Now the governing body had a secondary problem of attempting to shut the door on the same happening on the track. Little more than a year on, its failure to do so has been brought into sharp focus and threatened to overshadow much of what will take place at the Olympics this summer. Courtesy of previously unheralded athletes making headlines with astounding performances during the indoor season, fissures that had been bubbling under the surface have developed into full-blown divisions as debate blights the sport and world records become sitting ducks. Behind it lies a secretive world of non-disclosure agreements, cutting-edge technology and warring shoe companies, battling to help runners achieve feats many thought impossible. Many people, including some within the footwear industry, believe it should never have come to this. Until January 2020, regulations on sole thickness had only ever existed in the high jump and long jump, with most track spikes so thin and lightweight that further limitations were not necessary. But with shoe companies seeing the radical impact of marrying carbon-fibre plates with super-springy foam, prototypes for middle- and long-distance track spikes had emerged a few months earlier at the 2019 World Championships that suggested all that was about to change and limitations were quickly needed. Where track spikes had rarely exceeded 15 millimetres in thickness in the past, World Athletics introduced a blanket 30mm sole thickness rule, later amended to 25mm for all track events beyond 400 metres. The reason for not going thinner was the existence of one particular thick-soled Nike spike rarely worn outside the American collegiate system. “That was what created everything you see now,” one leading shoe company executive told  . “It means you have all this room for plates and bounceability. “The parameters are out of control. They should never have been what they are, but now we have them we are going to work with them. “We’re going to have a period of two or three years where you have phenomenal athletes - let’s not belittle them - that are given a product that is definitely going to make them run faster. There will be faster times and records falling. In the short term it’s going to be mayhem.” Barely an athletics competition has gone by this year without proof. Fresh from new women’s 5,000m, and men’s 5,000m and 10,000m world records during last year’s brief outdoor season, the past month has seen times continue to tumble in middle and long-distance events. One men’s 3,000m race saw a 23-year-old world record missed by just 0.08 seconds as the first four Nike-sponsored finishers all moved into the top eight of the all-time world rankings. Nike-sponsored British athlete Elliot Giles, who has never reached a world final, smashed Coe’s national 800m record by more than a second with the second-fastest indoor time in history. And Nike-sponsored Marc Scott took 46 seconds off his 10,000m personal best to move second behind only Mo Farah on the all-time British rankings. For many people - and no one more than the athletes themselves - the astonishing performances are reflective of hard work in training, the rare benefit of time during global Covid lockdowns, and peaking at the start of an Olympic year. But all have revolutionary shoes as a common factor. The fast times of the past are destined to be consigned to history. As Geoff Burns, a biomechanics expert at the University of Michigan, says: “It’s like there are these gems that through all of our history we thought were super rare but now we’ve found a deposit of them that makes them a little bit less valuable. “This year will be the equivalent of the move from cinder to all-weather tracks. It’s a generational shift.” Olympian and scientist Shalaya Kipp knew she was witnessing something that would change the marathon picture forever the moment she began “top-secret” testing of the latest Nike prototype road-running shoes. It was early 2016 and the first edition of what would become the Nike Vaporfly 4% was being put through its paces at the University of Colorado. Kipp, along with everyone else in the laboratory, was made to sign a non-disclosure agreement, preventing loose tongues causing details of the secret shoe to emerge. “We started referring to the prototype as ‘The Magic’ in the lab because it was crazy,” says Kipp. “It improved the running economy of every single participant we put in these shoes. It didn’t matter if they hated the shoe or not. The smallest change we saw was two per cent and the biggest six per cent.” There were two key components that marked the shoe out for such controversial greatness: a carbon-fibre plate and a new super-responsive foam. While the former was nothing new in isolation - carbon-fibre plates had been used in road-running shoes for well over a decade - it was the interaction with the new Pebax foam (which Nike called ZoomX) that changed everything. “For a long time we had EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) foams and they were pretty bad,” explains Wouter Hoogkamer, assistant biomechanics professor at the University of Massachusetts. “They were either soft and so you lost all the energy, or they had to be made really firm so you didn’t lose it. The result was minimal thicknesses for road shoes and track spikes. “Adidas came along with Boost foam around 2013, which allowed a softer foam that gave more energy return. Now with the Pebax foam you have even more of that.” A few months after the laboratory testing, the men’s Olympic marathon produced a Nike podium clean sweep through Kenya’s Eliud Kipchoge, Feyisa Lilesa of Ethiopia and American Galen Rupp. Disguised to look like the rest of the existing Nike footwear range, all three men were in fact secretly wearing the Vaporfly 4% prototype. “We were watching and knew exactly what was going on,” says Kipp. What happened next is well-known. Almost every podium at every major marathon between 2017 and 2019 was filled by Nike-sponsored athletes in Vaporfly 4% and Next% shoes, with some athletes affiliated to other companies attempting to paint over the Nike branding after jumping ship to use their rival’s shoes. Kipchoge would first smash the world record in 2018, before donning the latest iteration of the shoe - the Alphafly - to become the first man to run a marathon in less than two hours, albeit under highly-controlled conditions. Nike athlete Brigid Kosgei also obliterated Paula Radcliffe’s longstanding women’s marathon world record. Athletes running in rival shoes simply stood no chance. “It was guns versus knives,” says Burns. Asked for their reaction to such inequality, Nike make no apologies for their ability to produce better shoes than their rivals. “Plates, foam and air are not new ingredients in running shoes or spikes, we’re just smarter about how we engineer and assemble them,” a spokesperson told  . Four years on, the situation is rather different, with other shoe companies catching up. Three of the four winners at last December’s Valencia Marathon and Half-Marathon wore the Adizero Adios Pro, which uses carbon-infused rods laid out to mimic the skeleton under the forefoot, and a carbon-fibre plate in the heel. One of the athletes, Kibiwott Kandie, broke the half-marathon world record. After years of a mismatch between Nike road-running shoes and the rest, New Balance, Reebok, Saucony, On, Brooks, Hoka and Asics have now all released their own ‘super shoes’. The playing field is distorted from history, but it once again vaguely resembles something level among current athletes. “There really hasn’t been a ton of innovation in track products for a long time,” says Danny Orr, New Balance general manager for running technology. “It’s always been a little bit around, ‘can it weigh as little as possible’ and, ‘can it have as much traction as possible’. “For as long as I’ve been doing this, that’s all that has come the way of track athletes. So it does feel for the first time in 20 years there’s innovation in this space, which is exciting.” While the outside world was  , shoe companies had realised the technological advances could now be used to conquer the second frontier of track athletics. Prototypes, primarily from Nike, using the same technology began appearing with semi-regularity after Rupp is believed to have worn a pair in finishing fifth at the 2016 Rio Olympics. By the 2019 World Championships, the finished product was almost complete with a number of Nike athletes - including gold medal winners Sifan Hassan and Donavan Brazier - producing outstanding performances in prototype shoes that would later turn into the Air Zoom Victory, with its carbon-fibre plate and air pod, and ZoomX Dragonfly, which features a rigid Pebax plate. World Athletics had a decision to make. Track competition was on the brink of following road running, which had been blighted by accusations of technological doping. The question was whether the sport should follow the lead of swimming, which banned Speedo’s shark-inspired suits that saw world records tumble in 2008, or the likes of cycling, which encourages innovations in bikes, suits and helmets. An added factor for the governing body was balancing what many perceived as the integrity of pure competition against the requirements of the shoe companies that provide athletics its main source of income. “There is a built-in dynamic, where shoe companies mercifully are still investing a lot of money into the research and development of shoes,” said Coe, who relinquished a long-term Nike ambassadorial role in 2015. “I’m pleased they are doing that.” Under pressure from Nike, World Athletics opted for a 20mm sole thickness limit on events up to 400m and 25mm for longer distances. “They didn’t need to go to that extreme, but Nike argued there was already a shoe of that thickness in existence,” said one leading sports brand executive. “That was not a shoe that anyone wore in elite competition, but Nike said it had been worn at college level in America, so that was the basis for the rules we now have.” Another shoe company executive said: “Brands are always going to innovate. Half the blame is laid at the feet of our international governing body who have not set the best guidelines for the last couple of years on shoe tech. “We knew back in 2016/17 that this was coming through so they could have set ground rules right from the start. It was only 2020 that this started getting put in place and it’s still a moving feast.” Having taken charge of athletics at a time when it was riddled with corruption and doping scandals, there remains a sense that Coe and his staff were simply unable to prioritise the shoe issue until it was too late. A World Athletics spokesperson said: “Perhaps we should have responded quicker by bringing the shoe companies together, as we did in late 2019, but we would have followed the same process and set the same principles we are working to now. “Our role as the regulator of our sport includes embracing innovation that helps athletes train and perform to their talented best whilst balancing that with fair play and reasonable access to new technology. “Against a backdrop of light touch regulation in the past it was always going to take time for a critical mass of the race results to work through to a point where World Athletics felt it was time to intervene in a more proactive manner.” On the 25mm limit, they added: “The maximum track shoe height was 25mm for a shoe that had been widely used for many years and was still being used across the athlete college system in the USA.” For those who have benefited from Nike’s spikes, it is galling to hear suggestions that the footwear is responsible for their achievements. Giles described such statements as an “insult”, while Scott said sceptics should get off their “high horse” after his huge 10,000m personal best. Others have been more forthcoming. Adidas-sponsored Jamie Webb, who also went under Coe’s old British record wearing ‘old technology’ spikes when finishing second behind Giles this month, said the evidence shows “we are entering a new era”. New Zealand’s double Olympic 1,500m medalist Nick Willis, who no longer has a footwear contract, last month revealed he ran a 1,200m time trial two seconds quicker than he expected when trying out New Balance’s carbon-fibre Fuelcell MDx spikes. “I’m a believer in the new spike tech,” he said. “Far different to anything I have run in for my 20 years racing the mile.” To date, only New Balance and Nike have provided athletes with ‘super spikes’ in competition over the past 12 months, with Joshua Cheptegei and Letesenbet Gidey smashing world records in the Nike ZoomX Dragonfly last summer. But any sense of inequality looks likely to be quashed by this summer, with Adidas, Brooks and Puma among shoe manufacturers due to bring out new ranges for the outdoor season featuring the carbon-fibre and super-responsive foam combination. While various numerical estimates have been thrown around, the question remains over exactly how much improvement the shoes provide, especially given the surprising identity of some of the athletes producing such remarkable times this winter: Giles has never made a global final, while two unheralded US college students catapulted themselves to seventh and eighth on the all-time indoor mile list. Asked if there was any sense of percentage improvements, Nike simply said: “We are pleased with the results we have seen to date.” Indeed, it is difficult to put a precise figure on it. So too with the often-compared move from cinder to all-weather tracks in the 1960s. Biomechanists believe that change provided around a 1.5 per cent advantage, but such was the effect of weather conditions on the cinder that there is no definitive number. Of the spikes, Hoogkamer explains: “For marathon running, we can deduce that if you run a marathon at a certain pace you can do trials in six different shoes in the lab setting. But running 800m race pace is hard enough once, so you can’t do the same trial comparisons. “The other thing is the marathon relies on aerobic capacity, which we can measure through oxygen uptake. For these middle-distances you get a huge amount of anaerobic contributions, which we still don’t know how to quantify. So measuring running economy at middle-distance race pace misses out all the anaerobic contributions. There’s no lab measure.” Orr concurs it is “harder to put your finger on” due to the difficulty in measuring, but says the New Balance spikes produce “some of the most consistent data we’ve seen”. All signs suggest what we have seen is just the start. Burns says the difference produced by this new shoe technology will likely prove more noticeable on the track than it has been on the road, forcing us to recalibrate how we perceive certain times. “For starters, you race a lot more so the data set is larger,” he said. “And the conditions are hyper-controlled. On the roads you have lots of external factors to deal with and people tend to race only twice a year. “In running we have associations with certain times - we have intrinsic connections to clocked performances. We’re basically seeing the distribution of those performances shift. “What that means is the performances we associate with being rare and exciting are going to be a little less rare. Very quickly we are going to come habituated to those times becoming a bit less special.” A second horse has bolted. World Athletics is currently looking into creating a formula that measures energy return, to potentially impose limitations through that route - rather than specific physical constraints - in the future. How to implement such regulations is tricky though, and such is the time-lag in shoe production that any radical rule changes would likely take years to put in place. The spikes are here to stay and will dominate middle- and long-distance races at the Tokyo Olympics, although with technological advances yet to be fully harnessed in sprint disciplines the likes of Usain Bolt’s 100m world record looks safe for now. Nike’s innovative Viperfly sprint spike unveiled last year is believed to have   but did not adhere to World Athletics regulations and has now been ditched having never been used in competition. A new legal version may yet appear before the Olympics, and New Balance - whose Fuelcell SDx spikes have helped Holland’s Femke Bol run the four fastest 400m times in Europe this year - also have designs on making a new short sprint spike legal by the Tokyo Games. Coe, who set 12 world records during his career, remains sanguine - publicly, at least - about complaints that the spikes make a mockery of comparisons with previous eras, insisting, “we shouldn’t be in the business of trying to suffocate innovation”. He said: “I don’t think we've reached that point where world records are being handed out like confetti. World records do matter. They need to be cherished. They need to be things that the world looks at and thinks, ‘That’s a new benchmark, and a suffusion of skill, talent, hard work and great coaching’. “There have been some technological advancements on what I was running in and what the generation before me was running in. If I slide down the ranking list, that’s the nature of sport.” One field of thought is that the new spikes will allow some suspect performances to be wiped from the record book with a preference for shoe-aided times over those potentially fuelled by performance-enhancing drugs. The implications could also be far wider than reducing elite times. Hoogkamer says the money that shoe companies input into training biomechanists will allow them to “help people with strokes to walk better, or find better prosthetics for people”. Others have pointed out that not only does the improved footwear help people with injury-prevention, but it also generates more interest in running and being active. “It’s beneficial for everyone,” says Hugo Chouissa, Brooks footwear merchandiser. Well, almost everyone. The record holders of yesteryear may well think differently.",1

 Personal insurance and French automobile manufacturer Following the departure of Romain Bardet who had spent his entire career at the team, Ag2r-Citroën's emphasis has shifted from targeting the general classification towards the classics and hunting for stages. While much will be expected from big-name signing Greg Van Avermaet, success may well come from in-house. Benoît Cosnefroy enjoyed a long spell in the mountains jersey at last year's Tour de France before taking podium places at La Flèche Wallonne, De Brabantse Pijl and Paris-Tours to underline what a talented and versatile rider the 25-year-old is. The arrival of Bob Jungels, a former winner at Liège-Bastogne-Liège and Kuurne-Bruxelles-Kuurne, will provide some much-needed firepower in the early spring classics and may even provide an option in the general classification. The capture of Ben O'Connor — who won a stage at last year's Giro d'Italia — on a one-year deal appears an astute acquisition. It was thin pickings for the French team in 2020: a solitary WorldTour win in the entire season when Nans Peters proved he was no one-hit wonder a year after winning from a breakaway at the Giro d'Italia. And what a follow up it was for the young Frenchman who, racing on home turf, dropped Ilnur Zakarin on the descent of the Peyresourde before soloing to the second win of his career during stage eight at the Tour. Ag2r-Citroën may have added 11 names to their roster, but it will take some time for many to get used to Bardet, 30, no longer riding for the team. The departure to DSM may well give Bardet a much-needed new lease of life, while his former employers will be hoping for a similar boost. Kazakhstan

 Alexandre Vinokourov 
 Kazakh consortium and Canadian biotechnology company Alexandre Vinokourov may end up rueing the loss of Miguel Ángel López, but one imagines the Kazakh will not have lost too much sleep during the close season given the remaining firepower he has at his disposal. One of the big concerns for Astana, possibly, is the age of the creaking squad, with a number of the big-name riders all edging towards the latter parts of their careers: Omar Fraile (30), the Izagirre brothers (Ion, 31 and Gorka, 33) and Luis León Sánchez (37) are all in their thirties, as is Jakob Fuglsang (35) who last year won his second monument at Il Lombardia. However, along with a number of youngsters that will bring some fresh blood into the squad, the 24-year-old Aleksandr Vlasov will be hoping to build on what turned into a frustrating season for the Russian. Impressive performances at La Route d'Occitanie and a victory at the Mont Ventoux Dénivelé Challenge, along with some good results at the Italian classics, were tempered by the disappointment of having to abandon the Giro d'Italia. Bounced back at the Vuelta a España where he finished second on the Angliru stage, though, underlining why many have tipped him to become the first Astana rider since Fabio Aru in 2015 to win a grand tour. In what turned out to be one of the most breathtaking Tours de France in living memory López, the rider that is nicknamed Superman in Colombia, left his rivals gasping for air on the vertiginous slopes of the col de la Loze. The 26-year-old may not have threatened the overall, but for one majestic afternoon he rode Primoz Roglic, Sepp Kuss and Tadej Pogacar off his wheel making all three look ordinary, which they are anything but. Though far from being the team's figurehead, the departure of López overshadows any of the incoming eight riders who are, broadly speaking, untried youngsters. ""They were six wonderful years, I grew up and learned a lot with them,"" said López following his transfer to Movistar. Bahrain

 Kingdom of Bahrain Despite having lost team principal Rod Ellingworth, who returned to Ineos Grenadiers after just one season at the Bahraini squad, the future may not be as grim as some have predicted for Bahrain Victorious in 2021. The arrival of Jack Haig should bolster Mikel Landa's grand tour ambitions, while the 27-year-old may be keen on taking a leadership role in the shorter one-week races. It is elsewhere, though, where the wins may come from for the intriguingly renamed Bahrain Victorious squad. Dylan Teuns, 28, has the power and climbing ability to cope on both the Belgian cobbles and Ardennes classics, while Heinrich Haussler (36) may also challenge in the spring classics. It is Fred Wright, though, that may be the team's darkest horse. Working below the radar, away from the spotlight placed on Ineos riders, the Londoner impressed as the grand tour debutant finished fourth during a stage of last year's Vuelta a España. Jan Tratnik's win at the Giro d'Italia came as a blessed relief for the team, it was a relief too for the Slovenian whose brother and girlfriend stood at the roadside near the finish line of stage 16 at San Daniele del Friuli. Tratnik rode a canny finale and dropped Ben O'Connor, who had earlier chased him down before the pair rode towards the finish together, on the last short and steep climb of the day to claim the biggest win of his career. Signed on a three-year contract from Mitchelton-Scott — renamed BikeExchange for 2021 — Haig, in theory, is a very smart signing. The Australian diesel will a key cog in the stage-race engine room and may even land a big one for himself if he is given the freedom to roam. Australia

 Shayne Bannan 
 Australian cycling retailer The headline for some may have been the transfer of Adam Yates who joined Ineos Grenadiers during the close season, but the Briton's departure is far from being the only change within the Australian team. Along with Adam Yates, Jack Haig (Bahrain Victorious), Daryl Impey (Israel Start-up Nation) and Edoardo Affini (Jumbo-Visma) also headed out of the exit door while the veteran  Michael Albasini retired. Coming in the other direction, Amund Grondahl Jansen arrived from Jumbo-Visma, Tanel Kangert comes in from EF Pro Cycling, Michael Matthew returns and the team signed 21-year old Italian Kevin Colleoni. And so, what to expect in 2021? With 11 of their 27-man squad at or above the age of 30, the make-up of the team is starting to look very familiar and, quite possibly, a little tired. The likes of Simon Yates and Esteban Chaves, who despite the Colombian's boyish smile is 31, need to deliver big one-day wins or launch a serious general classification challenge in the grand tours. On a more positive note, the 24-year-old Lucas Hamilton showed glimpses of promise last year, with a Tirreno-Adriatico stage win. Back-to-back stage wins at Tirreno-Adriatico from Hamilton and Simon Yates were the highlights of what had been a disappointing season. A few days later, however, Yates won the general classification ahead of fellow Briton Geraint Thomas, making the Mitchelton-Scott rider one of the favourites for the Giro d'Italia. Unfortunately the Tirreno-Adriatico title in September was as good as it got for Yates and his team-mates. Having spent four seasons at Sunweb, the return of Matthews should bring some much-needed steel in the punchy one-day classics, while the Australian can go stage hunting at the Tour. Hopefully can offer the team some belief after losing Adam Yates to Ineos Grenadiers over the winter.  Germany

 Manufacturers of kitchen appliances & bathroom products Just weeks out from the start of the season new signing Wilco Kelderman, a general classification rider who finished third at last year's Giro d'Italia, and a group of team-mates were involved in a crash during a training camp near Lake Garda in northern Italy. It was the worst possible start for Kelderman; the worst start to the new year for Bora-Hansgrohe. Just under two weeks after Kelderman was left concussed and having sustained a fractured vertebrae — while Rüdiger Selig and Andreas Schillinger were all taken to hospital — it was Peter Sagan's turn to give his team a fright after he crashed while on a training camp on Gran Canaria. Things, one feels, can only get better for the luckless squad. While much of the focus will be on an ageing Sagan, the squad has plenty of firepower upon which it can rely, including their tried and tested trio of German riders Pascal Ackermann, Emanuel Buchmann and Maximilian Schachmann. Able to challenge, respectively, in the pure sprints, the Ardennes-style climbs and the high mountains, this trident will ensure the team is challenging across all terrains once racing is under way. Things did not look good for Sagan after he had finally loosened his vice-like grip on the green jersey at the Tour de France. With sharpened quills cycling's obituary writers prepared themselves as he headed to his maiden Giro. In Italy the once imperious Sagan looked . . . normal. During stage 10, though, he launched an audacious attack from some distance out in the lashing rain to claim one of his greatest wins. Pure  . A runners-up place at Paris-Roubaix and fifth at Tour of Flanders in 2019 would suggest that Nils Politt may well be the heir apparent to Sagan who, despite his brilliant win at the Giro, is a fading force. Which may be why Bora-Hansgrohe handed the 26-year-old Politt a three-year contract. France

 Money-lending company Following their return to the top tier of cycling, much was expected from Cofidis in 2020 following their high-profile signings of Italian sprinter Elia Viviani and French general classification contender Guillaume Martin. And then? Well, not much unfortunately. It was, in summary, a poor season for the French team whose wait for a stage win at the Tour de France was extended to 13 years having again fired blanks on home turf. In the countdown to the new season, it was reported that Elia Viviani had undergone surgery having experienced heart palpitations while on a training ride. Despite the setback, he confirmed his race schedule would go ahead as planned. ""My programme remains the same,"" he said. ""I’m calm and also determined to have the season of redemption that I need."" It is not, however, all doom and gloom for Cofidis. Martin will be hoping to build on what was a promising season, while the squad has enough talent to pick off the odd win once the stage races get under way. May struggle in the one-day classics, although the addition of Luxembourg rider Jempy Drucker may go some way to help in that department. While Attilio Viviani and Anthony Perez may claim their stage wins at La Tropicale Amissa Bongo and the Tour du Haut Var were highlights of the season, it was Martin's performance during the opening week of the Tour that impressed most. Third on stage four at Orcières-Merlette behind Primoz Roglic and Tadej Pogacar will have given the Frenchman plenty to mull over during the winter, and plenty to build on throughout 2021. Although he has just three wins on his  , veteran German Simon Geschke brings with him a wealth of experience. Though unlikely to add any money into Cofidis' prize pot, the 34-year-old will be a reliable  for leader Martin and is a more-than-capable road captain. Belgium

 Producer of windows & laminate flooring manufacturers Despite having held the   for three days at the Tour de France before a jolly green Irishman won the final stage on the Champs-Élysées, some within the team may have considered 2020 a disappointment. Even including the rainbow jersey won in Imola and their Portuguese carrying the   on his young shoulders for 15 days at the Giro d'Italia. While losing their position as the world No 1-ranked team — a title the team held for two years straight before Jumbo-Visma toppled them — Deceuninck-Quick Step also failed to win a single monument. Though not unheard of, these races are the bread and butter of the Belgian team. Though packed with talent, will be fascinating to see how they cope with the likes of Mathieu van der Poel and Wout van Aert in the cobbled classics, the races where the Belgian team is expected to perform by both sponsors and its passionate fanbase in Flanders. In Julian Alaphilippe will be eyeing success in the Ardennes and stage two at the Tour, and praying Remco Evenepoel can return to action following his long-term lay-off and finally get his grand tour career under way at the Giro. Will be interesting to see how the team manage Joao Almeida who was, arguably, the breakthrough rider of 2020 after leading the Giro for two weeks. Going into the Giro few were familiar with Almeida. Three weeks later the 22-year-old was being talked of as a potential grand tour winner. Despite the successes of Evenepoel who won all four stage races he started, it was the way in which Almeida and his team-mates defended the   that impressed most. Honourable mention goes to young Briton James Knox who worked tirelessly for his team-mate's cause. His best days may well be behind him, but ​Mark Cavendish's return to Deceuninck-Quick Step is a fascinating move from  . Whether he wins races, or most likely does not, it will be interesting to see what role Cavendish plays for the team.  Germany

 Dutch multinational In terms of race wins — 16 at Continental and WorldTour level through nine different riders — 2020 was the best year the team had had since 2017 (18) which, given the truncated nature of the season, was impressive. It was the nature of those wins, though, that stood out most. Whether eyeing an early-season win at Paris-Nice, a stage at the Tour de France or a solo sortie in the Ardennes, the team's sporting directors had it covered. Technically and tactically the squad were practically faultless. Even at the Giro d'Italia where there was a slight wobble, 24-year-old Jai Hindley won the spectacular stage that traversed the Stelvio Pass before finishing second overall; his now former team-mate Wilco Kelderman third. The departure of Marc Hirschi in the new year may have cast a shadow over DSM's preparations for the season, but the arrival of Romain Bardet is a fascinating transfer. Whether or not the Frenchman is deployed as a general classification contender, a stage hunter in the big races or the hilly one-day classics remains to be seen, but one can only assume the brains behind one of the most exciting teams of the last year have a plan.  With impressive wins from Tiesj Benoot, Hindley, Hirschi, Soren Kragh Andersen it is a difficult one: take your pick. However, Kragh Andersen's first stage at the Tour was certainly the most entertaining. In another tactical masterclass from the team, Benoot attacked off the front before Hirschi went, followed by the Dane Kragh Andersen who soloed across the line to bring home the bacon with the biggest win of his career. Hirschi​'s departure from DSM on January 5 took almost everybody by surprise. Following his stellar breakthrough season in 2020 it was assumed the team would build around him. The young Swiss, though, had other plans and four days later joined UAE Team Emirates. Ouch. US

  Jonathan Vaughters 
  Education company and Japanese construction company Enjoyed their best season since 2014, won stages in all three grand tours — with six different riders — and  to produce a one-off kit, with ducks on. All-in-all, a successful season then. Following a tricky few years, Jonathan Vaughters' squad has quietly and efficiently become a well-rounded and balanced outfit, able to challenge for stages and the classics. While the departures of Daniel Martínez (Ineos Grenadiers), Michael Woods and Sep Vanmarcke (Israel Start-up Nation) and Simon Clarke (Qhubeka-Assos) will certainly weaken them, the core of the squad appears strong enough to challenge throughout the season. In theory, lost more firepower than they brought in during the close season, but Hugh Carthy should bring the team further joy throughout 2021, while it will be interesting to monitor the ongoing development of promising young American climber Neilson Powless. While Ruben Guerreiro and Sergio Higuita can help in the mountains, Alberto Bettiol and Michael Valgren will spearhead the spring classics campaign. Along with Italian climbs the Mortirolo Pass and Monte Zoncolan, the Alto de l'Angliru in Asturias in northern Spain is considered one of the toughest ascents in world cycling. And so when Carthy won stage 12 at the Vuelta a España on this mythical climb the entire world took notice. The manner in which the 193cm tall Prestonian dropped some of the best climbers in the race was as impressive as it was breathtaking. EF Education-Nippo will be hoping that new signing Valgren can rediscover his 2018 form. However, making his team debut at Étoile de Bessèges the Dane suffered a huge setback following a crash in which he sustained fractures to the second and third metacarpals in his left hand. France

 French national lottery Take away the wins from sprinter Arnaud Démare and Stefan Küng and Kevin Geniets' national titles and Groupama-FDJ were left with just three wins in 2020, the opening stage at Étoile de Bessèges for Alexys Brunel and a pair for young climber David Gaudu at the Vuelta a España. Given the team is essentially a state-sponsored vehicle to advertise the French national lottery — run by individuals that think and act as civil servants, according to French journalist François Thomazeau — it is unlikely Marc Madiot is under pressure to deliver better results in 2021, though most observers will be hoping he can. It is safe to say that last year's Tour de France was an unmitigated disaster after the team's main general classification hope Thibaut Pinot crashed on stage one, while his No 2 Gaudu was anonymous having arrived off the back of an illness. With a largely unchanged squad, Madiot will be hoping that Pinot can challenge in either the Tour, or if reports are to be believed, the Giro d'Italia while Démare will, surely, make his return to the Grande Boucle. Démare may also be targeting the spring classics, along with Swiss time-trial specialist Küng who managed top-10 finishes last year at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Ghent-Wevelgem and Driedaagse Brugge-De Panne. Having been omitted from the Tour squad, Démare went on to win four stages at the Giro along with the points jersey. It was his victory on stage six, though, that stood head and shoulders above the rest. On an uphill drag that favoured the likes of Michael Matthews or Peter Sagan, Démare went from some distance out to take the stage and underline why many argued he was the best all-round sprinter of 2020. Only time will tell if allowing the talented Frenchman Marc Sarreau to join Ag2r-Citroën was a mistake or not. However, having cut short his season following his involvement in the crash that did for fellow sprinter Fabio Jakobsen at last year's Tour of Poland, his condition is unknown. Great Britain

 Sir Dave Brailsford 
 Multinational chemicals company It was a peculiar year for the British team, but one which saw Ineos Grenadiers earn some new fans after adopting a new-look brand racing. Admittedly, their swashbuckling style was largely enforced on them after team leaders Egan Bernal and Geraint Thomas prematurely departed the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia respectively, but it was nonetheless a welcome approach from a team long associated with metronomic racing. Having strengthened with Laurens De Plus, Daniel Martínez, Richie Porte and Adam Yates, Ineos Grenadiers would appear more than prepared for the challenge laid down by Jumbo-Visma and UAE Team Emirates at last year's Tour de France. The addition of British neo-pro Tom Pidcock, meanwhile, should give the squad the option to liven things up in the early season one-day races, while another young Briton Ethan Hayter appears on course to make a name for himself in the classics. It will be interesting to see how the team management approach the new season: do they continue in the same vein as 2020, or revert to type? Whatever is decided, in Thomas, Bernal, Richard Carapaz and Geoghegan Hart — their four former grand tour winners — they have the firepower to contest the biggest stage races, and enough talent across to board to challenge in the Ardennes classics. Chris Froome may have left, but the team's conveyor belt of talent is showing no sign of coming to a halt. Having arrived at the Giro d'Italia as  for team-mate Geraint Thomas, Geoghegan Hart was installed as a 225-1 outsider to win his first grand tour when the Welshman crashed out just three days into the race. Two stage wins and a   — that he sealed on the final day — later and the Londoner joined the sport's immortals. It was one of the feelgood stories of not only the cycling season, but of the sporting year too. The capture of Pidcock is a massive coup for Ineos Grenadiers. Not only is he one of the most promising talents in the world right now, but also one of the most versatile and exciting riders of a generation. Targeting the Ardennes and hopes to makes his grand tour debut at the Vuelta a España. Belgium

 Belgian food retailer and engineering companies The newest kids on the WorldTour block, Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux, acquired their top-tier status having taken the licence from the now defunct CCC squad. They are also, on paper, one of the weakest. Despite having signed the vastly experienced Rein Taaramae (33), Jan Hirt (30), and Louis Meintjes (28), may struggle at making any sort of impact in the top level. However, will be hoping to challenge for stages and getting into breakaways during the Tour de France, and may even pick up the occasional win at the lower Continental level. Of the further additions — Jonas Koch, Baptiste Planckaert, Lorenzo Rota, Taco van der Hoorn, Riccardo Minali and Georg Zimmermann — it is the Dutchman Van der Hoorn that catches the eye most. The former Jumbo-Visma rider may have a short  with just the lesser known Schaal Sels one-day race on his list of wins, alongside the Primus Classic and a BinckBank Tour stage, but may be a source of victories for his new team. Taking just four wins in 2020, none of which were at WorldTour level, was not exactly inspiring stuff for the team. In fact, the biggest victory came from Xandro Meurisse who won a stage at the Vuelta a Murcia before he clinched the overall in the two-day race. Sadly, the Belgian all-rounder joined Alpecin-Fenix over the winter and so will not be repeating similar performances for Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux in 2021. Meintjes may have struggled since finishing eighth at the 2017 Tour, but the 28-year-old has an opportunity here to save his floundering career. Equally, having signed the South African climber on a one-year deal the team may have landed themselves an absolute steal. Israel

The capture of seven-time grand tour winner Chris Froome from Ineos Grenadiers that sparked a massive recruitment drive took the headlines, but the pressure will be on the 35-year-old who has not won a race since May 2018 to deliver the goods. The overall strengthening of the squad, however, should enable the team to make the required improvements. The arrivals of Sebastian Berwick, Patrick Bevin, Alessandro De Marchi, Carl Fredrik Hagen, Daryl Impey, Taj Jones, Sep Vanmarcke and Michael Woods will both offer support to Froome, while simultaneously add to the team's collective  A highly creditable eighth place at the 2019 Vuelta a España — between Wilco Kelderman and Marc Soler — highlights why Fredrik Hagen was wanted to help Froome in the mountains, while De Marchi ( ), Impey ( ), and Woods ( ) have all proved themselves at the highest level. Out of contract at the end of the season and expecting his first child, Alex Dowsett managed to get into the breakaway during stage eight at the Giro d'Italia. For some that may have been enough. Not Dowsett, not on this day. Having worked with team-mate Matthias Brändle, Dowsett escaped around 20km from the line before using his time trial skills to perfection and claim an emotional win for both rider and fans watching at home. He is the big-budget signing around which the team's Tour ambitions have been built, but can Froome buck the trend for youngsters winning and take home a record-equalling fifth  ? Whatever happens, following the Froome roadshow should be utterly engrossing. Holland

Five years later two monuments (Milan-Sanremo and Liège-Bastogne-Liège), a grand tour (Vuelta a España) and three stages at the Tour de France resulted in them becoming the No 1 ranked team in men's road cycling.

 Belgian national lottery and adhesives manufacturer Bolstered largely by Caleb Ewan's wins — the sprinter won two Tour de France stages, following two at the Tour Down Under and one apiece at the UAE Tour and the Tour de Wallonie before taking a magnificent seventh of the season at Scheldeprijs — only Matthew Holmes and Tim Wellens managed to take home any WorldTour wins in 2020. Whether or not it was fuelled by suffering their worst season in a decade, or not, an influx of young riders — all but one (Kamil Malecki, 25) are either 23 or under — gives the team a very new feel for 2021. It may also lead to them challenging for fewer races too, at least in the short-term. May need some of the older heads like Philippe Gilbert and John Degenkolb to step up during the spring classics, while Tim Wellens' form at Etoile de Bessèges, where he won a stage and the overall, would suggest the Belgian is in fine form in the countdown to the WorldTour. Although there were two stage wins at the Tour for Ewan along with two for Wellens at the Vuelta a España, it was an early-season victory from Holmes that stood out most. The Briton, competing in his first WorldTour race after joining from Madison-Genesis, did the improbable and ended Richie Porte's six-year reign on the Willunga Hill stage at the Tour Down Under. Holmes later impressed in breakaways at the Giro d'Italia. Having made wholesale changes, including bringing in five riders from their under-23 squad, the departure of Carl Fredrik Hagen to Israel Start-up Nation will likely cost them in the hillier stages. Appears, though, that Lotto-Soudal's plans are focused very much on the long-term. Spain

 Spanish mobile telephone company Given they lost Richard Carapaz, Mikel Landa and Nairo Quintana going into the year, and signed no fewer than 14 riders, last season was always going to be one of transition. Nobody, however, will have predicted that the oldest team in the WorldTour would have endured the worst year in their long and illustrious history since first forming as Reynolds in 1980. It is safe to say that for Movistar in 2021, things can only get better. While the once reliable Alejando Valverde, who at 40 is the oldest rider in the WorldTour, is starting to look his age, big things will be expected from Marc Soler. Enric Mas, meanwhile, will be hoping to build on his quietly impressive performances at last year's tours of France and Spain where he finished fifth, despite barely poking his nose into the wind. Big things, too, are expected from marquee signing Miguel Ángel López who arrives from Astana and will, presumably, form part of the team's two-pronged attack at the Tour de France alongside his new team-mate Mas. Although not widely heralded, the captures of Iván García Cortina and Gregor Mühlberger should give the squad an outlet in the spring classics, while also providing a couple of proven engines in the grand tours. Gonzalo Serrano arrives from Caja Rural-Seguros RGA while Abner González became the first Puerto Rican to ride in the WorldTour. It was an uncharacteristically poor season for Movistar who managed just two wins in the entire season, both coming from Soler. Having first won a stage at the Mallorca Challenge in February, the Spaniard landed a superb stage at the Vuelta a España after attacking on the descent off the final climb on stage two before soloing to victory. It came as a huge relief for the team, with the added bonus of the win being on their home roads. A year after a very public dispute at the Vuelta, ​Ángel López has joined the team he said was full of ""stupid people"". One imagines the pre-season training camp will have been interesting. Either way, Movistar have acquired a talented climber and proven stage winner. South Africa

 South African charity and Swiss cycling apparel Having lost their title sponsor late in 2020, Doug Ryder's squad was handed a reprieve from Swiss apparel brand Assos who already supplied the team with their kit. Though welcome, the deal came through too late to halt a mass exodus with the squad losing 15 riders to other teams while four retired. Coming in the other direction were 17 riders of varying experience from the under-23, Continental and WorldTour divisions. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the team, kept hold of world hour record holder Victor Campenaerts, while the veteran climber Domenico Pozzovivo, now 38, has one year left on his contract. Giacomo Nizzolo will be hoping to regain the form he had before crashing out of last year's Tour de France just days after winning the European road title in Plouay. May rue the departure of Ben O'Connor to Ag2r-Citroën, but will be hoping the experience of new signings like Simon Clarke and Sergio Henao can help guide their new-look squad in the right direction. While there were some impressive wins for Italian sprinter Nizzolo, it was O'Connor's stage victory at the Giro that towered above the rest. A day after losing out to Jan Tratnik, the Australian who was out of contract at the end of the season, bounced back in the best possible way to land the biggest win of his career. Possibly a big mistake in not re-signing him. He may not have claimed a single race since the 2017 Tour when he won on La Planche des Belles Filles, but Fabio Aru may just be able to rebuild his career with Qhubeka-Assos. The 30-year-old has one year in which to do so as he enters what many are calling the last-chance saloon.

 US bicycle manufacturer and Italian coffee brand It was a mixed season for the team whose main general classification rider Vincenzo Nibali looked his age (36) at the Giro d'Italia, while another, Bauke Mollema, crashed out of the Tour de France with a broken wrist. It was not all doom and gloom, however. Richie Porte finished third at the Tour — the best result of his career — and world champion Mads Pedersen managed to show off the rainbow stripes in Paris. The early-season win from Jasper Stuyven at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad was hugely impressive, while wins from Pedersen at the Tour of Poland, BinckBank Tour and Ghent-Wevelgem along with the return to the fold of Quinn Simmons — who was suspended after the 2019  junior world champion posted “divisive” and “incendiary” tweets — would suggest that it is the one-day classics where the squad's strengths may lie in 2021. Though not in the WorldTour, Matteo Moschetti twice got the better of Pascal Ackermann with wins at the Mallorca Challenge, leading to many saying the 24-year-old can challenge in the big sprints. Very quiet in the transfer market, signing just Amanuel Ghebreigzabhier from the WorldTour while three under-23 riders —  Jakob Egholm, Mattias Skjelmose Jensen, Antonio Tiberi — also joined the squad. Having book-ended his maiden Tour with two second place finishes, Pedersen did what few had predicted and got the better of Mathieu van der Poel and Wout van Aert at Ghent-Wevelgem. Benefiting from the pair's refusal to commit in the finale, the young Dane proved yet again he was both a supremely talented and canny rider as he won his first semi-classic after outsprinting Florian Sénéchal and Matteo Trentin to the line. Having finally made the podium at a grand tour at last year's Tour, the 36-year-old Richie Porte will ride for his former paymasters Ineos Grenadiers in 2021. The departure of the solid professional — though not a seasoned winner in the big races — may be a big loss in the grand tours. UAE

 José Antonio Fernández 
 Emirates The Emirati-owned squad with the Italian heart enjoyed its greatest season yet in terms of both number of wins and, perhaps more importantly, the quality of wins. Stages in all three grand tours, along with the biggest prize of them all — the fabled yellow jersey for winning the Tour de France — propelled the squad into whole new stratosphere. Along with Ineos Grenadiers and Jumbo-Visma, UAE Team Emirates are now expected to challenge for the biggest honours in world cycling. The arrival of Rafal Majka should give Tadej Pogacar more support when he needs it most — the young Slovenian cannot expect to defend his Tour title without having to do some of the heavy lifting in 2021 — while Matteo Trentin will bring some much-needed experience. The surprise signing of Marc Hirschi, meanwhile, will both take the pressure off Pogacar while also, on paper, assuring his new paymasters some big wins. Was a big surprise to see young Belgian sprinter Jasper Philipsen leave for Alpecin-Fenix, but armed with Fernando Gaviria and the evergreen Alexander Kristoff should have enough to challenge in the sprints and one-day classics. Another one to watch will be Brandon McNulty, 22, who finished 15th on his grand tour debut at last year's Giro d'Italia. Pogacar's performance in the penultimate day time trial of the Tour was one of the most astonishing days in the history of the world's biggest bike race. For Pogacar, his performance was career-defining; for his rival and compatriot Primoz Roglic heartbreaking. A day after winning on La Planche des Belles Filles, Pogacar became the second youngest winner in the Tour's history dating back to 1903. Put simply: it was unbelievable. Hirschi's arrival from Sunweb was not only the biggest transfer of UAE Team Emirates' close season, but of the entire WorldTour also. Indeed, it was reported by  that his new employers multiplied his salary by 14 — from around €70,000 to €1 million. But can he deliver? Probably.",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2020/11/18/really-like-line-against-jonah-lomu-did/,sport,"By far the most compelling difference between Ireland and New Zealand in 1995 was Jonah – he was exceptional that day and he just got better,  It was not the case that we knew about him. This was 1995, pre-video analysis, and in Ireland we relied on whatever southern hemisphere rugby the BBC broadcast – which was scant. Around that time you might have got some highlights from the Hong Kong Sevens or something. Before the World Cup, Lomu had not really broken into the All Blacks team but had made his mark at schoolboy and Sevens level. So, in terms of exposure in the media – there was none. In terms of video analysis in my day and the days of early professionalism – none of that was there in 1995. So we didn’t really know anything about him! I would have gone into the game totally blindsided if it hadn’t been for a journalist. We were staying in the Sunnyside Park hotel in Johannesburg and to get to the team room you had to walk through a terrace that you could access from outside the hotel. I walked through doors of the hotel to be accosted by this journalist – I can’t remember who – two days before the game. He asked to have a quick chat and, long before the days where the media were segregated from the players, I said no problem. We started chatting and more or less off the bat he says: ‘So you’re up against Jonah Lomu in a few days’ time – what are your thoughts?’ And I really didn’t have any! I said something along the lines of: ‘You know, he’s an All Black wing and all All Black wings I’ve come across have been great so I have no doubt that he’s going to provide stern opposition.’ Straightaway the journalist realised that I had no idea who Jonah was or, at least, his potential. So he says three things to me and with each phrase my pallor changed. It started with him telling me that he’s 6ft 4ins and I thought, ‘Ok, he’s tall, so?’. Then he said he does the 100 metres in 10.5 seconds and I thought, ‘Ok, tall, lanky, quick – I’ve played against guys like Nigel Walker, for example, who was an Olympic sprinter and if you got your angles right you could deal with them’.  And then he dropped the clanger. ‘He’s 19 stone,’ he said. I must have gone pale. I had no idea how to react to this so I just said, ‘the bigger they are, the harder they fall’. And, of course, he never fell. My first contact with him came when we fly-hacked the ball away from our 22 and it went straight into Jonah’s hands. I pushed up, he ran at me and I thought, ‘here is a big lad running at me, I know what he’s going to do – he’s going to run over the top of me.’ So I went in to make the tackle and tried to anticipate his weight coming in and fall back with him and hopefully drag him down that way. But he had other plans. He stepped me and, before I knew it, I was off balance on the ground and he was scoring under the posts. I didn’t have too many one-on-ones with him, however, as they kept using him in the midfield. Thankfully my reputation wasn’t hugely affected by his prowess! He was so much more powerful. His quads were twice the size of mine – Jesus. It was like getting into a ring with a super-heavyweight.  But I didn’t feel inadequate afterwards, I was more in awe. We had just witnessed a phenomenal, once-in-a-lifetime athlete. A few years later, Ireland played a World XV in the ‘Peace International’ just after the Good Friday agreement. I was having a beer after the match with Eric Rush, the New Zealand Sevens legend, and he asked me if I had sent a fax to Jonah before that 1995 match.  I said, ‘what do you mean?’ And he said that Jonah received a fax from me, from our hotel, saying that I was going to do all sorts of things to him and make a fool of him on the pitch. And, for the second time with regard to Jonah Lomu, the blood drained from my face. Obviously I hadn’t and implored Eric to go back to New Zealand and talk to anyone remotely interested in rugby – so, the whole population – and please impress upon them that I did not do any such thing. Jonah did find out that it wasn’t me, eventually. He said he thought it was one of my friends who did it as a prank. Well, they wouldn’t be much of a friend… Maybe it was someone from the NZRFU? From their point of view maybe he was too relaxed and maybe they were trying to really get him going, to make him more aggressive. But, God, they really didn’t need to do that. I think the fact that   is testament to what it’s like to face him.  Without wishing to sound dismissive about the preparation, the tournament was very much one of the first occasions he had burst onto the scene. He had played some Tri-Nations stuff before the World Cup and then played excellently against Ireland and Scotland, but this was 1995 – it was amateur. Your ability to be able to study these things or embrace the level that the game is at now in preparing to face opposition teams was very different. We were almost victims of our own success the week before when we beat Australia in the quarter-final. It was a massive victory against the world champions; a lot of the 1995 squad had played in the 1991 final that Australia won and it had hurt them. There was a lot of animosity between the two teams. David Campese was a major character and ego in their team, and very vocal with it.  So, with that win, and such a good win, we almost felt like we’d done it. We felt like we could almost walk home with our heads held high. There was a lot of friction between the RFU and the England team – the RFU ‘old farts’ stuff hadn’t quite gone away. So that was still going on. But the RFU was wealthy and, almost as an olive branch to us, they whisked us up to Sun City, almost as an unplanned celebration. But that impacted our preparation for New Zealand. The leadership group were uncertain about going. But they felt it might be good to get a break from the monotony of what was going on as we’d been in South Africa for quite a few weeks by that point. We were probably up there too long and it was too late by the time we came back down – figuratively as well as geographically… So, how did we prepare for it? An element of overconfidence. We’d won a Grand Slam and we’d just beaten the world champions. We had a couple of iffy group games which weren’t fantastic but we beat an Argentina pack that was recognised as a real force, so we headed into the game with a lot of confidence. We felt as if we had the upper-hand up front. I wasn’t in the selection meeting but from what I understand it was quick and they kept the same team. In terms of my preparation, there’s not a lot you can physically do in a few days leading up to a game. I couldn’t pile on a few more stone; I couldn’t suddenly learn to be a better defender, which wasn’t the best part of my game anyway, so that wasn’t going to change; and there wasn’t really an element of changing the game plan either to think about specifically how we’d deal with Jonah. It was 25 years ago so I will apologise now to Jack, Les, Will and John Elliott, and anyone else in the squad who might have had a conversation throughout the week, but I don’t recall conversations about Jonah ever happening. I recall a conversation asking if I felt OK about it and, well, what was I supposed to say? I was feeling good and I wanted to play in a semi-final of the World Cup. I had to go in with utmost confidence and think that because he’s a big man, if I get some space then I should take advantage of being the smaller man with a bit more manoeuvrability. Unfortunately, I never really got that. Collectively and as a team we had been shocked by him, not just (Mike) Catty and me. It was guys up front; some of our bigger, better defenders in the pack that were getting bumped by him, too. Such strength added to such speed and agility. But I didn’t really dwell on it – after, we did the Pizza Hut advert, for those who remember. In the aftermath, my focus wasn’t on Jonah. For me, my process had to be taking ownership of the fact that I had had this… not humiliation, but I’d been made to look and feel insignificant and I was totally ‘out-physicalled’. It was about to become my profession, and if I wanted to continue playing at the top of the game I had to go through a personal journey of my own, so the focus couldn’t be on Jonah, it had to be on how I moved forward and handled – to a certain extent – the crisis that I was facing at that time. My confidence took a big hit and I had to turn that around. There was absolutely a lot of soul-searching. The team talk preparing to play against him was really simple: absolutely do everything we can to give him no time and space. I’ve been in Canterbury and Crusader teams where we have done it really well. So we would always prepare to get up and shut him down before he got moving. We knew if we gave him time and space, that power… We had games against Jonah where our plan worked, and we had games against him where it didn’t matter what plan we had, he could just steamroll us. Him and Joeli Vidiri at Lancaster Park against Counties Manukau for a home semi-final, they put 17 points on us in about five minutes. They absolutely dominated the game, dominated the collisions and we couldn’t stop them. Trying to defend him on the blindside as a flanker? We just tried to make sure that we had a steady scrum and put their set piece under pressure. Rather than having to deal with him, try and put their scrum and half-back under pressure so they get s--- ball and they can’t attack from it. Try not to give him the ball on the front foot because if we did that it was tough. But playing with him was so good. I always felt more likely to win with him on my team – he was that much of a presence. And he was always well respected as a man of character – he was a great guy. He always gave a lot to his team and he was a great team-mate.",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2020/07/27/just-kept-going-graham-goochs-333-remembered-players-lords/,sport,"As a teenage cricket nut – and Essex fan – July 27, 1990 was a huge day for me. My first proper visit to Lord’s for a big-time Test match. And what a day it turned out to be, as my idol Graham Gooch forged on from his overnight 194 not out to reach 333, still the highest Test score ever made on the ground. Thirty years on, I spoke to three of the England players in that team – Gooch himself, David Gower and Angus Fraser – while Vijay Lokapally interviewed five members of the India side.  We had had a shocker in the Ashes the previous summer, when the ball had a ropelike seam. In 1990, it was the opposite: smaller seam, flatter pitches, millions of runs all around the country. But Mohammad Azharuddin still put us in!  It can be difficult when you win the toss at Lord’s. If the overhead conditions are heavy, the ball can move around a lot. It was a bit like that in this case. The wicket is also at its slowest on the first day, so you just try to play solidly and get through to lunch with one or two down.  We got Mike Atherton cheaply. I had come first-change and was getting late swing. I should have had Gooch early but he was dropped by wicketkeeper Kiran More on just 36. He nicked even as he was trying to leave the ball. If you give a chance to batsmen like Sunil Gavaskar, Virat Kohli, Steve Waugh, you only suffer. Gooch comes in that category. It was the costliest missed catch ever. I never played another Test.  I don’t know how I spilled it. Ten times out of ten I would have taken the catch. But it was the first hour and the ball deviated slightly and it just slipped away. Lucky git! Meanwhile I was given out caught at silly point when I didn’t touch it! Then I sat and watched Wimbledon for the next two days, only getting up six times to applaud Graham’s landmarks. Not that he celebrated them much. He was never going to wear himself out by raising his bat too vigorously. But seriously, once he had got past that chance, there is this thing about the big run-scorers: they just keep going. It is a tribute to fitness, concentration, determination. That’s what you call leading from the front.  Gooch knew how to bat on that pitch. The Lord’s slope threw a challenge and we could not cope with his tactics. He just kept flicking and on-driving us and by the time we realised it was too late. He was comfortably picking the runs and in no time he had his 200. I've never seen a batsmen play so many pulls in an innings. Probably we pitched it too short. Plus, none of us could bowl bouncers. Gooch was simply too good in that entire series.  Between 1987 and 1989, my game was not at its best. Terry Alderman exposed that in the 1989 Ashes. So I consulted Geoff Boycott, my opening partner from ten years earlier. I had good memories of when we played together, and I went back to that style in terms of set-up. And then with the captaincy coming back to me after that Ashes series defeat, everything just clicked. It was a double whammy. Those were the most productive years of my career, at an age when most people are probably past their best. [Gooch had turned 37 that same week.]  If you take away the chance he earned, it was an unblemished performance. Gooch has always been one of my favourite batsmen. He never called me by my name. “Master” he would call me. [Gooch has no memory of this, saying “I thought I always called him ‘Azhar’.”] He was smashing our bowlers around but you couldn’t take your eyes off his masterly show even though he was hurting us. There are times when you admire your opponent. Gooch was one such batsman. He played the on-drive to perfection. His sweep shot was always lethal. Our bowlers discovered the hard way in that Test. It was Gooch versus us really.  Once they stuck us in, they never looked like getting wickets, so we were just putting our feet up and enjoying the Lord’s hospitality. Allan Lamb and Robin Smith made hundreds too. You’ve got friends inviting you to one of the boxes, and you’re free as a player to go in and out, catch up with a few people in the corporate box, have lunch with your family in one of the suites. It was a relaxed environment. You went and did that knowing you wouldn’t be needed for some time.  People always mention about the BBC going off air on the second day to show racing [the 4.05pm from Ascot], just as I was about to get to 300. I was a bit nervous, so I probably slowed down then. But then, when I made it past, I was looking to tee off, make some quick runs ahead of the declaration. As it was, I was running out of petrol. After I was out [bowled through the gate by Prabhakar], Mickey [Stewart, the team manager] gave me a mild bollocking. He told me “What did you get out for? You should have got the record!” [The highest Test score was then Sir Garry Sobers’s 365, one ahead of Len Hutton’s still extant England record of 364.]  We made 650-odd but it wasn’t easy when we came to bowl. Azharuddin played one of the best innings I’ve seen – a stunning hundred off 80-odd balls. He was the second-best player I ever bowled at after Brian Lara. If you put it on off stump, he would hit you through midwicket. Then, if you bowled three inches wider, he’d slap you through backward point.  I was feeling good right from the first ball. After the [1989] tour to Pakistan, I had changed my grip and decided to bat more aggressively. You can say it was a once-in-a-lifetime knock for me. I was under pressure for having put England in. So, I had to make amends and prove a point. I actually found Fraser easy to handle because he made you play every ball. I like bowlers who make you play every ball. You had to watch out, though, because he was so accurate. He bowled a splendid line, close to the wicket, slight movement. He troubled the batsmen right through the series. I think he was the difference.  Since you ask, yes, I did nip in with a wicket [Sanjay Manjrekar, caught behind for 18.] I hope the poor guy didn’t take it too hard! But the attack was built around Gus. He liked to give it the old teapot, moaning away, but he was at his peak around that time. I thought I had caught Kapil off him at second slip, straight in. Unfortunately, there were no replays in those days. You had to wait for the umpire’s decision, and when Nigel Plews asked Dickie Bird – who was at square-leg – Dickie said “I can’t help you, Nigel”. Then Kapil hit Eddie Hemmings for four sixes in four balls, all into the building site at the Nursery End, to save the follow-on. It was all the more frustrating because, as soon as we got Kapil off strike, Gus finished the innings with the next ball.  Honestly, had it been five wickets in hand I wouldn’t have tried. We were the last pair and I had no choice but to hit. The follow-on was staring at us. The first two sixes I did plan, but the third and fourth happened because of the flow. And I could do that because I thought I was in a good nick. I kept telling Hiru [legspinner Narendra Hirwani] “Let us do it in singles”, only to mislead the bowlers! I just waited, and grabbed the chance when it became desperate.  I was not a happy bunny. I went back out to the wicket with impetus, spitting feathers. When you have a sniff of a chance, you have to drive it home. I was brought up with Mike Brearley and Keith Fletcher. In county cricket, you can’t get points sitting in the pavilion.  Gooch was not the batsman who would get bogged down. He loved to stay positive. He had got a hundred against us on a seaming pitch in 1986 [114 at Lord’s]. It was as good as any. Gooch was the best opener I have played against. Few could read the conditions like he did. Mentally tough, sound temperament, brilliant batting skills with his upright stance. He started that trend of holding the bat high. Never heard him speak when he was at the crease. He would just bat and bat and bat. A good man.  I was reminded of his hundred in the 1987 World Cup [semi-final] when he swept us out of the tournament. He was tough to bowl to when in such nick. To me, the 123 [which made Gooch the highest individual run-scorer in a single Test – a record which still stands] is the bigger achievement. So many people would have settled for having made a triple-century in the first innings, and not worried about the second. But by that stage of his career, Graham had worked out what he needed to do to make runs in big quantities, each and every day. And if he forgot for a moment, being captain reminded him. Far from being a burden, it spurred him on to greater things. This whole Test was a testimony to the ultimate professional, then at the top of his game.  I certainly never looked at the captaincy as a burden. I looked at it as an honour – the thing you remember most about your career. No individual performance can compare with being asked to lead your country. You’re not just making the decisions; you’re at the top of the pyramid of your whole sport. It’s up to you to show the way, because everyone looks to you for an example.  When they batted again, I remember that I got Sachin Tendulkar [then 17 years old and playing the eighth of his 200 Tests]. Some batsmen are unrecognisable between the start of their career and the finish. But Tendulkar has exactly the same beginning and end: strong off the legs, back-foot drives, cuts and stuff. If he has tinkered with his technique, it’s not noticeable on the eye.  After all that effort, it was satisfying that we finished it off by bowling them out. Hemmings chipped in with a couple of wickets. He was a bloody good bowler, as I always realised when I played against Nottinghamshire. Put real fizz on the ball, good loop, a lot of revs. A professional stroppy bugger too – although if you got him away from the environment, you realised it wasn’t all real. His stroppiness was part of an act, the same sort of act as my laidbackness. I guess we were both RADA trained!  I always playfully rib Gooch over the fact that it’s known as his match but I won the game by taking eight wickets. No-one remembers that. The batsmen go out there and fill their boots on a flat one, but it’s only seen as being a great match because we won. Still, that’s just me being a big-headed twat. In fact, Gooch finished it all off with a run-out from mid-off.  There’s a photo of the middle stump out of the ground. Direct hit. It was their third seamer [Sharma]. He would have thought “That fella’s not going to run me out. He’s an old man!”  ",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2021/03/31/record-premiership-cards-tally-proves-discipline-crackdown-has/,sport,"The referees know it, the coaches know it, and the players know it – 19 yellow cards in one round of the Gallagher Premiership, as happened last weekend, is far from ideal. Whereas in the previous round of fixtures the league happily tied the record for most tries scored in one weekend, the latest round plumbed new depths of indiscipline; it was the worst in Premiership history, with the most yellow cards ever in a single weekend – and three reds too. The Premiership has been rollicking along the bottom of the barrel this season, averaging eight cards per weekend. That is, by some stretch, the worst ever. On average, one player has been sent off in every round of the 2020-21 season – far beyond anything seen before – and seven players have seen yellow. Since 2015, the average number of yellow cards per round has been around four. The leap to seven is drastic; far above the average of the past five years and above all other seasons except 2013/14, when it was equalled. This continues a trend also seen in the international game: the 20 yellow cards handed out in the Six Nations was the most since 2000, and the five red cards was a record. The man responsible   last weekend is Christophe Ridley. The Premiership and international referee admits the indiscipline nadir is a ""teething period"", but is not concerned about the traditionalist fears of it inhibiting rugby's strength as a sport. ""I have seen some of the most entertaining rugby I've seen for many years over the past eight weeks,"" Ridley, 27, tells    . ""The Six Nations was fantastic and, although there were cards in the Premiership, we were looking at one-point, two-point games. ""I don't think [the cards are] killing the game – and I don't think it's a case of patience. For the 'traditionalist' who's watching rugby just to enjoy the game, now is the time to enjoy rugby more than ever."" The spike in cards this season requires some qualitative sifting, too. ""In my game last weekend, there were five yellow cards and three of them were not for foul play,"" Ridley adds. ""Two were for deliberate knock-ons and another was for a maul collapse near the goal-line; only two were for high tackles. So, although there were lots of cards at the weekend, many would still have existed three years ago. Saying that these cards have come as a result of changes that have happened in the game... I'm not sure that's quite accurate. ""It's not a case of referees being card-happy, but there is a clear separation between yellow cards for technical offences - which haven't changed - and yellow cards for foul play for which we have this new head-contact process."" It is a framework that was developed by the players for the players, with input from coaches and referees. This is being driven by the present crop, but the ramifications it could have on future generations should not be understated. ""This is not just about now and the games this weekend,"" Ridley adds. ""This is about players' futures above and beyond their careers. And it's not just about them; it's about the kid in 20 years' time making the decision as to whether he wants to pick up a rugby ball. ""We want to continue promoting a game that is not only protecting players now but is also seen as being a safe game for children in the future. ""Head-injury prevention is a number-one priority but there is absolutely still the opportunity for referees to say 'that's unavoidable, let's play on'. Referees will not lose the feel of the game. ""We still need to be able to have a good sense of whether there is any fault within the collision by either player. It's not just a case of saying 'there is a collision so there must be fault by somebody'."" Currently, the cards are being justified as a necessary evil to ensure rugby’s long-term sustainability. In terms of the present, however, a new disciplinary low is an inescapable fact that might require some addressing. One method for that, Ridley believes, is maintaining the two-way dialogue between clubs and officials. ""It's not cat and mouse,"" he says. ""We're not just showing up on game day; it's not 'us versus them'. We have relationships with these clubs, we talk to the coaches, players. They learn from us, we learn from them. ""We referee training sessions, we look at clips with the coaches, sometimes players ask about aspects of their game to paint better pictures."" One of  . Only Sale have conceded more yellow cards than the Tigers this season, and director of rugby Steve Borthwick believes the balance will only be recalibrated through hard work. ""Every team will be training [as 13 or 14 men],"" he says. ""What we need to do is lower the height. You quite rightly can’t have head contact so we need to play lower. ""When someone has been playing at the top level for a decade and has learnt the game at a certain height, trying to change that in a few days, weeks or months is a challenge. But we’re trying."" There is a sense, then, that the genie is out of the bottle. There will be no reversion, it is a case of conform or be outperformed. When judging individual decisions in the middle of a white-hot encounter, referees will not be unconsciously swayed by the rising tally. This is here to stay. ""It's not a case of patting ourselves on the back, saying how good we are,” Ridley adds. ""But it's not a case of grilling ourselves, either. It's about getting better and objectively going through each decision, not saying 'there are too many cards, what can we do?' We can't do that.""",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/snooker/2021/03/25/jimmy-white-give-stephen-hendry-head-start-10g-cocaine-four/,sport,"For Jimmy White, a renewal of rivalries with Stephen Hendry is enough to unleash a flood of memories - but few of them are happy ones.  Both men might now be in their fifties and well past their prime -   - but their reunion in the first round of qualifying for the Betfred World Championship in April promises to be one of snooker's red-letter occasions.  For White, however, the draw was bittersweet. In four World Championship finals between 1990 and 1994, White was beaten by Hendry: all left scars, although the deepest wounds were inflicted in 1992, when he lost despite being 14-8 ahead, and then 18-17 two years later.  While Hendry clocked up a record seven titles in total, White never did win a world final, although he was crowned the 'People's Champion', with public sympathy cranking up after each apparently impossible defeat.  White's free-spirited playing style was an endearing contrast to  , but the fact he was just as much a 'Whirlwind' in his private life ultimately proved decisive in denying him a title.  In his own autobiography White, now 58, claimed “I am lucky to be alive…I know drugs probably cost me 10 world titles”.  Speaking after the draw against Hendry, he said: “I have beaten Stephen in the World Championship a couple of times, but unfortunately they aren’t the ones everyone talks about.  “I lost the four finals to him…but in those [early 1990s] days I was giving him a head start of about 10 grams of cocaine and four bottles of Jack Daniels. “I came very close in winning two of the finals against him. In 1992 I was 14-8 up and getting my winning speech ready, but lost the next 10 frames.  “And then in 1994 I twitched a black in the decider at 17-17. But it is what it is, and I might not have been here if I had won the World Championship the way I was.”  White and Hendry's rivalry was always a friendly one - the Scot had practised with White, six years his senior, when he was just 13, and left an indelible impression even then. “I knew he was something special straight away and he became one of the greatest players the game has seen,” White added. “I played the majority of my best years against legends, two of the best ever in Steve Davis and Stephen. Steve was a bit more conservative at the table.   “And then there was this fantastic potter Stephen that came along and I had to compete against both. We have had so many battles not only at the World Championship but throughout our careers. And to draw each other at this stage of our careers is very bizarre.”  Either player would need to win four matches to get back to the Crucible. Hendry’s last appearance was in 2012, while White has not got to Sheffield since 2006, but the Londoner’s head is still spinning that fate has taken a hand, and given him a chance of some revenge so late in his career.  “I didn’t even see the draw announced on TV this week, or see it in any email,”  he said. “I had just finished practising, turned my phone on and I saw that I had two missed calls from Stephen.  “That on its own wasn’t too strange because we had been practising together recently. But I started thinking he wouldn’t call me twice so quickly like that to arrange a session.  “So I started to suspect what might have happened. I called him back, he said ‘Can you believe that’, and then I knew.  “It is absolutely bizarre, something from the snooker gods for sure. It is one that a lot of people might enjoy and look forward to.  “My closing line to him was that we wouldn’t be having a practice together before that match. But for me, I have found a bit of form and whoever I played, that is what I would be taking into it.  “I know that I will be playing him Tuesday week, and it is all about being ready for that. I haven’t stopped practising for about two or three years now. I'm much more disciplined than I used to be.” ",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/boxing/2021/03/31/12-pints-day-fighting-fit-two-weeks-inside-tyson-fury-training/,sport,"A fortnight ago, the sporting world stopped to hear the short, simple words it has long been waiting for: It’s on. But for Tyson Fury the announcement   with Anthony Joshua meant something different. It was time to get to work. Pictures emerged on Tuesday night of the Gypsy King looking lean, strong and fight-ready - just weeks after his claim he was ""drinking 12 pints a day"". It points to a fighter stepping up through the gears and demonstrates the impact of his early training regime. There are still three months until the fight, and there is yet to be white smoke on a venue, but time waits for no man and Fury has clearly not been sitting idle. Ben Davison, Fury’s former trainer   and helped him lose 10st in his comeback to be two-time heavyweight champion, talks us through life in a Tyson Fury training camp. Fury’s volatile weight has long been a point of fascination to outsiders. But, says Davison, it is not an issue in the rigours of the camp. ""There’s no need to monitor Tyson’s weight,"" he explains to  . ""He likes to jump on the scales himself in the morning. I’m sure he’ll have his nutritionist George Lockhart in, who cooks all his meals and keeps him on point with his diet. He’ll be taking care of all that."" Davison says Fury's regimen will include two sessions a day and encompass sparring, bag work, technical moves, footwork, strength and conditioning and running. ""He has his regular strength and conditioning, sparring - everything just gets tightened up,"" he says. ""Screws get tightened for preparation. He’s training all the time, twice a day, but in camp every detail is looked over. But Fury’s weight for fight week, and on fight night will be determined by the game plan."" Four months is a long time to sustain the punishing physical and mental regime of a training camp. ""Tyson's mood can change throughout the day, or weekly,” Davison says. ""I always found when he had a fight coming up, not necessarily the tick over jobs, but a genuine fight coming up that he wanted to perform in when he feels a little bit of pressure on his shoulders, it balances him. ""It’s almost like that’s where he finds his warrior spirit home. It is when he is most himself, the most complete, the most comfortable. The best version of Tyson is when there’s pressure. Physically, mentally, emotionally he finds a home in camp."" Fury will be watching Joshua fights, particularly his last few contests, looking for the footwork and feints that his rival uses, but also other fighters such as Roy Jones Jr, Floyd Mayweather, Muhammad Ali for inspiration. ""We were constantly watching boxing in the fight camp home. There was always boxing on and going over a fight. We’re all boxing fans as well as students of the sport,"" says Davison. Part of Fury’s ritual during camp is to attend church services at the weekends. ""[He] goes to church on the weekends. He likes to get up and go to Starbucks in the morning. He also likes having his brothers Shane and Hughie around."" Fury famously said   fight in Las Vegas in February 2020 that he was masturbating seven times a day to 'keep testosterone pumping' - but it may have just been headline clickbait, or his penchant for teasing reporters. ""I don't know, I don't check how often he masturbates. I don't keep a checklist on that,"" said Davison. Fury's brothers play a major part in camp. They are there from start to finish. His father John Fury, an outspoken character and former professional heavyweight boxer, is vastly knowledgeable and has an input in strategy and game plan. ""Hughie is a young but mature character. Passionate. I know he finds it hard watching Tyson fight and is very emotionally involved, as you can imagine,"" explains Davison, while brother Shane can play 'bad cop' in camp. ""Shane is a funny character, but a big character and a big guy. Both of them will tell Tyson what they think and I think that’s great to have. If he does something they disagree with, they’ll have that discussion with him. Let’s say another member of the team may not feel comfortable to put him in his place and may not express their feelings,"" revealed Davison. ""But he will know that the family thinks and I think that's important when you've got big fights coming up. It's important you're kept on the straight and narrow. You need someone giving you some home truths. All those adds to having a good performance. ""But when it gets to fight time - Tyson, like Josh Taylor, Billy Joe Saunders, who I also work with - the bottom line is that they would give up their purse to know for sure they’re going to win the fight. It's what sets the best boxers apart."" Fury normally has a visit from his wife, Paris, on the Thursday of fight week, if they have been separated for a long period. Paris is expecting their sixth child. It is hard to pin down exactly where Fury will base himself - and for how long - with no venue yet confirmed. Saudi Arabia   with Joshua. ""The thing about Tyson is he’s very unpredictable,"" Davison says. ""Tyson’s unpredictable in his training, he’s unpredictable in his lifestyle. He might want to go to Saudi [if fight is confirmed there] eight weeks before or he could decide to only go a few days before. He’s just so unpredictable. I wouldn’t be surprised if he set up his training camp at home and trained from home and then flew over there maybe the week of the fight or two weeks before.""  ",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/03/31/telegraph-players-year-bruno-fernandes-best-midfielder-england/,sport,"It is remarkable to think that Manchester United played down reports that they were planning to sign Bruno Fernandes in the summer of 2019 and even appeared to walk away from the deal because of the constant chatter around it. Now the talk is all about the 26-year-old midfielder and has been since he eventually did arrive at Old Trafford at the end of the winter window. If United had concerns as to whether he could step up from the Portuguese Primeira League to the Premier League then they may now harbour worries of another kind: can they keep pace with his ambition? For a club of the scale of United to be fretting about that over any one player shows how far they still have to go if they are to challenge again for major honours. But there is no doubt that Fernandes has done more than  He can lay claim to being the best ever January signing in the Premier League — although he does face stiff competition from Luis Suarez when he signed for Liverpool from Ajax. But Fernandes is in that debate. It is clear that Fernandes operates at the highest standards. The Portugal international demands it of himself and of his team-mates and neither does he hide his frustration when things go wrong. He is willing to speak his mind and criticise team-mates and losing three semi-finals last season — and another so far during this campaign — hit him hard. He wants to win trophies. In his first training session at United, he impressed with his demands for the ball and beyond his undoubted ability there is an extraordinary level of self-belief. The transformation he has brought about in United’s fortunes is not up for debate even if there have been valid suggestions that in the   — as Manchester City showed in the League Cup semi-final. Fernandes’ numbers alone are astonishing. Since his Premier League debut for United in February 2020 only Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski — both world-class forwards — have been involved in more goals in Europe’s big-five leagues than Fernandes (35 goals and 21 assists). In the Premier League alone he has an astonishing 24 goals from just 43 appearances. In 67 games overall he has 56 goal involvements. But that is not the end of the story for Fernandes who is not just United’s most creative player but is also the one who ‘sets the pressure’ in pushing the team up the pitch.   that also shows his fitness and stamina, a desire to lead the team and mental strength while being the player most likely to make a penetrating forward pass. The problem for United, at present, is to match him. Winning the Europa League and qualifying again for the Champions League would be a start. Falling short again in terms of trophies may be more problematic. Either way, Fernandes also deserves more players around him of his exacting standards and it is a challenge for United to provide them. It is no coincidence that he looks better with Paul Pogba in the midfield. As good as he is he cannot do it on his own.",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/03/31/project-2000-pedri-barcelonas-new-iniesta-may-yet-convince/,sport,"At the end of Paris Saint-Germain’s victory over Barcelona a few weeks ago, Kylian Mbappe made a beeline for Pedri Gonzalez. Mbappe handed his shirt to the teenager, who embraced the French striker, before there was an awkward pause between the two players. Pedri, you see, had not realised that Mbappe wanted his shirt in return. He hurriedly unzipped his jacket, peeling off the layers, before finally completing the swap. It was just a brief moment, but it said so much about the speed of Pedri’s rise this season that he was still a little taken aback by the fact   might even want his shirt at all. Even those who knew all about Pedri’s talent would not have expected him to shine so brightly, so early in his Barcelona career. At the age of just 18, he has already emerged as one of the most influential figures at one of the world’s biggest clubs, playing in every game this calendar year and, in the last week, making his first two appearances for the Spain senior team. Pedri, with his boyish face and almost impossibly slight frame, certainly does not look like an elite athlete. But like so many of the Spanish midfielders who have come before him, he plays with a touch and vision that sets him apart. The comparisons   have been relentless and they seem to be more accurate with each passing game, despite Pedri’s own insistence that he ""has to be Pedri"" rather than the new Iniesta. It took only a month of competitive football at Barcelona for Pedri to be described as ""the signing of the decade"" by  , the Spanish sports paper. Plucked from Las Palmas in the second tier, for a reported initial fee of just €5 million (£4.3m), Pedri was originally seen as one for Barcelona’s future. Already he has become their present, and his performances have been so impressive that some in Spain have speculated that his emergence  . As well as the technical ability — the understanding of space, the wonderful simplicity with which he passes the ball — there is also a robustness to Pedri’s game. No one played more minutes for Las Palmas in the Segunda Division last season than the skinny teenager with the rolled-down socks, and he has already made 42 appearances for Barcelona this time around. Pedri is currently ranked fifth in    , one place ahead of Barcelona team-mate Ansu Fati. He was born just 25 days after Fati in 2002 and, together, they bring hope of a brighter future to a club that has been mired in relentless off-field turmoil over the last year. Pedri’s story begins in the Canary Islands, which also produced the likes of  , and Pedro, the former Barcelona and Chelsea winger. He comes from a family of Barcelona fans and idolised Iniesta as a child, watching all of the matches and YouTube videos he could. At Las Palmas he was promoted to the first team at the age of 16, before then becoming the club’s youngest ever goalscorer. Such was the size of the impression he made, Barcelona agreed the deal to sign him after he had played only three senior matches for Las Palmas.  Pepe Mel, his coach at Las Palmas, believes Pedri could be an ""era-defining"" player. ""He keeps it simple and he helps all his team-mates to raise their game,"" Mel has said. Ronald Koeman, Pedri’s manager at Barcelona, said ""no one has surprised me more than he has"". For all the criticism that Barcelona have faced for their financial troubles, and for all the questionable big-money signings they have made in recent years, they surely deserve credit for acting so swiftly to secure Pedri.  If circumstances were just a little different, though, he might have been playing for Real Madrid: he went for a trial there at the age of 15, but the process was severely disrupted by heavy snow.  ""Barca is the club that counted on Pedri the most,"" Las Palmas president Miguel Angel Ramirez told Cadena SER. ""There was another club from Spain that offered more money, but we kept our word. He has gone to the perfect club and is now playing with the best player in the world."" Talent recognises talent, as they say, and it is Pedri’s relationship with Messi that has arguably been the most exciting element of his development. While other big names (Antoine Griezmann and Philippe Coutinho, for example) have struggled to connect with Messi on the pitch, Pedri has always been on the same wavelength as his captain. ""I look for him on the pitch because he always knows what he is doing,"" Pedri told  . ""He has always tried to find me and tells me to put myself between the lines because he is going to find me.""  The challenge for Pedri, as the spotlight grows ever brighter, is to maintain that connection and to continue this rate of development. Already his life has changed to reflect his status — he took a taxi to his first few home games for Barcelona because he had not passed his driving test, but was then allocated a club driver.  It all makes for a new reality for Pedri, and it has all changed so quickly for a player who does not turn 19 until November, but there has been nothing to suggest he cannot cope. Creative, diligent, reliable and durable: Pedri looks set to be one of Europe’s leading midfielders for the next decade at least.",1

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/womens-sport/2021/03/31/jill-ellis-matt-beard-andjayne-ludlow-frontrunners-replace/,sport,"Former US World Cup winning coach Jill Ellis and ex-Wales manager Jayne Ludlow are two leading contenders linked with succeeding Arsenal manager Joe Montemurro this summer. The Australian on Wednesday announced he would be leaving the Women's Super League club at the end of this season after three and a half years in charge to spend more time with his family. Muntemurro, who led the Gunners to their first Women’s Super League title in seven years in 2019, said he wanted his decision to be made public so the club could “get the process going” of finding his successor The 51-year-old cited being away from his family behind his decision but added it “felt like the right time” to step away from football “in the context of where I am as a coach”  “It’s been a cycle of nine years in which I haven’t really stopped,” said Montemurro,  “You know what it’s like in the off season, you get your three, four weeks [off] but you don’t stop, you’re always thinking about recruiting staff, playing and going forward and it’s not really a break. Just to not think about football for a while is going to be really nice, [but] really strange.” Montemurro would not be drawn on whether he would play an active role in helping to find his successor, but stressed that “there’s enough good people” at Arsenal for such a process.  Who next for Arsenal? Interest in Arsenal’s managerial vacancy will be vast, but few coaches will have the credentials and experience to fit the bill for one of the biggest jobs in the sport. Whoever comes in will be tasked with not only continuing with the dynamic, passing style of football Montemurro has overseen, but most importantly with trying to reassert Britain’s most successful women’s team historically back at the summit of the English game and not allow Chelsea and Manchester City’s recent stranglehold to continue any longer. That will be hugely difficult. Former Wales manager Jayne Ludlow will be among the strongest contenders, not least because of her links with Arsenal, where she spent 13 years of her successful playing career.   The 42-year-old was an integral part of the Arsenal side that won a historic quadruple of trophies in 2007 and was among the legends of an era where the club enjoyed unprecedented dominance of the game. Ludlow left her role as Wales coach by mutual consent in January after seven years in charge. She has taken up a role with Fifa but is understood to be interested in the right club job. Winner of the  , Jill Ellis is arguably the highest-profile manager in the women’s game and the fact she also happens to be English will inevitably mean she is closely linked with any big jobs in the WSL. The 54-year-old from Portsmouth stepped down from her role with the US national team shortly after 2019’s world title and she was understood to be among the interviewed candidates for the England job in 2020, before Holland’s  . Given her almost unrivalled international success and her extensive honours list, Ellis can rightly command a large salary, and that might be a slight stumbling block for Arsenal. But many fans of the north London club will hope the club will at least be speaking to her. As one of only five different managers to have won the WSL, Matt Beard has the necessary experience to help Arsenal mount a serious title challenge again, having won the league twice with Liverpool in 2013 and 2014. He is currently providing maternity cover for Bristol City manager Tanya Oxtoby until the end of the season, but is set to be a free agent this summer, with his stock high after turning the West Country club’s form around. But would Arsenal's board consider the leap from the Robins to the north Londoners to be too great? If Arsenal were to look to a former manager, Laura Harvey is as good as they come and guided Arsenal to the 2011 and 2012 WSL titles. However, she is currently employed as the United States’ Under-20 coach and is reportedly happy on the other side of the pond. Arsenal are currently fourth in the WSL table and on a four-game winning run as they continue to target a Champions League spot for next season. Under his three and a half year tenure, Arsenal have reached four domestic cup finals, including back-to-back Continental League Cup wins, and a Champions League quarter-final. Montemurro said he was a “mess” when he told players of his decision after training on Wednesday, a moment he described as “teary”.  “It was extremely difficult because we’ve built some great friendships,” said Montemurro.  “They’ve all had an effect on me, every player, even ones that are not with me here and have moved on. “The biggest thing I was scared of was that they’d be upset and never let me back into the club, but I can sit here and safely say that I’m forever part of the Arsenal family and I was one of the lucky ones who got to work here.”",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/03/31/jack-grealishs-big-summer-did-aston-villa-reach-100m-valuation/,sport,"The chronology of a season can sometimes warp perception, and it should not be forgotten just how good Jack Grealish's performances  Grealish is entering his prime   in the first portion of the campaign. He appeared to gain a yard of pace and even accounting for a spell on the sidelines, his statistics speak for themselves.  Only Kevin De Bruyne has more expected assists per 90 minutes, only Bruno Fernandes has played more key passes while Harry Kane and Fernandes are the only players with more goal-creating actions than Grealish this Premier League season.  His form earned him England starts in the autumn, although his place in Gareth Southgate's XI at the European Championship is likely to be a keen subject of debate. With Manchester City and Manchester United admirers, it could be a crucial summer for Grealish on and off the pitch.   assesses his options:  Aston Villa are in a very strong position after tying down Grealish to a five-year contract last summer. Villa’s wealthy owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens oversaw the fifth-highest net transfer spend in the Premier League last summer, in spite of the financial impact of the pandemic. They do not appear desperate to balance the books with a big sale.   Villa valued Grealish at £70m last year but that asking price has increased to more than £100m now. That figure corresponds nicely to the cost of relegation; essentially, Villa would want to be compensated for the increased risk of relegation the loss of Grealish would bring.  That is a more remote prospect than it was 12 months ago. Dean Smith's squad has greater depth of quality, with the addition of Ollie Watkins, Ross Barkley and Bertrand Traore diversifying their attacking threat, and Villa have spent the entirety of the season in the top half. Rather than worrying about relegation, Villa will now be determined to keep Grealish in order to challenge for Europe once again. Since Grealish's shin injury, Villa have won just one of their last six Premier League games.  Grealish's situation at Villa is frequently compared to Wilfried Zaha at Crystal Palace, but Villa look the more comfortable Premier League outfit despite this being their second season back. Losing Zaha would have almost rubber-stamped relegation for Palace, but Villa's position is not as perilous. Zaha appears to regret signing a long-term deal that has proved prohibitive to potential buyers, but Grealish is three years younger and so could be viewed as more worthy of a British record transfer fee.  This may be a sad reflection on English football considering we are talking about the fifth-most successful club in the country, but Aston Villa are not going to win the Premier League. There will forever be one fewer nought on the bookmakers' odds since Leicester City's 2016 fairytale but it is cosmically unlikely to be repeated. Villa will start each season as underdogs to finish in the Europa League places, never mind qualify for the Champions League.  They could be a danger in the cup competitions, reaching the Carabao Cup final in 2020, and perhaps that will suffice for Grealish. Villa have not won major silverware since the 1996 League Cup under Brian Little, and inspiring Villa to a trophy while wearing the captain's armband would certainly stir Grealish as a boyhood fan of the club. One trophy with Aston Villa could be worth 10 won elsewhere.  Staying at Villa could also be beneficial for Grealish as an individual: he is already considered one of the league's star players and everything at Villa Park is geared towards getting the best out of him. Just as Harry Kane could smash individual records and become a club legend (if he isn't already) by staying at Tottenham, Grealish might be driven by more personal motivations.  When it comes to assessing players and managers, it certainly feels as if football has moved on from the maxims of 'show us your medals' and 'it's a results business'. A more complex range of factors are now considered: issues of identity, belonging and whether the player or coach is the right 'fit' for a club. Grealish fits Villa, of that there can be no doubt. Matt Le Tissier was accused of a lack of ambition for not leaving Southampton, but one gets the sense today's football public would be more sympathetic.  The brutal truth though, is that if Grealish wants to satisfy the urge for a title he will need to go elsewhere. There are also financial incentives. Football is just like any other business: people move jobs to get paid. Players want to maximise the value of a short career and Grealish is no different.  United are one of the few clubs with the financial clout to buy Grealish. Paying a premium for the best British talent from within the Premier League fits the pattern of United's recruitment over the last few decades, especially now that players from the Sir Alex Ferguson-era are the club's key decision-makers.  Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team lacked creativity and invention against deep-lying defences in his early days, though this has been alleviated since Bruno Fernandes' arrival. Grealish's dashing style, technical arrogance and willingness to take players on certainly marks him out as a potential 'United player' (a slightly woolly concept but we shall let that slide for now).  while Paul Pogba rediscovering his best form mean United are not quite as desperate for an attacking midfielder. Grealish has also played his best football for Aston Villa from the left, where United are quite well stocked: Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Pogba all favour that side. Perhaps Grealish could enable Rashford to move through the middle but is that his optimal role? Furthermore, is Rashford the kind of striker Solskjaer wants to play with week-in, week-out?  United's principal problem in attack has been finding a player to occupy the right flank. Mason Greenwood has done well, but will naturally look to come inside and get shots off. United pursued Jadon Sancho and looked at Watford's Ismaïla Sarr because they wanted a player who could hold his width to balance off their right-footed forward on the left. This position, as well as striker, centre-back and central midfield, look a bigger priority than the areas Grealish likes to occupy.  City have the firepower to make significant acquisitions despite the pandemic. Grealish's quality in tight spaces makes it easy to imagine him in a Pep Guardiola team, against the low blocks Manchester City face every week. Guardiola loves attacking midfielders who can also dribble and unbalance opposition defences, once stating that it was Andres Iniesta who taught him the importance of having this type in the team. Direct comparisons are best avoided, but there are stylistic parallels between Grealish and Iniesta as right-footed dribblers who like to make out-to-in runs from the left.  In a squad like City's, Grealish would not necessarily replace a particular player in the starting XI but be one of several blue-chip attacking options. He could play on the left of the front three with Raheem Sterling switching back to the right. Or he could move inside as a left-sided No 8 in the position Ilkay Gundogan has occupied this season, with the German midfielder now past 30. Those are two of the most simple solutions - the possibilities are endless.  However,  , City's attention is squarely on Erling Haaland following the announcement that Sergio Aguero will depart at the end of the season. Despite their vast wealth, City are quite measured in the transfer market and buying two players of this stature in one window seems unlikely.  Liverpool's forward line is perhaps in need of a refresh, but they are one of the big clubs suffering the costs of the pandemic. Reports suggest and Liverpool under FSG are not associated with buying the biggest names on the market. Diogo Jota was signed last season and likes that inside left slot, and is closer to what Klopp wants in his wide forwards than Grealish: runs in behind and goals. Grealish is out of Tottenham and Arsenal's financial reach. Could Grealish move abroad? ""If I’m Barcelona I’m buying him tomorrow morning it doesn’t matter how much it is,"" said former Arsenal and Villa player Paul Merson.  “I’m buying Jack Grealish because Jack Grealish at the Nou Camp would absolutely rip it up.” A nice idea, but Spain's biggest clubs are drowning in debt and in need of financial restructuring. For the first time in decades, Barcelona and Real Madrid might not be big players in the market.  Winning greater recognition at international level is sometimes a motivation for players moving to one of the bigger clubs, but that is not really the case for Grealish. Southgate is aware of his quality and has included him in recent squads.  Rather than a question of how much Grealish is rated, the tension with England appears to be a tactical one. Harry Kane is undroppable and,  , likes to roll off the forward line to link play (something he is very good at). Management is about finding balance however, and if your striker is doing this then he needs to be surrounded by players who make runs in behind. When Kane drags out centre-backs, there is green grass to exploit, something Heung-min Son does brilliantly alongside Kane for Spurs.  Fitness permitting, it seems Southgate wants to recreate this dynamic with Rashford from the left. It makes perfect sense, though it is harsh on Grealish. Playing Grealish alongside Kane in the same front three, with Mason Mount or Phil Foden in the team, risks making England too static and predictable with one too many players coming short to receive the ball to feet. Nevertheless, Grealish will surely be involved in some capacity. ",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2021/03/31/andy-murray-golf-caddie-could-cope-withno-contracts-no-pay/,sport,"As a Briton who can play tennis rather well,  , so it should be no surprise to find him eyeing up a career in golf in a manner so different to some of his colleagues. Ivan Lendl and Yevgeny Kafelnikov are two just grand slammers who thought they could hack it on the professional fairways when they zipped up their rackets. And they actually did go and hack up those perfectly manicured layouts in true hacker style when they dared tee it up in elite-golf competition.  Of the 15 invites Kafelnikov received for the European Tour and its feeder league, the Challenge Tour, he made exactly no cuts. Neither did Lendl.  . As we know, Murray, god bless him, is not an arrogant man and that is why he is peering several rungs down the food chain when it comes to his tennis afterlife in those pearly-gated country clubs.  “I really like golf and being a caddie on Tour would be exciting,"" he told Gentleman's Journal.  “To be up close and personal with top golfers and to learn about another sport like that. There’s probably also some crossover between tennis and golf on the mental side and things, and helping a golfer with that might be interesting.” It certainly might. In fact, it would be fascinating to see a knight of the realm carrying someone else’s clubs and being screamed at on the fourth fairway for having the wrong flavour protein bar in the bag.  How “up close and personal” does he fancy? Probably nose-to-nose if he thinks that as a 15-handicapper who shot 101 at Wentworth recently, can help out on the “mental side” of hitting a three iron 250 yards to that 18th green guarded by a lake. A forehand smash might just be the start of it. . On hearing about Murray’s impending application, The Tour Caddies, a group of some of the shrewdest operators out there, tweeted that it could be the ideal occupation for the 33-year-old, so long as he likes “a: dodgy Airbnbs, b: low job security and c: shouting at people to turn off their mobile phones.” Of course, the first two would not be a problem as Murray has the finances to travel in the same class of cabins and stay in the same hotels (although for his employer’s ego that could be an issue in itself). But acting as both a dogsbody and bodyguard for the pro could pose their own psychological challenges for a multi-millionaire. The lack of respect would surely get to him - and that does not necessarily come from the players, themselves. On the PGA Tour caddies are not generally allowed in the clubhouse, are certainly not permitted in the locker rooms and, on occasion, have disgracefully not been provided with adequate shelter for storms. The caddies refer to themselves as “rats” and the self-definition is only partly in jest. There are no contracts, no pay-offs, no sick pay. At the Masters they are instructed to wear those uncomfortable white jumpsuits and at regular events don garish bibs that are essentially advertising placards, with no cut of the bounty. The rewards? Those working for the top guys earn substantial sums, but the average looper struggles from week-to-week. And on the female tours it is worse. And how would Murray, a two-time gold medallist, being a caddie at the Olympics work?  Unlike coxes in the rowing races, caddies are not considered eligible for medals, but just like coxes they are required to undergo drugs testing if asked. In fairness, there will be other “competitors” in Tokyo being treated the same – the horses in the equestrian events. “But at least they'll get good wash down and a polo mint,” one caddie remarked. Murray would be appalled, but then, as a character who has regularly spoken up for women's rights, maybe he could emerge as the shop steward for this downtrodden section of humanity. The caddies could do with a champion of their cause.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2021/03/31/exclusive-lions-consider-channel-islands-pre-tour-bonding-trip/,sport,"The British and Irish Lions are considering holding a 10-day training camp in both Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey before departing for South Africa even though the  Warren Gatland, the Lions head coach had first explored the option of basing his squad in Jersey in case the tour had to be relocated to the UK and Ireland because of the global pandemic. revealed last Tuesday however that the Lions board had decided to proceed with the tour in South Africa after concluding the ‘home series’ option was not feasible for time, logistic and cost reasons. Gatland was so impressed with the facilities on the island however that the Lions are still considering using it for their pre-tour camp ahead of the game against Japan at Murrayfield on June 26. And it is understood that the head coach is now also exploring the option of spending several days training at Guernsey RFC in order to break up the 10-day camp that is set to assemble on June 14 for those players not involved in the Premiership semi-finals and final, which coincides with the game against Japan. Any players involved in the Pro 14 Rainbow Cup final on June 19 should be able to join up with the Lions in camp on the following day. The attraction of staging the camp on the Channel Islands is multi-layered. Jersey and Guernsey have the benefit of being both a neutral and a fresh venue - four years ago, the two-week training camp was staged at the national training bases of Wales and Ireland before the tour of New Zealand. Traditional 'bonding' sessions - key to successful Lions tours - are likely to be possible on the islands as the Covid protocols are much more relaxed because of the low rates of infection.  All restrictions are due to be lifted completely the same day that the camp is due to start. Given that the squad is likely to face biosecure bubble restrictions when they are in South Africa,  .   The state-of-the-art facilities at Strive, an elite performance complex currently under construction on land adjacent to the Jersey Reds clubs, includes an altitude chamber which will allow the players to prepare for the ‘thin air’ in Highveld in South Africa. The Lions squad will then travel to Edinburgh on June 24 for their final preparations for the game against Japan before  The decision has also been taken to scrap the traditional ‘farewell’ dinner, which is normally held on the night before departure. The dinner had become an overly corporate affair for sponsors and even before the pandemic restrictions was unlikely to be staged given the decision to travel to South Africa on the day after the Japan game. Meanwhile, the traditional ‘Messy Monday’ day when players first assemble to receive their kit and have medical checks and photo shoot is scheduled for a Wednesday for the first time (May 26) ahead of the final round of regular Premiership fixtures, which should avoid the friction of four years ago when it was held on the week that Saracens were preparing for their European Champions Cup final against Clermont Auvergne in Edinburgh.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2021/03/31/tackling-lions-south-africa-have-not-played-test-500-days/,sport,"South Africa have not played a Test match in over 500 days. Let that sink in. The decision to not participate in last year’s Rugby Championship has meant that the Springboks have not played together since brushing England aside in the Rugby World Cup final. Given how much thought and speculation goes into selecting everybody’s British and Irish Lions XV for the first Test, it only seems right to wonder how the Springboks will line up, having not played a Test match in close to 20 months. New head coach Jacques Nienaber has had no opportunity to work with most of his players, outside of last October’s ‘Springbok Showdown’ last year when a ‘Green’ side, coached by Nienaber’s predecessor Rassie Erasmus, took on Nienaber’s ‘Gold’ side back in October.  That fixture, however, only included players based in South Africa which, given the large number of frontline Springboks playing   in England, France and Japan, hardly gave Nienaber a full hand to work with. Also, the quality of the ‘Springbok Showdown’ was criticised on social media, given it essentially served as a pre-season outing ahead of the Currie Cup. Below, we look at the Springboks’ preparations, where the side from the World Cup final are now, some new faces who may break into the squad and predict the XV that will face the Lions in the first Test on July 24 in Johannesburg. Unconfirmed reports have suggested that South Africa will face the USA in a warm-up fixture ahead of facing the Lions, with USA head coach Gary Gold   that an offer had been made to play the Springboks before the Lions series. South Africa’s Super Rugby franchises are currently competing in pre-season ahead of the Guinness Pro14 Rainbow Cup, when the Bulls, Lions (SA), Sharks and Stormers will play against the current Pro14 sides, starting with derbies between the Bulls and Lions plus the Sharks against the Stormers on April 24. The final of the Rainbow Cup is scheduled for June 19, although depending on results the South African sides’ participation could be over by June 12.  That would give Nienaber and his coaching staff extra preparation time compared to the British and Irish Lions, with the Gallagher Premiership season not concluding until June 26, the same day the Lions face Japan at Murrayfield, and the tour then starting the following week on July 3 when the Lions face the Stormers in Cape Town.  - Left Wasps before the Rugby World Cup to sign for Toyota Verblitz in Japan, where he’s currently based.  - Still one of the best attackers in the game for Toulouse, with seven tries in the Top 14 this season.  - One of the breakout stars of the World Cup. Captained the Sharks to defeat in the Currie Cup final back in January.  - Signed for Munster after the World Cup and has made 18 appearances, overcoming a groin injury.  - Scored five tries for the Sharks in Super Rugby last year before the tournament was cancelled. Now in Japan with NTT Red Hurricanes.  - Joined Montpellier after the Rugby World Cup but ruptured his ACL last September, but he is on track to return in time for the Lions. - Still Sale’s talisman and his form has not dipped since the World Cup, making him a starter in the summer.  - Retired from Test rugby with the RWC final being  . Now in the US playing for Washington-based Old Glory DC.  - Good enough to play anywhere in the world but still in Cape Town with Western Province and the Stormers, for now. Has been linked with Harlequins.  - Signed a new contract to remain with the Stormers this week, turning down a deal in Japan, having been with the franchise now for a decade.   - Linked up with Toulon following the World Cup where he has been an important senior player in a rebuilding job.  - Had a disjointed start to life at Sale, with the 6ft 9in lock battling a shoulder injury, but he’s now building up steam under Alex Sanderson.  - The Springbok captain has swapped the Stormers for the Sharks in South Africa, a big move, and became the first rugby player to sign with agency Roc Nation   - The 2019 World Rugby men’s player of the year   at the start of 2020 and is now close to a return. Was linked with Munster but set to head to Japan.  - Returned from playing in Japan to join Jake White’s revolution at the Bulls, captaining the side to winning the Currie Cup back in January.   - Has spent the last two years in Japan, first with NTT Com Shining Arcs and now at Kubota Spears. Still yet to enter the prime of his career at 26. - Based with the Stormers after a brief stint in France before the 2019 RWC, and now the premier loosehead with Mtawarira retired. - Has stuck with Saracens dropping down to the Championship, starting this season in their defeat at Cornish Pirates. Playing at that level might hurt his chances.  - Snapped up by Munster along with De Allende to add some bulk, but the lock has been out for several months since damaging his ACL.  - Left Gloucester in June last year with the season on hold and has now taken up a contract in Japan with Honda Heat.  - Now retired after an excellent career with the Springboks and also with Bath,   - South Africa’s bolter in 2019 will be in the mix again for selection, continuing to play well for the Stormers.  - The veteran is now back in South Africa after leaving Montpellier, heading home to the Free State to play for the Cheetahs at 33. You wouldn’t rule him out.  - Retired and turns 40 in May, with the former Saracen having previously come out of retirement to be part of the World Cup squad in Japan two years ago.  - Was playing for Toulouse as a World Cup joker before getting the call to head to Japan to replace the injured Trevor Nyakane. Now back in South Africa with the Sharks.  - Unlucky to pick up an injury in South Africa’s opening game against New Zealand. Another Currie Cup winner with the Bulls in January.  - Excellent on the Sevens circuit for many years before switching to XVs to make the World Cup squad. Now in Japan with Yamaha Jubilo.  - A fan favourite at Northampton Saints before departing last summer to join Montpellier in France, where the Top 14 side have only won seven league matches this season.  - Still running the show for the Lions and has captained the side recently in pre-season ahead of the new season. - Recently re-signed to stay in the Western Cape, the much-hyped fly-half/full-back is still yet to fulfil his potential.  - Another player to unfortunately pick up an injury in that opening game against New Zealand, when he came off the bench. Now in Japan with Canon Eagles.  - Hugely exciting talent on the wing who has combined well with Lukhanyo Am for the Sharks recently and will be in the mix. - Recovering from a long-term injury having recently moved south to the Stormers from the Bulls, where he’s a frontrunner for the full-back slot. As you can see from the above, only three of the squad from 2019 have since retired from Tests - Mtawarira, Louw and Brits - with a couple of older players in Vermeulen and Steyn still around and playing well enough to be considered to face the Lions. However, there are a number of players who have put their hands up too, either in South Africa during last year’s Super Rugby and Currie Cup campaigns or based overseas. Possibly the strongest pick of the lot from this list. Fassi was a lot of fun to watch for the Sharks in Super Rugby last year and a regular during his side’s run to the Currie Cup final, despite suffering a shoulder injury that kept him out for three months last year.  Fassi’s taller than Le Roux and has electric pace, and while you can understand if Jacques Nienaber sticks with the more experienced option of Le Roux, Fassi would be a box-office addition to South Africa’s backline. Simelane, a standout a Under-20 level, won Backline Player of the Year, as voted by South Africa’s professional rugby players at the end of 2020 after an excellent spell for the Lions. In a similar position to Fassi, in that Simelane might be a talent for a few years down the road given there are experienced options ahead of him in Am, De Allende and Kriel. But it would be good to see Simelane in the mix. Dweba earned a move to France after some remarkable form for Cheetahs, winning Currie Cup Player of the Year in 2019 and scoring seven tries in the Pro14 before the season was cancelled. He was also named by Rugbyrama as one of the top 10 summer signings in France back in January. On that form, he at least deserves a chance. Van der Merwe has been capped by the Springboks before, back in 2018, but has looked excellent for Sale this season, incredibly physical with his ball-carrying. Plus, a call-up would increase the possibility of him playing against his brother, Scotland wing Duhan, who impressed in the Six Nations. Unfortunate to miss out on selection for the World Cup after the late surge made by Herschel Jantjies, but Papier has continued to play well for the Bulls, including in their recent Currie Cup triumph. Could be chosen as a third scrum-half ahead of Reinach. As has too often been the case in his career, injury might hinder Coetzee’s chances of being involved against the Lions, with the Ulster flanker set to return to South Africa soon after many years in Belfast where he has put together some excellent performances. A brilliant ball-carrier and threat over the breakdown.  and There’s real competition for the back-up loosehead shirt behind Steven Kitshoff, and Gqoboka and Nché faced off against each other recently in the Currie Cup final. Nché has impressed in the loose, showing good speed and hands, while Gqoboka wasn’t far away from making the World Cup squad. It’s a tight call, hence including both of them here. Incredibly athletic back-row forward, previously with the Stormers, who was one of the standouts in Super Rugby 2020 before the tournament was cancelled. About to combine with Kolisi again, this time in Durban, and deserves another look after six caps in 2018. The lack of preparation time, and the fact that only two players from the matchday 23 who won in Yokohama have retired, suggests that Nienaber will attempt to pick a similar XV to the World Cup final. The options of a six-two and five-three bench split have both been included among the replacements, given South Africa’s preference for the former during the World Cup. Kitshoff replacing Mtawarira as the starting loosehead is fairly automatic, and while Fassi will push Le Roux hard, you expect Nienaber to stick with experience. On the bench, someone needs to fill the 17 shirt and Nché could edge out Gqoboka, while Coetzee, almost out of sentiment and hoping he recovers from injury in time to be part of this series, would be the replacement back-row ahead of Notshe or potentially Kwagga Smith. A six-two split would also mean opting for a fly-half option in the 23 shirt, meaning Francois Steyn getting in ahead of Jesse Kriel. The concerns for Nienaber have to be the fitness of Pollard and Du Toit, both vital players for this side, although it seems the worst is over for Du Toit, now back in training having recovered from that concerning thigh injury, meaning he should return to the field soon. Pollard, meanwhile, is still on the mend and while the signs are positive, should he not be ready in time that would open the door for Elton Jantjies. Or, and whisper his name in fear if you’re still scarred from 2009, a resurgent Morné Steyn, who has just won another Currie Cup with the Bulls at 36. Wouldn’t that be something.",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2021/03/31/creeping-influence-rajasthan-royals-english-cricket/,sport,"Who runs English cricket? The Rajasthan Royals or the England & Wales Cricket Board? The answer is the ECB of course but the Royals are becoming an ever more influential presence with contacts at the very top level of decision making in English cricket. We are not just talking about the cream of England talent on their payroll: Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer. But their influence stretches deeper, all the way to the ECB’s executive board. On Nov 2 last year the ECB announced that Ron Kalifa had joined its board as an independent non-executive director. He was already a member of the Hundred board and the ECB’s audit and risk committee. Kalifa is a successful businessman who is a director of the Bank of England, a non-executive director for Transport for London and previously led Worldpay, a technology payments company. Clearly a man of talent the ECB needs as it negotiates the pandemic and the changing world of digital revenue streams. On Jan 15 this year, two months after Kalifa was appointed an ECB non-executive director,  the Rajasthan Royals announced its lead investor, Emerging Media, had increased its shareholding in the franchise to over 50 percent through new equity fundraising worth a reported £25m. Its press release announced Kalifa as one of a “number of new individual investors”.  Manoj Badale, the owner of Emerging Media and Royals co-founder, said: “Investors are now recognising the value of sports franchises. EMIPL’s increased ownership of the franchise and expanded network of US-based, value-add investors presents an exciting opportunity to drive the growth of both the Rajasthan Royals and the IPL.” The IPL and English cricket has never been closer. The launch of the Hundred this year is the ECB’s attempt to copy the success of the IPL. Last week  revealed the board is considering   hoping it will lead Indian players to play in the competition, boosting its value overseas considerably.  This week the IPL versus England debate deepened when Ashley Giles, the England team director, said he worried   and the ECB and sign IPL deals instead if they curbed their participation in the tournament. This summer we could see Stokes, Buttler and Archer (fitness permitting) playing in the IPL final rather than a Test match at Lord’s, the first time England fans will have seen the team in action in the flesh for more than 12 months.  An ECB spokesman denied there is a conflict of interest: ""Ron was appointed to the ECB Board after a rigorous selection process. His interest in the Rajasthan Royals was fully declared and he is not involved in Board discussions if there is any conflict. We are comfortable that this does not present any issues with his position on the Board."" Last week the ECB announced that Delia Bushell was not going to seek a second term as a non-executive director of the ECB. A press release said she was now “engaged in advisory and investment work for the sport and media sectors, so has decided not to seek a second term on the ECB Board given the conflicts that might arise with her new role.” The board clearly takes conflicts of interest seriously.  The Royals-ECB link does not end at Kalifa. Sir Andrew Strauss is chairman of the ECB’s cricket committee, an influential role that has power over how the professional game is played in England. He also attends ECB board meetings in a non-voting capacity, invited by Ian Watmore when he took over as chairman in September last year. Strauss is a consultant for the Rajasthan Royals, advising on cricket matters similar to his role with the ECB. Since leaving his job as England’s director of cricket in 2018, Strauss has become a freelance cricket consultant. He is entitled to work for wherever he can.  Rajasthan have made no secret of their links with England, and have positioned themselves as the most English of the IPL franchises.  The Royals appointed a new chief executive in September, Mike Fordham. Fordham is a former employee of the ECB. He was instrumental in setting up the Hundred competition with Tom Harrison, who recruited him from IMG where they used to be colleagues, and where Fordham helped establish the IPL. Fordham left the ECB in 2019. Before joining Rajasthan, Fordham worked briefly as a consultant for Oakwell Sports Advisory group, specialists at linking corporate finance with sport. Fordham was one of the the authors of a report released by Oakwell last April, at the height of the pandemic when English cricket was fearing a blank summer and losses of more than £300m, that recommended the ECB sell equity in Hundred teams to private financiers in India, where there is no shortage of rich businessmen looking to buy into cricket. Not many have better inside knowledge of English cricket and the Hundred than Fordham. His report concluded selling equity in the Hundred would help alleviate covid losses and increase interest in India. “The Hundred needs to be able to attract Indian players and subsequently an Indian fanbase too,” it said. “The Indian subcontinent constitutes 90% of the 1 billion cricket fans aged 16-69 globally. Indian investment into the Hundred, including from IPL team owners may facilitate the involvement of Indian players in the longer term. In addition to generating revenue out of India, this would be vital in unlocking the South Asian UK-based fanbase.”  and a sensible move given it would take some of the soaring cost base off the ECB and bring new money, new ideas to a tournament that has no history and is essentially a blank piece of paper.  Badale told   last year: “We would naturally have a look, as we do at opportunities all over the world, and particularly given our huge fan following in the UK.” Kumar Sangakkara was appointed Royals’ director of cricket in January. Sangakkara is also president of the MCC. Cricket is a small world, and connections are everywhere so it is no surprise that an IPL franchise with a British founder has established links within English cricket. But it is a big change from a decade ago. Then the Royals linked up with Hampshire as they dreamt of creating the world’s first franchise across continents. However the ECB, spooked by the move, were very hostile at that point. Hampshire and the Royals was an experiment that did not last. Now the Royals influence is more subtle.  Why does this matter? There is no suggestion anyone is working against the interests of English cricket and all are incredibly experienced, knowledgeable figures the sport benefits from having on board. But it’s important to realise the IPL’s tentacles are not just limited to the cricket field and player appearances. It’s creeping into more and more aspects of English cricket. ",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/03/31/teams-could-allowed-expanded-euro-2021-squads-ease-covid-disruption/,sport,"Talks have begun to allow England to name a squad larger than 23 players for the European Championship,   can reveal. Uefa’s executive committee was told on Wednesday that relaxing squad limits would be considered when it came to drafting the tournament regulations in a bid to stop it being wrecked by coronavirus. That could either mean teams  or designated players being kept on standby in the event of a Covid-19 outbreak. As revealed by  , England players and staff could also be banned from mixing with family and friends while involved in the Euros to avoid spreading the virus amid doubts they will be fully vaccinated in time. Both measures will be considered to stop the forfeiting of matches at the tournament, something that could see a country eliminated without kicking a ball. Relaxing normal squad limits would mirror the action taken by Uefa to prevent its other competitions being thrown into chaos, with teams able to call on additional players in the event of a spate of Covid-19 cases. With no real scope for rearranging matches at the Euros, it would be unthinkable for such a decision not to be made unless all squads were vaccinated beforehand given the dire consequences of games not taking place. The same could apply when it comes to deciding whether to ban players and staff from mixing with family and friends, a measure that has been imposed on England’s cricketers while they are on international duty. As revealed   the current timetable for the vaccine rollout in the UK means players based here may not receive their first doses until May at the earliest and may not get a second before the Euros finish. Normally, countries are limited to a squad of 23 players. They are unable to call up replacements in the event of injury or illness. Because of the coronavirus crisis. A major outbreak of Covid-19 in a squad could mean countries simply do not have enough players allowed to play a match. With no real scope for rearranging fixtures at the Euros, that country would otherwise be forced to forfeit the game. That could see them eliminated without kicking a ball and lead to millions being paid in compensation to broadcasters and other impacted parties. Countries will either be allowed to select larger squads than 23 or submit a list of designated standby players they could call upon only in the event of an outbreak of the virus. Uefa has already relaxed squad limits in its club competitions and the current Under-21 Championship finals, at which teams are able to call upon players outside of squad lists submitted before those competitions began. Regulations for these state matches will go ahead as long as a team has 13 eligible players available including at least one goalkeeper.",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2021/03/31/jofra-archer-has-endured-wasted-winter-jon-lewis-can-put-england/,sport,"Jofra Archer underwent successful surgery to his right hand on Monday, with a fragment of glass removed from the middle finger of his right hand, according to an ECB statement. Having a piece of glass in his bowling hand, since an accident  , goes a long way to explaining why Archer was not at his best this winter. He led the T20 attack in India and had only one bad game, the last, when England went down 3-2. But, having been rested for the Test series in Sri Lanka, Archer did not really strike in the Test series in India - not that any pace bowler did. In two Tests he took four wickets, and had to miss the last Test with another injury to his right elbow, which has been troubling him on and off for more than a year. ""Archer will now commence two weeks of rehabilitation,"" the ECB added. ""Further update on his elbow injury will be provided once he has returned to bowling to assess the effectiveness of his recent injection."" Only when Archer has returned to bowling will the ECB decide on  . Either way, another winter has passed  - or even another year. James Anderson and Stuart Broad were given the new ball last summer ahead of England’s fastest bowler, and as often as not Chris Woakes would also bowl ahead of Archer, so that he was reduced to fourth seamer in the pecking order. Archer took 22 wickets in his four Tests, at only 20 runs each in the white heat of an Ashes series in 2019. Dukes ball, yes, in England, yes, but it was still the most impressive of debuts. Stuart Broad would take the first over and nip out David Warner, then Archer would take the new ball at the other end, work up through the gears in his old-fashioned style, and scare the wits out of Australia’s batsmen, who had seen nothing like it from an England bowler in their living memory except Andrew Flintoff in 2005. Archer, subsequently, in nine Tests, has taken 20 wickets at 42.9 each. Sometimes he has started a spell in third gear, and stayed in third gear, so his strike-rate has been one Test wicket every 14 overs. His batting too has gone backwards. He was averaging 31 for Sussex when he was picked for England. He could bat properly, at eight or nine. Darren Gough was the same, a bowling all-rounder when he made his England debut, before sliding down the order to No 11 and batting like one. A terrific waste in both cases. There are two sources of encouragement though. One is that the England selectors and management have been finally strong enough to insist that Anderson and Broad should no longer play together, except in exceptional circumstances,  . Archer this summer may be allowed the new ball again. Secondly, Jon Lewis was appointed England’s pace bowling coach last month on a full-time basis. Archer turns 26 on Thursday, and if anyone is going to get the best out of him it is the man who coached Archer when he was blossoming at Sussex. While a tough and uncompromising heavy-duty seamer himself in county cricket with one Test for England, Lewis belongs to the kind and considerate school of coaching, and was also Archer's landlord in Brighton. Lewis has allowed Archer to warm up in his own way like former fast bowlers used to do, by merely turning his arm over before the start then easing into his work and building up pace during a spell. This did not go down well with the management when England first went on tour with Archer to New Zealand, but Lewis knows his man.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2021/03/31/many-scotland-players-should-go-lions-tour/,sport,"Following  , it did not take long for focus to shift to Lions selection. Gregor Townsend backed his players to the hilt once again, indicating that as many as or eight or nine Scotland players should be included in Warren Gatland’s squad, particularly   and in the Stade de France. In both 2013 and 2017, just three Scots were in the initial touring party. This number is almost certain to increase, but the question remains how many Scotland players should tour? It is easy to recognise the quality of this Scotland side, but earning selection over players from three other nations requires more than just being a good international player. In certain positions it requires being genuinely exceptional.   assesses which Scotland players should go on the Lions tour on a case-by-case basis. For the purpose of this article, it is assumed that both   and   are automatic selections whose merits do not need to be debated. Neither Stuart McInally nor Fraser Brown have been considered due to their lack of Six Nations game time, although both would have been in contention if it were not for their untimely injuries.  Sutherland has had a meteoric rise since earning a recall to the Scotland setup in 2020. Since then he has established himself as the starting loosehead, delivering a number of impressive performances in the loose and at scrum time. The Edinburgh prop is a powerful carrier and throughout the Six Nations only conceded one scrum penalty in just under 300 minutes of action.  However, there is plenty of competition in his position. After a phenomenal Six Nations, Wyn Jones looks a shoo-in to make the squad. England have a number of talented looseheads in Mako Vunipola, Ellis Genge and Joe Marler - who should not be discounted despite missing the Six Nations. Cian Healy and Dave Kilcoyne are both solid international performers too. Despite not having a huge amount of international experience, Sutherland is in a strong position to make the squad. Against South Africa, as England found out in the World Cup final, strong scrummaging is a must - and Sutherland can provide that. This could give him the edge over Vunipola who has looked vulnerable at the set-piece. Fagerson was in prime position to join Tadhg Furlong and Kyle Sinckler as the third tighthead in the squad before the Six Nations. The Glasgow prop has played a lot of international rugby for someone his age and, after initially flourishing in the loose, Fagerson had shored up his scrummaging. The 25 year-old carries well and is strong in defence - Fagerson did not miss a single tackle during the Six Nations. However, the red card he received against Wales could count against him. Although the sending off was controversial in the eyes of some, the lapse was  and there is no margin for error in the current climate.  Fagerson and Tomas Francis, a Gatland favourite, are likely to be in a straight shootout for the third tighthead spot - although Andrew Porter could also come into the reckoning. Francis played a lot of international rugby under the former Wales coach which could edge it for the Exeter man. The Lions once again have an abundance of talent in the second row to choose from. Maro Itoje, Alun Wyn Jones and James Ryan are all very likely to go if fit. Iain Henderson and Tadhg Beirne both had superb Six Nations campaigns while Courtney Lawes was picked by Gatland in 2017.  It is likely that Gatland will pick four out-and-out locks as well as a player that can cover both second and back row - with player of the tournament nominee Beirne primed for this role. Therefore, despite being a very good player who gets through an incredible amount of work - Gray had the most combined carries, tackles and ruck involvements of any forward in the tournament - he could well be struggling. Gray did not have his best game against Ireland when his Lions rivals stepped up to dominate the lineout which will not help his case. One cannot help but feel Gray will be a victim of talent in his position, just as Joe Launchbury was in 2017. Ritchie rarely fails to perform in a Scotland jersey, combining tenacious defence with impressive scavenging skills at the breakdown. He won four jackal turnovers during the Six Nations, a number only bettered by Henderson and Beirne.  The Edinburgh flanker is certainly in with a shout, but the back row is extremely competitive. Ritchie is a talent who has the attitude of a Gatland player. However, he might not be quite good enough to make the plane this time around when compared to the other options of Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Justin Tipuric, Josh Navidi and compatriot Hamish Watson. To some, it may seem odd to even have Watson as a debate. But that is a reflection of the competition rather than the player. Curry, Underhill, Tipuric and Navidi are just four other flankers that also merit a tour place, although the injury that ruled Underhill out of the Six Nations could cost the Bath flanker a spot. The question for Watson is whether he can impose his unique game against the most physical side in world rugby. His performances throughout the Six Nations suggest the answer is yes. Watson completed all 60 tackles he attempted during the competition, proving his defence is just as strong as his signature Tasmanian Devil-esque running game. Price has had a mixed Six Nations. He has created moments of magic but also made basic errors at times.  Unlike the back row, scrum-half is a position of weakness for the Lions which could yet see Price sneak onto the plane. Concerns remain about his box-kicking, however, which could yet put off Gatland who will need his nine to execute a consistent kicking game. Price’s volume of international game-time over the past few years means he will undoubtedly be in the reckoning.  The Gloucester centre is the outstanding defensive 13 in the Six Nations. On Friday night he managed the world-class Virimi Vakatawa expertly, reaffirming his credentials. Harris reads the game superbly well and has the power to make dominant hits when required. He has come from left-field but is right in contention after Manu Tuilagi’s injury and an indifferent Six Nations for Henry Slade. Garry Ringrose looks set to be first choice at 13 but Harris could well edge out Jonathan Davies, George North or Slade to join him. The ability of Slade to cover numerous positions will undoubtedly make him a useful squad member, however.  Van der Merwe has made an instant impression on the international scene. The physically imposing winger beat 31 defenders in this year’s tournament, surpassing Brian O’Driscoll’s record for the most in a single edition of the Six Nations (30), which he set in 2000. His combination of power, footwork and finishing nous makes him a tempting option for Gatland. However, Van der Merwe also made a number of defensive mistakes in the Six Nations, looks a little shaky under the high ball and is inexperienced at the top level. If wing was an area of weakness for the Lions, Van der Merwe would be a shoo-in. But have his exploits over the last 12 months been impressive enough to displace one of Anthony Watson, Jonny May or Josh Adams?  The Edinburgh star could be directly competing with another wing sensation in Louis Rees-Zammit for the final spot. Van der Merwe would be an exciting pick, but this tour could be too early in his development as an international player.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/basketball/2021/04/01/march-madness-highlights-insanity-ncaa-not-paying-star-attractions/,sport,"The biggest sporting event currently taking place in the United States is a basketball tournament called “March Madness”. The term was first coined in 1939 by a high school official in relation to the excitement generated by the eight-team competition composed of colleges. Over the past 80 plus years, it has grown to a 68-team tournament lasting several weeks. The excitement has kept pace. In 2019, the competition generated roughly $1billion for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) the organising body while $8.5billion is wagered on the results.  But the real mad part. The totally crazy part. The insane part. The athletes, who generate all these billions, do not receive a single dollar for their efforts. In fact, they are banned from receiving any “extra benefit or expense allowance not authorized by the NCAA legislation” which could extend to having a meal off campus or accepting sports clothing from a potential sponsor. This is not just basketball but all American college sports. College football, which is played in some of the biggest stadiums in the world, pulls in around $1.5 billion a year in television rights plus millions more in other forms of revenues. Again the athletes get paid nothing. As former NBA player Chris Paul wrote recently: “Can you imagine what it’s like to generate millions in revenue for your school — without being able to buy a hot meal off campus? Can you imagine what it’s like to be a few months from being able to take care of your family — but knowing that if you twist your leg at the wrong angle, you could lose it all?” All this could be about to change, however. On Wednesday the United States Supreme Court will hear a case brought by Shawn Alston, a former college football player for West Virginia University, which charges the NCAA with breaking anti-trust regulations. Effectively the colleges reap millions of dollars a year by colluding not to pay their athletes. The lower courts have already ruled in Alston’s favour. The NCAA’s traditional argument is that the athletes are receiving a free education through scholarship schemes. However, the education takes a back seat to the student’s athletic pursuits. It is estimated that athletes will spend 40 hours a week training, equivalent to a full-time job.  Unsurprisingly, the graduation rates for student athletes are far lower than for the general student population. Of course, the student athletes can go on to make millions in the NBA or NFL, but it is believed only 4 per cent of students will be drafted. They then must survive their mandatory rookie contract before they can get their big pay day. A severe injury could easily snatch that dream away. Meanwhile, coaches within college sports are paid millions.  The optics are not great. The football and basketball college athletes, who perform the labour, are predominantly black. Those that run the college programmes, who profit from those labours, are overwhelming white. At best, it is hard not to see this as a form of indentured servitude. In this year’s March Madness, athletes have taken to tweeting or displaying the hashtag #NotNCAAproperty. As Geo Baker of the Rutgers Scarlet Knights wrote: “We deserve an opportunity to create money from our name, image, and likeness. If you don't agree with that statement, then you are saying that you believe that I, a human being, should be owned by something else.” The NCAA continues to dig its heels in. Of course, when an industry makes billions of dollars, it is unwilling to give up that profit stream without a fight. Its fallback argument is that if you started paying athletes then it would blur the distinction between college and professional sports, which lead to a mass decline in viewership. This seems tenuous at best. Nor are the NCAA colleges particularly benevolent, far-sighted institutions. Just before March Madness, Oregon Ducks’ player Sedona Prince posted a video, which has been viewed 18 million times, of the difference between the women’s weights room consisting of 12 dumbbells and the men’s weights room, which was full of state of the art equipment.  Indeed, the very adoption of amateurism as a founding principle of NCAA was born of a historical wrong. In 1955 Ray Dennison died of an injury sustained playing American football for Fort Lewis A&M Aggies. When his widow sued for workers’ compensation, the NCAA successfully argued that as he was a student-athlete rather than a worker and therefore compensation should not be paid. Subsequently explicit pledges of amateurism were written into every college sporting contract.  It is high time the Supreme Court righted the wrong of this glaring injustice. ",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/03/31/sport-must-acknowledge-duty-address-issue-violence-against-women/,sport,"Last week, Women's Aid made a statement which went largely under the radar in football. The news was that Bristol City, a club which pledged its support for the domestic abuse charity's Football United campaign, had signed Danny Simpson - a man convicted in 2015 of assaulting his former partner and mother of one of his children. Women's Aid swiftly announced it would be removing City from all materials related to the Football United campaign, expressing its concern that Simpson will ""be a role model for young fans and team-mates"", adding: ""In 2014 Bristol City signed our Football United pledge to say ‘We will send a clear message in our club that violence against women and children is completely unacceptable’, it sadly seems that in 2021 that this is not the case."" When City announced Simpson would be joining the club until the end of the season, the accompanying statement described his football credentials, including five years at Leicester City where he won the Premier League. But in 2015, during that title winning season, Simpson was convicted of assault. During the trial evidence given by police included a description of him ""choking"" his former partner, after police entered his home in December 2014 to find Simpson ""straddling"" her, ""his hands firmly placed around her neck"". His former partner did not support the prosecution, and rescinded her original police statement, but Simpson was sentenced to 300 hours of community service for which he served 145, before a judge agreed that 'press intrusion' made completing his full service impossible, and instead imposed a 21-day curfew. This column is not here to question whether Simpson should or should not play elite football. But the way City sidestepped their new signing's inconvenient history is worth highlighting, as it is something they are not alone in. Players and journalists jostled to congratulate Simpson on Twitter, while news reports described a similar, edited synopsis of his career as City did. It is characteristic of a larger eerie silence across sport, in a month where violence against women has been at the centre of national discourse. While nobody would seek to deprive Simpson of his right to move on from such an incident, and the law allows him to do that, how much better would it have been when violence against women is so much in the public eye, for him and the club to have met that subject head on? When Sarah Everard went missing in Clapham in March, and was later found dead, a women's movement gained pace. The reaction to her tragic death dominated the front pages and social media in a national conversation, but barely a peep was heard from sport's major bodies and personalities. Trust Marcus Rashford to be the exception, tweeting:  Along with Chelsea, who have been applauded this past year for its campaign backing domestic abuse charity Refuge, Rashford's voice stood out because he cut a largely isolated figure in men's sport. Readers might wonder why such a story should have a place in the sports pages. But male perpetrators of violence and harassment do not exist in a vacuum, they are embedded in our culture - including sport. Former Real Madrid player Robinho was signed by three top division sides since his 2017 conviction for sexual assault and involvement in a gang rape - for which he has evaded any jail time due to extradition law. The NFL sparked outrage in 2014, when a video captured Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice dragging his partner from a lift after knocking her unconscious. Rice initially only received a two-game suspension - a smaller penalty than that carried for ball tampering. Beyond the legal convictions, sports culture has demonstrated a disturbing attitude to violence against women in which beating up a woman is apparently something to laugh about. Last year, when domestic abuse cases surged in the middle of lockdown, British boxer   released a video where, in supposed jest, he advised men how to beat up their wives or girlfriends. He was fined £15,000 by the BBBofC after apologising, but served a mere four-month ban. While earlier this month, an image of Jurgen Klopp (which was used without his knowledge or consent) was widely circulated alongside the faces of real-life survivors of domestic abuse, with the caption: ""Beaten at home throughout lockdown."" There has long been evidence to show ""significant rises"" in domestic abuse claims during major international football tournaments where England is involved - including the 2018 World Cup, when 239 domestic abuse calls were made to police on or the day after England fixtures. It is why seeing Simpson take up his spot with City without the club issuing any commitment or acknowledgment of his troubling history makes a mockery of the efforts Women's Aid has made to overturn such links between football and male violence. It undermines the club's support of the charity, and suggests that a footballer's ability to kick a ball is more important than any values City claims to have around respecting the safety of women. It is, quite simply, sports washing at its finest. Both the club and Simpson declined to comment, but  understands City had been in close discussions with Women's Aid ahead of last week's announcement. However it came in the days after former City under-23s player, Alhaji Sesay, was given a 10-year prison sentence for rape and attempted rape after separate attacks on two women - another significant moment the club failed to acknowledge. ""We would hope the club would want to send a clear message on respect, consent and healthy relationships for players,"" Women's Aid's statement said on the matter, adding: ""One of the main ways we can [reduce violence against women] is by not ignoring or minimising violence against women where it happens."" To those who say it is unfair to drag up Simpson's six-year-old conviction after he served his sentence would be ignoring the huge influence football and sport can have on an issue that affects women in all walks of life. How powerful would it be if more men in sport, as a collective, take up the mantle in supporting the other half of the population this once? Women's Aid was right to call out City's empty support - sport as a whole needs to acknowledge its responsibility to stand up and be counted in the conversation around women's safety and male violence.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/03/31/manchester-city-chelsea-man-utd-club-would-best-tactical-fit/,sport,"Not only is Erling Haaland the most wanted striker in the world and a generational talent capable of improving the front line of any Champions League-chasing club, somehow, despite his age and incredible scoring form, he is (relatively) affordable due to the unique workings of his deal with Borussia Dortmund. The Norwegian international has a £68 million transfer release clause which activates in 2022, meaning it is in Dortmund’s interests to sell this summer and maximise their profit on a player who would inevitably leave in the near future anyway.  The likely £100m+ fee that would secure a move eliminates most clubs from the equation but a few sides will already be working out their budgets. The question for Haaland is, where he would best fit in?  Man City dominate matches with an entertaining style of play and are in particular need of a central striker now that Sergio Aguero has announced he will leave at the end of the season. In Pep Guardiola, Haaland would develop under one of the best coaches in the world and could make similar strides to those of Robert Lewandowski, a similarly powerful goal poacher who excelled as the No 9 in Guardiola’s possession-based 4-3-3.  City could certainly do with a presence in the box to give them something different in the final third, and although Haaland’s height and strength should allow him to bully defenders in the box, an area of the game which he can certainly improve upon is heading the ball. Whether a lack of aggression or technique, Haaland often doesn’t appear to attack crosses and high balls with the determination or (dare it be said) confidence required to beat defenders in the air, which helps explain why he has only taken eight headed shots at goal in the Bundesliga this season compared to Lewandowski’s 30. The player radars of both from this season's Champions League make for an interesting comparison: Lewandowski offers more in build-up and link play, as well as doing slightly more defensively (winning headers and making tackles and interceptions etc) - areas we can expect to see an improvement in from Haaland under Guardiola. Everything else about his game, particularly the intensity and desire to win the ball, suits what Guardiola demands of his centre forward.  Most obvious fit As a boyhood fan of Leeds, the city of his birth and another club his father Alfe Inge played for, a move to rivals United might go against Haaland's football loyalties were it not for the presence of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who worked with him at Molde.   United’s fast transition, counter-attacking style of play would suit Haaland’s movement and pace perfectly, able to lead the line and dart across the box like Edinson Cavani, but also to break and run directly at centre-backs like Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. Bruno Fernandes' tendency to shoot from long range can often result in goalkeepers parrying the ball into the path of an onrushing striker like Haaland. He offers a much more penetrative threat than Martial, as seen here: If you enter Rashford or Cavani into the search box above, you will see that Haaland's numbers make him really stand out as the kind of striker United would benefit from. Solskjaer’s fluid 4-2-3-1 would be much more dangerous with a genuine goal threat taking the chances created during the attacking moves they already perform so well. United are already the second-top scorers in the league without a consistent, clinical finisher.  Suits the style of football. Also a career path to Real Madrid There are few guarantees in football, but one Haaland might consider when evaluating a move to Chelsea is that he will almost certainly work under a few different managers at Stamford Bridge were he to move there. For now it's Thomas Tuchel, who likes to keep possession and press high but his Chelsea team hasn’t been prolific. That is both a problem for the manager and one that Haaland could benefit from. There is competition in Tammy Abraham, who hasn't shown enough in his game to cement first choice as No 9, Olivier Giroud (likely to leave), and the yet-to-adapt Timo Werner, but Haaland would instantly improve Chelsea and play every week. Chelsea would not have expected Werner's attacking contribution to be so small compared to a forward like Haaland: With the choice of any club in the world, the traditional insecurity of the manager’s position and his ties to the two Manchester clubs makes a move to London feel unlikely.   No Real Madrid aren’t exactly rolling in money at the moment but tend to find a way to secure the very best talent and are a club few players could, and would, turn down. One concern might be how badly Luka Jovic struggled to adapt to the demands of the club after signing, having lit up the Bundesliga before moving to Spain. He is now back on loan at Frankfurt with a record of two goals in 21 La Liga appearances. Even the best players can feel the weight of pressure at the Bernebeu. Another even more important issue is the transitional state of the team. Sergio Ramos, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Karim Benzema are all on the verge of retiring or leaving and at 20 years old, Haaland may be better placed to wait to join the world’s biggest club when it's in a better state. He is also a completely different sort of player to Benzema and the team would need to play differently as a result. Through-balls and crosses would become key, with Haaland more likely to run onto a pass and finish than Benzema, who is better able to float in and out of attacking moves to link with others.  Not the best career move right now PSG could offer Haaland all the money he could eat and oil he could drink as well as the near-guaranteed possibility of multiple trophy wins. Except for the odd surprise cup upset, PSG win almost every game domestically and are getting closer to achieving their ultimate ambition of a Champions League win too. Haaland would be well paid and able to score ridiculous amounts of goals in Ligue 1 in a terrifyingly-talented front three, but the prestige of, or simply Haaland’s interest in, French football will likely be a deciding factor.  That said, the opportunity to play alongside Neymar and Kylian Mbappe could be tempting.  Very wealthy stepping stone Makes the most logistical sense of all the moves as a step up to a bigger club in the same league from where he can make another transfer within 3-5 years having secured Bundesliga titles and legitimately competed for the Champions League. Whether Bayern have the funds, particularly after the financial difficulties caused by the pandemic, is another matter. Additionally, Lewandowski has scored 35 goals in 25 league games this season and doesn't exactly need to be replaced any time soon. At 32 years old he may even be at his peak, meaning Haaland would be in direct competition with a player already his superior.  Finances and Lewandowski prevent it being a good move",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/03/31/england-vs-poland-player-ratings-harry-kane-phil-foden-impress/,sport,"England almost dropped their first points of their World Cup qualifying campaign as they were pegged back by Poland at Wembley. But with the clock ticking towards 90 minutes, Harry Maguire proved to be the hero with a clinical shot from a corner.   kept a close eye on the match and ran the rule over Gareth Southgate's men. He has played in three qualifiers but has not been given much of a chance to impress. No saves to make in the first half and no chance with the equaliser.  Showed energy to get up and down the right flank and support attacks, while never looking troubled on his flank when Polish players ran at him. Had so much time on the ball but got dispossessed on his own 18-yard line and Poland were given a way back into the match. Set up the winner to redeem himself. Would have been happy that Robert Lewandowski was ruled out through injury. Carried the ball forward as England tried to chase a winner and volleyed in the deciding goal. Tidy defending, linked up well with Mason Mount and got a good cross over that Phil Foden almost scored from. Confidence-boosting selection with Luke Shaw’s excellent form recently.  Played a little further forward than his position with Leeds. He got around the pitch and took a knock to his ankle. Carried the ball forward well and showed excellent positional discipline. He was always positive with his passing rather than playing backwards. Happy to drop from his advanced position and get involved in play and was always a goal threat with his runs into the penalty area. Raced through and had effort saved.  Passed fit after missing training on eve of match and showed nice touches, knitted together the midfield and forwards with his smart passing. Sensed he had the beating of his full-back and kept running at him until he won a penalty. Guilty of being wasteful but carried the ball well. Tucked away his penalty with confidence and also had a decent drive saved by Wojciech Szczesny at the near post. Would have wanted better service but tireless work and was in dangerous positions.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2021/03/31/tennis-stars-vaccine-response-selfish-blinkered-damaging-sport/,sport,"For the last 12 months, tennis has emitted a low grumbling sound, like a diesel engine idling at the lights. Listen closely, and you can hear dozens of fit young athletes grousing about the misery of the pandemic: the cancelled tournaments, the reduced prize money, and above all the quarantines. Should we have sympathy for their plight, or should we pull out our imaginary violins? Well, it’s true that tennis has suffered more than any other major sport, because it is uniquely global – far more so than golf, for instance – and thus dependent on international travel. But then the players go and remind us how out of touch, and how monumentally selfish, many of them actually are. The latest instance came this week in Miami, where the enterprising  reporter Ben Rothenberg asked half-a-dozen press-conference guinea pigs whether they were planning to be vaccinated. He encountered a wall of scepticism. Not everyone is against. World No 2 Naomi Osaka said “I’m planning on getting one … whenever I’m eligible.” But Andrey Rublev and Elina Svitolina both stressed that there was no advantage to them in having a jab, as it wouldn’t save them from future bio-bubbles and quarantines. Meanwhile Aryna Sabalenka spouted some mumbo-jumbo about damage to the genetic code. Finally, Diego Schwartzman said “It's not a tradition in my family to get any vaccine” before later backtracking and blaming his English for any misunderstanding. The first thing to say here is that athletes are uniquely paranoid about what they put in their bodies. Indeed, they are taught to be that way by the World Anti-Doping Agency. So at a time when Germany has   over blood clot fears, one can forgive them for feeling twitchy. But then you look at their answers again, and blood clots make no appearance. The first two negatives cited a lack of personal advantage. This misses the fact that – for the young and healthy – vaccinations are not supposed to be about you. They are about the vulnerable people you could unintentionally infect. You can see the personal logic here. For the likes of Rublev and Svitolina, stepping off the tour to get a jab will lead to lost training days and travel issues. From a pragmatic perspective, the experience of actually contracting the virus is likely to be so trivial that they would be better off picking it up on the road. What this position ignores is that infection makes them a danger to public health. And then there is Sabalenka, who said “There is the two [vaccines], and I want to make the one I think is more expensive and the one is not going to your genetic stuff.” This sounds like a half-baked theory found on the internet. It thus fits in with the pattern of   since he became tennis’s first vaccine sceptic just under a year ago. We could point to a different kind of contagion here; that of bogus, pseudo-scientific ideas. Tennis once again finds itself uniquely vulnerable, to misinformation this time. The players are headstrong young athletes who run their own mini-team of coaches, physios and fitness trainers. It’s hard for their support staff to guide them when they make all the money and call all the shots. Yes, you could say the same about golfers. But tennis players tend to leave school earlier, often before puberty, and thus complete very little formal education. Rothenberg’s questions prompted enough debate around the world for both tours to issue a statement. The Women’s Tennis Association said that they were not interested in interfering because “this is a personal decision we respect.” The men’s tour are talking to “consultants in infectious disease and virology”. Sooner or later, one expects that a big event – perhaps it could be next year’s Australian Open – will make vaccinations essential, and thus nudge the player base into complying for their own selfish reasons. For the moment, though, many members of the locker-room are coming across as narcissistic and blinkered. The one person who has judged the public mood from the beginning is Rafael Nadal. In Melbourne, for instance, he undercut the chorus of outrage at two-week lockdowns by saying “You see how many people are losing their father, their mums, without having the chance to say goodbye … When you see all of this, you have to stay a little bit more positive.” Nadal is a  , someone who sees family and community as the most important values. You might remember him helping to clean up his home island of Majorca after deadly floods swept the capital a couple of years ago. His peers have less life experience, for many have spent their entire lives in another sort of bubble: that provided by their agent, coach and trainer. Even so, they have had a year to consider the implications of the pandemic. And now they have switched from bemoaning their personal suffering to denigrating the only solution. There is something curiously childlike in this contradiction.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/01/germany-laughing-stock-world-football-enjoy-lasts/,sport,"There is only one appropriate response to the news that   in a World Cup qualifier: to point out it was a good job they weren’t playing the whole of Macedonia.  Sure, it is not the most original of gags, first employed when the Welsh rugby team lost a World Cup game against Western Samoa in 1991. But that shouldn’t hold us back. Not when it is Germany involved — and particularly when history suggests this is a blip rather than a long-term slump.  This, after all, is the nation that routinely roasts minnows, the country that has won the World Cup no less than four times. Here’s how certain and secure their progress normally is: until yesterday’s defeat, they hadn’t lost a qualification match at home in 20 years, when they were beaten 5-1 by England in 2001, a result that we in this country have politely tried not to mention too often since.  And here they were — for 90 minutes at least — proving to be as flawed as the rest of us. To add to the comedy, the Macedonians’ opening goal was scored by the oldest man ever to find the net against them, 37-year-old Goran Pandev. What’s more this was promoted before kick-off as the final, triumphal home game to be overseen by the Germans’ long-serving, World Cup-winning coach, the trouser-rummaging Joachim Low. It is not a result to be sniffed at. Some might suggest it is a little rich to mock. Particularly if you are English and have seen your side humiliated by Iceland in Nice or be hammered by, well, Germany in Bloemfontein. But if anyone will understand the urge to titter at another’s misfortune it is the Germans. After all, their language accommodates the perfect term for the moment, a phrase so exact in its meaning it is impossible to translate. And Schadenfreude is a key element of a tribal football fan’s existence: sniggering when your rivals falter is as satisfying as celebrating your own team’s success. Just ask anyone in Scotland how they felt when England slumped to Croatia in the 2018 World Cup semi-final. The saltires were flying that night.  We on this side of the Channel don’t often get the opportunity to laugh at the Germans. For them making their way to the finals of a football competition is usually the most serene and easy of processes. So we should seize the rare chance to make merry about the fact the most coveted and highly paid bunch of players in Europe fell down against the latest incarnation of the long, drawn-out breakdown of Yugoslavia. Sure, North Macedonia are no fools and can field players of the calibre of Ezgjan Alioski of Leeds United. But a side featuring the likes of Ilkay Gundogan, Timo Werner and Leroy Sane were expected to swipe them aside with the minimum of fuss.  That they didn’t can only be greeted with delight by those of us who like to think we are their rivals. Particularly in a World Cup qualification process designed principally to ensure the progress of the big nations and their television audiences. Meaning has been almost completely extracted from a system in which the top sides are protected and qualification turned into one long procession of certainty.  Not any more. The North Macedonians saw to that. Except, being football fans, our instinct is not to praise their achievement so much as to smirk at German incompetence. Watching Werner miss the kind of sitter that would give a weekend park player palpitations, or reading the Group J table and seeing them in third place adds a wholly unexpected spice to competition. It is almost as if Low and his team hail from a country that couldn’t organise a roll-out in a vaccination centre.  So laugh loud and long. Particularly as, when it comes to Germany, such opportunities do not linger long. Their response to set-back tends to be short, sharp and productive. Only the foolish would suggest this is a result likely to do anything other than spark an insistent revival; the wise have probably already placed a bet on them triumphing in Qatar next winter.  After all, the last time they faltered at home in qualification, they went on to reach the final of the 2002 World Cup. England — their conquerors in Munich on that glorious night in 2001 — lost in the quarter-finals. Their previous home qualifying defeat — to Portugal in 1985 — prefaced the exact same scenario, with Die Mannschaft eventually being edged out in the 1986 World Cup final by Argentina, who had beaten England in the last eight thanks to Diego Maradona's brilliant feet and wandering hands. Which was nothing to laugh at all. Unless you happen to be Scottish, obviously. ",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/01/kalvin-phillips-proves-just-able-jordan-henderson-deputy-england/,sport,"It is no mean feat to be quietly effective in a team whose every move is dissected, analysed and reanalysed, but Kalvin Phillips has been just that in England’s first three games of World Cup qualifying. And Phillips, who – ahead of the latest triple-header – might have still worried for his place if Jordan Henderson recovers from injury in time for the summer, can now be confident that he is a certainty for Gareth Southgate’s squad for the European Championships. Mason Mount, Phil Foden and Declan Rice are the midfielders who have grabbed most of the headlines over the past week, but Phillips has made his own impact and is clearly valued highly by Southgate. Leeds United supporters may have had mixed feelings over seeing Phillips start all three of England’s three qualifiers, but they will be proud at the way the 25-year-old carried himself. And when the real test came in the form of Poland at Wembley,  by completing 100 per cent of his first-half passes, 26 from 26, in another encouraging performance. It was from his corner that Harry Maguire eventually smashed England’s winner. Phillips did not look like a player who was making only his seventh England appearance and it has been striking how comfortably he has settled into the squad, having first been called up before he had played in the Premier League. “He’s adapted really well” said Southgate. “He’s a fantastic character to have around, a fantastic athlete and he uses the ball really well.” It is testament to how impressed Southgate has been with Phillips that he reverted to a back four for all three qualifiers, resisting the temptation to bring in a third central defender for the greater threat offered by Poland. Henderson’s potential absence for the Euros looked like a huge blow and Southgate will still be keen to have him available against Croatia on June 13. But if Henderson does not make it or is not quite fit enough for the early games, then Southgate knows that, in Phillips, he appears to have found the right man to step in. That in itself may be doing the Leeds star a disservice, as he has proved himself to be far more than an able deputy. While Mount and Foden catch the eye with their ability to create and score goals, and Rice is in many ways the intelligent muscle in front of the back four, Phillips can help build attacks with his range of passing, making himself available to the defenders and pushing forwards to support the attacking players. He is also savvy enough to smell danger. The social media trolls who have been forced to find a new target by Mount’s superb form have tried to turn their attention towards Phillips, using his inclusion as another way of trying to accuse Southgate of being negative. That may be largely down to club rivalries, but one senses that Phillips, in probably a more understated manner, will eventually send his online detractors packing in much the same way Mount has done. In terms of England, only one opinion needs to matter to Phillips. And, in Southgate, he has earned himself a big fan.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/03/31/john-stones-recovers-england-gaffe-will-true-test-character/,sport,"The narrative of John Stones’ reinvention has been a seductive one this season. There is his golden form at Manchester City, his thriving double act with Ruben Dias in central defence, his hopes of sealing a fresh contract with the champions-in-waiting. But then,  , his stock fell faster than Deliveroo’s share price. Where England’s favourite takeaway service suffered a 30 per cent wipe-out in value on its first day as a listed company, its once flavour-of-the-month centre-back risked a similar collapse in worth in Gareth Southgate’s eyes, as his reputation for brittleness returned. Ultimately, the damage was mitigated by Harry Maguire’s late winner, but the horror of a single absent-minded error will haunt Stones’ thoughts for weeks. His dawdling on the ball gifted a touch to Arkadiusz Milik, and within seconds Brighton’s Jakub Moder completed the punishment with a rifled finish beyond Nick Pope. Even if there were no supporters in attendance to barrack him, a crestfallen Stones still looked as if he wanted the Wembley pitch to swallow him whole. It was his first such blunder in seven weeks, but with England’s next engagement on this stage a Euro 2020 group game against Croatia in 74 days’ time, the timing was heavy with misfortune. Stones was supposed to have left brain-fades such as this far behind. Granted, there had been ample support for his ‘Calamity John’ reputation: an absurd back-pass across his own penalty area for City in October 2016, a horrible miscue to allow Roberto Firmino to score for Liverpool in January 2018. He had been culpable on the international stage, too, slipping at a fateful moment against Holland in 2019. All this had become a distant memory, thanks to his renaissance under Pep Guardiola. At 26, his sheer consistency in defence played a vital role in City’s , with the manager understood to be keen to extend his contract beyond 2022. His improvements appeared a testament to how honest graft could turn around a once-faltering career. But then a fleeting lapse for his country brought back an unwelcome caricature. It was for his gaffe-prone tendency that Guardiola used to look askance at Stones. Any player prone to slips in possession had no part in his quest for perfection. But by degrees, Stones won over even his most committed detractors. All the entries in his reel of lowlights, from an under-hit backpass to Tim Howard while he was still in Everton colours to a poorly-aimed clearance that let in Daniel Sturridge to score for Liverpool in a Mersey derby rout, were consigned to history. Then came this stumble against Poland, and the question of whether he could be trusted for the grandest occasions resurfaced. By the end, Stones had achieved some measure of atonement, cushioning a header across to Maguire for the winner. “He has made a mistake, and he knows that,” Southgate said. “But he has bounced back.” The head coach is not the impetuous type, and he is unlikely to countenance any drastic action on Stones, with England safely en route to qualifying for the Qatar World Cup. But inescapably, a shadow of doubt will linger. Come June, Southgate needs to have banished any last nagging concerns, settling on a starting line-up who can lift a restless country. Is Stones a player who can produce when it matters most? There is no question that the pressure on England increases vastly from here. When they next emerge from the Wembley tunnel, Southgate’s England team hope, like all of us, to inhabit a demonstrably different world. For all that they have grown inured to keeping the show rolling on through this tumbleweed period for the national game, they are soon to be the headline stars of a summer of love that will, to judge by this week’s lockdown-loosening revelries, make Woodstock look like a tea party. Kane, while he embodied composure in lashing home his penalty against Poland, is about to discover how it felt being Paul Gascoigne 25 years ago. Everywhere, you can sense the pent-up Euro 96 energies just waiting to be unleashed. Even Sir Keir Starmer, whose greatest sporting claim to fame is as a “midfield general” for his eight-a-side team at his local Kentish Town sports centre, has not resisted leaping aboard the nostalgia train, choosing “Three Lions” as his first track on Radio Four’s  Rocking has been conspicuous by its absence at Wembley of late, as indeed has jumping, cheering, even unrestricted breathing. To imagine that all this can be reimagined in 2½ months as a fan-friendly citadel is a stretch. This, though, remains the intention. Against Croatia, there will be legal permission for at least 10,000 to attend, with all restrictions on social contact due to be wound down eight days later. It is an occasion to which England need to rise, after being granted a major reprieve by Poland. Stones, likewise, must adapt, and fast. For his club, he has successfully mastered his fragilities. But for his country, there is still the suspicion he is an accident waiting to happen.  John Stones has an age to turn and play forward when he receives the ball from Nick Pope.  But instead of going forward the Manchester City defender turns back towards goal when closed down by Moder  Under pressure Stones miscontrols the ball and only succeeds in stabbing it inside to the grateful Milik.   Stones goes to close him down but the crafty Milik slips it through his legs to Moder.   Brighton's Moder opens his body on the left of the box and bludgeons a shot past Pope, who has little chance to stop it.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/01/harry-kane-has-except-trophies-does-need/,sport,"The key question for Harry Kane is: what next? Once more the Tottenham Hotspur striker has proved his excellence and, arguably, he can lay claim to being not only the best centre-forward in the Premier League but also its most effective play-maker. His eye for a pass, and weight of pass, is as effective as his finishing and it is remarkable just how much Tottenham are dependent upon him. If only Kane could pass to Kane. Which leads to that question of what next?   – although they will have to overcome Manchester City in the League Cup Final to do so. And even then is winning the fourth most important competition, from the four that Spurs entered, going to be enough to keep Kane happy? The short answer is he may have little choice. There are three more years on his contract after this season, he turns 28 in July, and that is before even thinking about whether a club would come close to the by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy. Or want to negotiate with Levy in the first place. There is little doubt Kane, given his ambition, given his ability, would consider a change and it has been on his mind for more than two years now but there is another factor:   this summer when transfers will undoubtedly still be affected by the coronavirus pandemic? Clubs want him but can they do it? One thing is for sure – Kane will not allow the speculation to affect him. He is one of the most dedicated and single-minded footballers and has worked tirelessly to maximise his ability for club and country even if, at times, his frustration is not only inevitable but obvious. Kane may well surpass not only Wayne Rooney’s record as England’s leading goalscorer  . But how will that feel if he does not win trophies? Shearer could have won far more if he had joined Manchester United instead of Newcastle United but, at least, by then he was already a Premier League winner with Blackburn Rovers. For Kane there may also be the nightmare scenario of another season outside of the Champions League – having lost in the final two years ago – should Spurs finish outside the top four once again. It is not where elite players want to be. The questions and the debate will continue but Kane should be celebrated, also, for what he is and that is an extraordinarily accomplished forward who has – as all the best players do – continually adapted and added to his game. Interestingly he always out-performs his ‘xG’ – expected goals – one of the favoured metrics used by analysts. It means he scores more than he should. Kane has 27 goals and 16 assists in 40 games so far this season for Spurs, which equates to more than one goal involvement a game, and his link-up with Son Heung-min . And yet Spurs are only sixth in the league and out of Europe. It does raise one more question: what he would achieve in a team that is truly challenging for honours?",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/01/future-transfer-market-swap-deals-feeder-clubs-reward-brains/,sport,"A combination of factors – Brexit, the coronavirus-induced financial issues – have led to changing the way that football clubs at the very top of the game do business. Here, Jason Burt examines the significant ways and how it will effect clubs and players.  “In a healthy market, the natural instinct for a club is to prevent players from going inside their last year of contract,” says leading agent Alan Redmond, the head of football at , the company founded by rapper Jay-Z, and whose clients include Marcus Rashford, Kevin De Bruyne, Romelu Lukaku and Wilfried Zaha. ""It maintains the rights of the club to sell the player, rather than lose him for free or for a greatly reduced fee.” However, that has changed with clubs dealing with the loss of income due to Covid and considering how best to manage their squads. It means there may be far more free agents and – therefore – free transfers in the summer, including some high-profile ones. , Bayern Munich's David Alaba and Jerome Boateng and Paris Saint-Germain's Julian Draxler are all free agents in the summer, while some Premier League clubs have swathes of their squads out of contract. Crystal Palace, for one, have 11 in that position come June 30. “The question that a lot of clubs will have now regarding players inside their last year of contract is: ‘does the wage cost of renewing the player for another three years outweigh the risk of not being able to sell him and the financial implications of being saddled with him for an extended period?’” Redmond says. “Clubs will ask themselves if they could use the funds to bring fresh faces, rather than go through the motions of renewing a player of questionable re-sale value. Fans of clubs with multiple players on soon-to-expire contracts may normally question the management of their club. In the specific case of the summer 2021 transfer window, your club may be wise in this respect.” One continuing advantage that Premier League clubs have over the rest of Europe is the strength of the broadcast deals. Europe envies the spending power in England which, Redmond says, provides the “opportunity of a swifter financial recovery even if that means it just enables them to borrow more easily than European clubs with the same empty stadiums but vastly inferior TV deals”. In the first instance that should make it easier for   despite the UK having left the European Union – although they will have to navigate the ‘points-based’ system which has been introduced. If players are to be signed they have to meet a set of criteria based on such measures as international appearances, which league the selling club is in and how many competitive games they have played. “The challenge facing Premier League clubs is to work through the ‘points-based system’ and figure out who the hell they can actually sign?” Redmond says. But this also does provide an opportunity. “In the way that clubs like   of their competitors in terms of data analysis and the transfer market, Premier League clubs who adapt to the new system fastest can steal a march on other clubs,” Redmond explains. “I think there are some clubs who have reacted sharply and are attacking the situation with an intelligent approach, as others are still yawning while putting their pants on. At Roc Nation, we represent a non-EU player who has played once for his national team. In January, we calculated the points to see if he met the 15-point barrier to play in England. He actually gets 28 points, almost double the requirement. Meeting the requirement to play in the UK adds to the player’s value. This is a time for brains in player recruitment, more than ever.” The idea of so-called ‘feeder clubs’, where players can be developed or sent on loan, is not new. Chelsea have long cultivated relationships with clubs such as Vitesse Arnhem to develop players through loan deals, while Manchester City have used their network of clubs around the world to blood their younger talents.  Redmond believes that more Premier League clubs will look to develop this route. “There is a chance that an increasing number of Premier League owners will acquire an additional European club,” he says. “One of the many possible advantages of this could be to sign players who fall below the points threshold in the UK, in the same way that prior to Brexit, it was a method of signing non-EU players in territories with less stringent visa regulations. “The issue with feeder clubs is that they are often small clubs in small markets. Players transferred to them may struggle to meet the criteria to play in England, even after two strong seasons. However, there’s nothing preventing these players from being sold into other countries at a profit. Additionally, feeder clubs are often used as loan destinations for young, not first team-ready, players signed to the mother club.” However the system is not without controversy and does not always work, if there is not a coherent plan or style of play. “This hodge-podge of crossed purposes often stomps on the identity of the feeder club itself, as the coach is left to select his starting XI from a combination of home-grown players, nomadic players bought for investment, and shoe-horned loans from the mother club that they’re under pressure to play,"" Redmond says. ""And this is all while trying to stay rooted to the footballing philosophy being force-fed by the club at the top of the hierarchy. Some clubs will get it right. A lot won’t.” Redmond is confident that optimism is finally beginning to return, with a few caveats. “The   but this wasn’t a surprise to anyone,” he says. “In the summer of 2020, there was a sense that fans would be back in stadiums by the end of the year, even if it was in reduced numbers, and that we would come into 2021 with attendances being increased further. “The January window was always likely to be restrained but when it became apparent that fans wouldn't be returning imminently, there was a quiet acceptance within the game that while televised football was playing an important role for millions of locked-down people, nobody was likely to spend until there were more concrete signs of recovery. “Everyone is afraid to jump the gun and presume that we’re over the worst but that is the supposition that is forming the consensus within football and fuelling talks for the summer window.  With the positivity around vaccinations being rolled out, the reality of contracts expiring and, dare we say it, fans returning, I can see an active summer window.” The nature of a number of transfers will change, Redmond argues, with clubs thinking more creatively about how they can get deals done – with the fees paid coming down.  “Just as Neymar’s world record (€222 million) transfer to PSG partially reset transfer fees at the top end, and contributed to prices like those paid for Philippe Coutinho and Antoine Griezmann, the effects of Covid sent things back in the opposite direction more profoundly,” he explains. “I would still anticipate some big transfers in the summer, as well as some substantial deals that involve part-exchange. A player who was valued, pre-Covid, at £50 million, may not go for £50 million this summer. He may, however, go for £30 million plus a player worth £8-12 million in the opposite direction. Again, exchange deals are nothing new but I can see them being advantageous for both clubs in a transaction in this specific summer window.”",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2021/04/01/trio-should-play-behind-harry-kane-euro-2021-bad-news-marcus/,sport,"Two years ago, Gareth Southgate explained the absence of James Maddison from the England squad by saying that the team “had not been playing with a No 10”. The world has changed since then and so have England, for whom the main development of these past few games has been the emergence of not one, but two No 10s in Southgate’s starting lineup.  and Poland, England’s attack was far more fluid than we have come to expect. Out went the rigidity that was caused by a back three and in came a flexibility in the final third, where Mason Mount and Phil Foden were given the freedom to seek space and play between the lines. For the first 45 minutes  , England looked to be playing a genuinely modern and progressive form of attacking football. Foden drifted inside from the right, combining with his team-mates and helping England to outnumber the visiting midfield, while Kyle Walker provided the width on the flank he had vacated. It was an approach built on movement, intelligence and technical quality in the attacking midfield positions. Which, in short, are all the things that England have been routinely accused of lacking in recent years. There was none of this against Croatia in the World Cup semi-final of 2018, for example, when Luka Modric’s most devastating act was to remind an entire nation that they did not have a Luka Modric. Mount and Foden are not at that level, although they might be one day. They certainly play that sort of football, though: roaming, scheming, controlling the tempo and dragging opposition players into the places they do not want to go.  Completing the trident behind Harry Kane was Raheem Sterling, whose role is to stretch teams with his pace rather than drift around with Mount and Foden. Together they have made for an appealing trio in these last two matches, when there has been an exciting balance to England’s attacking play at times. Their first goal against Poland, eventually finished from the penalty spot by Kane, was a fine example of the Foden/Mount/Sterling triumvirate in action. Foden had floated over from his starting position on the right, as he did throughout the first half, to create a tight triangle with Mount and Sterling: The ball was lost, but Foden’s proximity to the action allowed him to win it back and prod a pass into Sterling. From there, the Manchester City winger embarked on the run which earned the penalty.  At the moment Sterling received the ball, both Mount and Foden were within just a couple of yards of him. Such a scenario would be far less likely with a player like Marcus Rashford or Jadon Sancho on the right flank.  , a player who generally wants to come to the ball in the middle of the pitch rather than wait for it on the wing. This could be seen again a few minutes after the opener, when Foden once again darted inside to create a shooting chance for Kane. Mount and Sterling had combined down the left, before the Chelsea midfielder whipped a pass into the path of Foden. Kane seized on Foden’s flick, and almost doubled the lead: In these early stages, when the plan was working, Mount and Foden had the protection of Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips behind them. Together, they sometimes created what is referred to as a “box” in midfield. Rice and Phillips formed the deeper half of the square, with Mount and Foden playing directly in front of them. It meant England had depth, allowing them to smoothly play their way into the final third. Based on the events of the last week, this shape is the grand vision in Southgate’s mind. Replace Kalvin Phillips with Jordan Henderson, and it could easily be the midfield quartet of choice in the summer.  In such a scenario, it would not be unreasonable to suggest that Sterling, Rashford, Sancho and Jack Grealish are all competing for one place on the left wing. If Foden is the big winner of this international break, as the only player of his type on the right side, then those three surely must be seen as the biggest losers. All this is not to say that Southgate has cracked it. Far from it. The first half against Poland was promising, yes, but the second half was poor. The midfield began to soften, with Phillips and Rice coming under more pressure, and as a result Mount and Foden became less influential.  The opening 45 minutes was proof that England have an exciting plan, then, but the rest of the match showed they are not yet capable of executing it for a full 90 minutes. Southgate’s reluctance to make any changes until the 86th minute, when he replaced Foden with Reece James, was puzzling in the extreme. If this system, with Foden and Mount operating as two unconventional No 10s, is to be the Plan A, then one suspects that England will probably need a Plan B soon enough. For now, though, the optimists can seize upon the fluidity of their first-half showing as proof of this young team’s evolution into a more imaginative and flexible side. After all, it is not so long ago that Southgate’s England did not have any creative playmakers at all. With Foden and Mount, they now have two.",1

There are three games where we could see 100 points and almost all eight are too close to call. I have predicted just one English team to go through, but it is not beyond the realms of possibility for all five to progress – or even zero. Of my eight selections, I would put money on three, the rest I would just be enjoying. After the impact of Covid and the worry of restrictions and cancellations, the sooner the tournament arrived at the knockouts the better. The need to finish the tournament and crown a European champion meant sacrificing the group stages and bailing on them as quickly as possible. That was a move of which  ; in the pool stage they played two, lost two, finished with a negative points difference and yet find themselves travelling to South Wales on Sunday in a European knockout match. There is nothing like knockout rugby – and we, the viewers, will benefit most. I love jeopardy! I watched the Pro14 final against Munster last Saturday which Leinster won 16-6, but it could have been 66-6. Munster know how to stay in a game, which is a valuable quality, but Leinster were unbelievable, playing with frightening pace and tempo. , centre Robbie Henshaw looks as if he is playing against 16-year-olds. The only negative you can aim at Leinster is a lack of ruthlessness given how many sights on goal they crafted. Toulon battered Sale at home and have rockstars like lock Eben Etzebeth throughout, but missing wing Gabin Villière is massive. He is so good; in fact, if he were playing I might have altered my prediction. Without him, they have no chance.  Leinster to win - easily La Rochelle are unlucky that they have played two and ‘won’ two and still have to go away from home, but they are victims of the proliferation of French teams left in the competition. Had this match been in France, I wouldn’t have given Gloucester a hope. However, if my auntie had proverbials she would be my uncle; at home, Gloucester have enough mercurial talent to upset the French aristocrats. But this La Rochelle team are formidable. English rugby viewers are aware of Will Skelton's potency and I’m such a fan of  . They have an amazing back-line but, as in 2018 when they reached their only quarter-final to date, their ability to close out matches, particularly with their goal-kicking, is a worry. But they are a European giant awaiting a wake-up, a real guilty pleasure. La Rochelle Wasps have lost five on the trot at home and, in that position, Clermont might be the last team they’d like to see rock up in Coventry. The French side beat Bristol away and were 21-0 up at one stage, but conversely they threw away a 28-16 lead to Munster at home. Regardless of the victor, this could almost be a rerun of Liverpool vs Newcastle in the Kevin Keegan era. Only one team scored more points than Clermont in the pool stages, but only one team conceded more points, too. This could be 75-70! Wasps have a few missing but they will take heart from that pool-stage win against Montpellier. But this is a competition in which Clermont have underachieved for years. They will not underestimate Wasps and, with that Penaud-Raka-Matsushima back three, it might not matter even if they do. Clermont What an advert for the competition to get matches of this quality in the last-16 stage. Munster have shown characteristic resilience lately, against Leinster and in Clermont – with Peter O’Mahony the catalyst, as ever – and they are at home. But they will need to be at their European best. Toulouse will arrive almost with a World XV. The French giants have the Six Nations’ best player,  , and look back to their self-confident best, having been missing in Europe for too long. But even a silent Thomond Park is worth 10 points. Most will think I’m nuts, but Munster will want to do it  . It breaks my heart to snub Toulouse's magnificence but backing Munster at home has similarities with Phil Taylor in the darts or Desert Orchid in the King George - it always feels a safe bet.  Munster, but it will be tight If Sale are the luckiest team in the competition, then Lyon are the unluckiest. Unbeaten so far, putting Gloucester through the mincer in the pool stages, their reward is a trip to the champions who themselves finished seventh in their pool. The casual viewer might think that this is a done deal for Exeter, at home against a team of little European repute. But Lyon are the Top 14’s form team; they have won their last three matches, with Toulon and Toulouse among them. Exeter   and if Lyon fly out of the blocks on Saturday to expose any hint of rustiness then it could be a tough afternoon. The Chiefs have not been at their fluid best this season – but they are a big-game team.  Exeter Edinburgh simply have nothing to lose and, when you add in some of Richard Cockerill’s mongrel, that makes for a dangerous underdog. This could be uncomfortable for Racing, who will be without banned fly-half Finn Russell. They will want it to be finished after 50 minutes so they can slope off for a glass of fizz. Edinburgh will have to piggy-back the Scottish heroics of last weekend if they are to replicate the result in the same city. No 8 Nick Haining was fabulous against France, so too  . For those  , too, this could be their last high-pressure match to stake their claim.  Racing 92 A lot of this will depend on the fitness of Matthieu Jalibert, the Bordeaux fly-half who missed France’s final Six Nations match due to concussion. If he plays, alongside wing Santiago Cordero, then that duo can rip anyone – even Bristol – to shreds. But the Bears have shred-ripping players of their own, too. Semi Radradra and Charles Piutau among others might have something to say about my verdict, but what is more certain is that this could be another 100-pointer. Bristol don’t know how to kick – and it seems to be working. But Bordeaux have Europe's best support lines and the Bears, for all their attacking glamour, must concentrate on stopping Bordeaux’s offloading. A team beginning with B will win this game – I’m sure. If Bristol do win, with a home quarter-final to come, they almost become tournament favourites. But it’s some challenge – Bordeaux seldom lose at home.  Bordeaux to nick it The organisers will be hoping that Scarlets do them a favour and put Sale away. As much as I would love Alex Sanderson’s side to lift the trophy after not winning a pool game, it would not be the greatest look for the competition. Might Sanderson have one eye on the Premiership top four and, after a lucky qualification, treat this as a shot to nothing? If Sale travel to Wales locked and loaded, if Faf de Klerk and Lood de Jager play and Akker van der Merwe nails his lineouts, then they have a sniff. But Scarlets had an amazing win at Bath playing stylish rugby, and a lot of their lads will be high on confidence after Wales’ Six Nations win.  Scarlets",2
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2021/04/01/resurgent-mel-reid-ready-make-history-female-masters/,sport,"The first major of the season begins on Wednesday, with Mel Reid labelling the Ana Inspiration as “the female Masters” and declaring that she has never felt more  .  finished seventh at this £2.25 million showpiece last September, her best finish at Palm Springs in seven appearances. It was a turnaround in form for the Englishwoman then ranked 108th in the world, and she continued the dramatic improvement with a fifth-placed finish in her next start  There have been two more top-12s since for the world No  37 and a fine display in the first three rounds at Carlsbad last week, that left her in second with 18 holes to play. Alas, five dropped shots in three holes from the 12th forced Reid back into a tie for 26th but, as she said: “I have to take the positives from those first 54 holes. “To be honest, it was nice to see the hard work paying off. Jorge [Parada, her coach] and I had really been putting in the hours,” Reid said. “I missed the cut in Lake Nona last month and was really unhappy with the way I was hitting it. Jorge and I grinded on the range and I played half decent in Ocala the next week. There was a lot of good stuff in Carlsbad and I came here pretty confident.” Reid, a proven Solheim Cup performer, admits she is at her best when the glare is at its most fierce. Of course, the absence of fans at Mission Hills Country Club – at the 50th anniversary of the tournament that some will forever call the Dinah Shore Classic – means this will be another eerie affair, but the event’s status ensures that the competitors will experience what Reid terms “that special feeling”. “We will, because let’s face it, this is our version of the Masters, ‘the female Masters’ if you like,” she said.  “We come back to the same course every year, the caddies wear the boiler suits and the major has its own traditions, like the winner jumping in Poppie’s Pond behind the 18th green. “And the course is amazing and always brings drama. It’s in immaculate shape year in, year out. And because we return here on an annual basis, the memories are written large, just as they are at Augusta. “I always recall Webby [Australia’s Karrie Webb in 2006] holing out for an eagle on the 18th to get into a play-off and then birdieing the same hole again to beat Lorena [Ochoa]. “The place has a history of spectacular moments on the last three holes and it would be incredible to pen my own piece of history. I absolutely love this course and am glad I finally played well here in 2020, because I think it suits my game, in that you have to hit a lot of greens to contend. There’s no excuse on the putting, the balls are rolling beautifully.” Anyone who has followed Reid’s career since she leapt into the sport’s consciousness in 2007 at St Andrews as a teenage amateur finishing in the top 16 of the Women’s British Open, will be thrilled that she is at last fulfilling her potential. The death of her mother, Joy, in a car crash in 2012, pressed pause on her progress as she struggled with grief. The six-time Ladies European Tour winner earned a LPGA card in 2017 and with a third at the Women’s PGA Championship 18 months ago highlighted her enduring quality. Perhaps Reid was fortunate that the UK media had the rise of her younger countrywomen Charley Hull and Georgia Hall on whom to concentrate, as she was allowed to carry on grafting in the shadows and forming a backroom staff that, as well as Parada, includes fitness trainer Ken Macdonald, sports psychologist Howard Falco and last, but probably foremost, caddie Ryan “Desi” Desveaux. “It’s been a long time in the making, but at last I feel like I have some sort of formula and that my best years are still ahead of me,” she said. “I’m just extremely happy with my team and think they understand me and what I need. Desi is on the bag and we’ve become a great team. I have so many goals – this year’s Solheim Cup, the Olympics, which I’ve been very vocal about. I suppose there’s one way to achieve all those aims in one week.”",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/saviour-archewell-harry-meghan-hiredpromising-young-woman-producer/,culture,"Do Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have an Oscar in their sights? The latest hire for their Archewell media company is Ben Browning, an independent film producer whose work includes current   nominee  .  Announced Monday, Browning will be the head of content for Archewell Productions and Archewell Audio, guiding their partnerships with   and Spotify. The Sussexes signed a multi-year deal with the streamer in September 2020, and made another with   late last year. According to Forbes, a mutual contact in the entertainment industry recommended Browning, and multiple meetings followed, during which Harry and Meghan discussed their ambition to connect with a young, worldwide audience. That seems to be borne out by Browning’s statement this week, in which he said that was attracted by the couple’s vision for Archewell as “a global production company that will spotlight diverse voices and share uplifting stories.” The Archewell Netflix deal is for a variety of programming, including scripted and unscripted TV series, documentaries, feature films and children’s shows. Their Spotify deal is for them to both produce and host podcasts that uplift and entertain, kicked off by their   in December. So, what direction might Browning take Archewell in - and does this hint at the kind of output we can expect from Harry and Meghan? Browning is a fellow Brit, although he grew up all over the world. He’s a veteran film and television producer, who has also run various companies and started his own. He co-founded Wayfare Entertainment in 2008, and joined FilmNation Entertainment in 2014, relocating from New York to Los Angeles in the process.  Browning’s early projects included the TV series Masters of Horror and Fear Itself. He also executive produced, with James Cameron, the schlocky underwater cave action-thriller Sanctum. It’s safe to assume that the Sussexes aren’t about to produce a sequel. Of more interest in Browning’s recent body of work. That’s characterised by sensitive, distinctive yet commercial indie projects - such as  , featuring a Pakistani-American stand-up comic whose parents want him to enter into an arranged marriage. That 2017 film drew acclaim on its Sundance premiere and went on to gross $56 million worldwide on a budget of just $5 million, as well as picking up an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. He also worked on the cerebral sci-fi movie   and the stirring drama   - for which Brie Larson won a best actress Oscar. Additionally, Browning has executive produced successful screen adaptation of several novels, including Julian Barnes’  , starring Jim Broadbent, Charlotte Rampling, Harriet Walter and Michelle Dockery, and Ian McEwen’s  , starring Emma Thompson and Stanley Tucci. Browning then reunited with Thompson for  , in which she played a talk show host guided by Mindy Kaley’s new recruit. He also helped bring   to the screen: Armando Ianucci’s imaginative take on Charles Dickens, featuring bold creative choices and diverse casting. That experience should stand Browning in good stead when it comes to understanding Harry’s British point of view, and how to liaise between that and what works in Hollywood. Similarly, he knows how to turn out programming that is engrossing for viewers, as well as tackling important issues - whether it’s the intersection of the law and faith in The Children Act, Orthodox Judaism and sexuality in  , cultural differences in The Big Sick, colonial oppression in  , or systematic misogyny in Promising Young Woman. Browning is savvy about the streaming market too. Speaking to Deadline last January at Sundance, he commented on FilmNation’s record £13 million US sale of content to Amazon in 2019, led by movies like Late Night, saying that he felt it was an environment where the films would “get their best chance to reach an enthusiastic audience.” Browning also explained why they’d backed Promising Young Woman, with its “playful provocative script. It pulls no punches. It knows what it’s trying to say and I think that’s what audiences want from filmmakers.” He added that they’d pulled in plenty of well-known actors because it only took a day’s commitment, since they were shooting in LA. Speaking about his approach to projects, Browning said that FilmNation looked at “the financial profile of a film, the sales profile of a film, the distribution life of a film, and we’re trying to make responsible business decisions because most important to all of us is not that this company is thriving now but that it’s still thriving in 10 years.” However, he balanced that with backing singular ideas. “The real distinction point of any creative company is knowing where and when to take risks. The process here is that it starts with one person who works here thinking something is absolutely exceptional and not shutting up about it and conveying that to other people who work here.” Browning characterised their projects as “a little left of centre or a little representative of what is about to come in a cultural conversation.” That certainly sounds like it fits with the Sussexes’ new   and professed desire - as per the Archewell website - to “drive systemic cultural change across all communities, one act of compassion at a time”, and to use their production company in “harnessing the power of storytelling to embrace our shared humanity, amplifying diverse and inspiring content.” But beyond shared sensibilities about “inspiring content”, what’s perhaps most important here is Browning’s track record in actually delivering slick, professional projects that connect with audiences and make money. Given the Sussexes’ inexperience in this area (as demonstrated by their debut podcast) and the “demands” of  , having a partner with practical skills and knowledge is what might lift this from vaguely well-meant vanity project to real industry force. After all, there’s only so many times you can play the   card, or pal around with  . At some point, Harry and Meghan will need to let their work do the talking.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/line-duty-needs-stop-pretending-takes-place-real-world/,culture,"While last week’s Line of Duty   saw many of its record 9.6 million viewers fixated on the show’s bewildering acronyms (in particular, the rude-sounding  ), talk of the   was of Jimmy Savile.  As anti-corruption unit AC-12 looked into the murder investigation of journalist Gail Vella, they watched videos of her past reporting - which played rather like a  , but with some queasy real-life policing chucked in.  In one clip, Vella (Andi Osho) covered the conviction of former chief superintendent  , an unmasked member of a VIP paedophile ring who we last saw in series three of the drama. Jed Mercurio courted controversy then by including a doctored image of Fairbank and another suspect, local politician Dale Roach, alongside the real-life sex offender Jimmy Savile. But Savile wasn’t actually name-checked in the show until last night. In her report, referencing the cover-ups perpetrated by figures like Fairbank, Vella said: “It’s now a matter of public record that Jimmy Savile cultivated relationships with senior police officers” - accompanied once again by that image of Savile with Fairbank and Roach, blurring reality and fiction. Vella continued: “Savile exploited those relationships to intimidate anyone attempting to investigate his offending. We now realise what Savile was getting out of those relationships with senior police officers. What remains unknown - and uninvestigated - is what those officers were getting out of their relationship with Savile.” The explicit references to Savile shocked many viewers, who shared their uneasiness on Twitter. One commented “A Savile storyline? Poor taste to put it politely”, while another said: “Bloody hell, Mr Mercurio is going a bit bloody close to the bone with this one.” However, former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal also took to Twitter, pointing out that “Jimmy Savile has been involved in more criminal conspiracies than anyone I’ve ever dealt with - real & fictional. No surprise he turns up in #LineofDuty.” Previously,   between the police and Savile, saying: “The fact is that Savile bragged of his close relationships with officers.” The series three storyline strongly evoked Operation Yewtree, and a subsequent investigation into links between organised crime and corrupt officers, in series five, had the very similar name of Operation Pear Tree. So, is Mercurio attempting some amateur detective work via his drama, in the vein of Serial or Tiger King? Or is he just using   to spice up the series? If the latter, he’s treading on dangerous ethical ground. It’s also a far cry from the   of Line of Duty, with its deliberately vague geographical setting (an unnamed city in the Midlands), fictional forces like Central Police, and clearly invented characters. That distancing allowed viewers to delve into the world of modern policing, while still enjoying it as a TV drama. But series six is inching ever more into our world - with uncomfortable results. It wasn’t just Savile who made a startling appearance last night. The late Vella’s producer told AC-12 that she was doing her own podcast, to reveal truths that she couldn’t get on air, and that she was inspired by the podcast on Daniel Morgan. Again, this is a blatant true-crime reference. The cited podcast -  , presented by Peter Jukes and brother Alistair Morgan - delves into the murder of the private investigator in 1987. It alleges that Morgan had uncovered major corruption and drug trafficking within the Metropolitan Police, and that he was killed to stop him exposing it. Morgan’s murder officially remains unsolved. There’s also the inescapable parallels between Line of Duty’s Vella case and the killing of   - including the police questioning whether the perpetrator was an obsessive fan (the accused Barry George in real life; Terry Boyle in the drama), or whether this was a professional hit job. Mercurio’s series has always had a basis in actual policing. The writer consults retired and servicing officers on his scripts, and scans anonymous police blogs. That’s evident in the series’ assiduous use of  , regulations, paperwork, and painstaking interviews.  But this latest series is much blunter about dragging in real-world parallels, making it jarring for viewers. There is still a certain suspension of disbelief needed to make Line of Duty work, and that’s at odds with its fictional journalist actually commentating on Savile. Vella also referenced series one’s corruption case, involving a counter-terrorism squad raiding the wrong flat and shooting an innocent man, then lying to cover each other’s backs. AC-12’s Superintendent Hastings, played by  , is particularly outraged that the unit’s commanding officer - who led the cover-up - was then “made chief”. The plot line is obviously inspired by the murder of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was wrongly identified as a suicide bomber by the Met and gunned down at Stockwell Tube station in 2005; in the aftermath, officers initially lied about their actions. So, is this Mercurio criticising the appointment of Cressida Dick - who headed the operation - as Met chief? Dick has also, of course, been in the news recently after her force’s poor handling of the Sarah Everard vigil. An unrepentant Dick has expressed outrage at Mercurio’s portrayal of “the level of casual and extreme corruption” in the police. And while the series isn’t a documentary, and makes no such claims, it does have certain responsibilities as a popular primetime BBC programme. Can Mercurio really make allegations about actual crimes and police officers via his show?  It might be just about acceptable legally - even, some might argue, a public service - but it’s dubious dramatically. If we’re meant to be viewing Line of Duty with the sober earnestness applied to the Dando, Savile or de Menezes cases, that’s a very different proposition to enjoying a Sunday-night thriller with some basis in reality, but which takes plenty of creative license. In short: it sucks the fun out of it. Start treating the realm of Line of Duty as one bound by the rules of actual policing, and the whole thing collapses. Of course our AC-12 team would have been disbanded by now, given their many and various misdemeanours (not least sleeping with an unending string of suspects and witnesses). Nor should they be investigating the unit where their former colleague, Kate Fleming, works. That’s a job for AC-1-through-11, surely. And series three’s   is utterly absurd if you place it in a real-world context. Mercurio should also take care that he doesn’t put the spotlight on his own actions. A telling line in last night’s episode, in reference to Vella, was “female journalists get the worst of it.” Well, they do from Mercurio, who attacked a Guardian journalist on Twitter in 2019 for daring to criticise his show and, speaking to GQ earlier this month, doubled down by calling her a c___. Opening up Line of Duty to serious scrutiny is a Pandora’s box. Mercurio might well regret it - and so will his viewers.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/joanna-lumley-inequality-acting-women-will-always-have-beautiful/,culture,"Female performers will always be under more pressure to look good than their male counterparts, believes  . Reflecting on her career, she noted that women were constantly sexualised, and that even though that culture has shifted, we’re unlikely to ever have true equality. The Absolutely Fabulous actress commented on the industry while speaking to Libby Purves at last night’s Telegraph Subscriber event, A Night In With Joanna Lumley. “Women for a long, long time were the lovely ones, and you always had to look extremely beautiful if you were going to be an actress,” said Lumley. “If you’re a beauty queen, you understand that. But if you’re an actress, you’re playing a part. Why do you have to be beautiful?” In contrast, she noted, male performers “like Humphrey Bogart could have lined cheeks and furrowed brows. It’s always been unfair. And guess what: it’s always going to be unfair.  “I know people are always trying to reach for parity. I’ve a funny feeling it will never happen, because in the whole long time that human beings have been alive, women have always had to look good for men to like them, and men have always had to be ‘attractive’ for women to like them. ‘Attractive’ means they might have lots of money, or might be good at something, or might look as though they could provide. They didn’t have to be handsome necessarily.” Lumley also recalled being ordered to strip off for roles in the 1970s. “It was absolutely mandatory, and if you didn’t want to do it, they’d go ‘Are you an actress or not?’.” Since Lumley was coming from the modelling world, and hadn’t been to drama school, she felt she had to comply. But it wasn’t just her, she notes. “Everybody had to take their tops off. You just see it with Vanessa Redgrave, Glenda Jackson, Jacqueline Bisset… Everybody had to strip their tops off. That was completely par for the course.” She added: “I hated it. I’ve never met a single person who likes to get their clothes off. Or indeed people who like to do love scenes. Everybody was revolted by love scenes.” Lumley recounted another grim experience, while taking her announcement picture for playing Purdey in The New Avengers. “They put me in a flimsy, flimsy dress with flimsy high heels, and they said ‘We’d like you to stick a gun in your stocking top, Joanna’, and I said ‘But I’m wearing tights’.”  They refused to take her picture without stockings, so she had to borrow some from a stranger. “Everything was like that in those days,” she explained. “You just did it. I hate having to have done it. Which is why when I eventually was asked to do stage parts like Hedda Gabler and Madame Ranevskaya, it was sweet as a nut. I’m never asked to do those parts on television. I’m still either a bitch or glamorous.” The exception was Ab Fab, where she was allowed to play a grotesque alongside Jennifer Saunders. “The more ridiculous and revolting we looked, the more people loved them.” Lumley described Patsy as hunching over because “she’s had all her inside taken out and her bottom [was] gone. She hadn’t eaten since 1974.” Patsy’s hair evoked Ivanna Trump’s, she added, and her smirking laugh was based on Elvis. Lumley, who is married to conductor Stephen Barlow, and is a trustee of Grange Park Opera, also commented on how the emphasis on physical appearance has changed in the opera world.  “In the old days, the voice was everything, and people thought you should just go to the theatre, the opera house and be grateful for the sound,” she noted. “Then gradually it began to creep in that more and more directors, and maybe even the public, said ‘Hang on, if she’s playing this drop-dead gorgeous woman, maybe she should look a little bit better than that. Maybe she shouldn’t look like ten-ton Tessie.' I’ll probably be killed for even saying that.  “But the truth is maybe she   look a little bit more like the role. Because a lot of that overeating was part of it. It was a kind of myth that the way to have a beautiful voice was to be quite big and bosom-y and fat stomach-ed. That’s been disproved. Now you see the most gorgeous opera singers with ravishing voices looking great. And of course they’re much fitter and they’re much lither and they’re much more believable as actresses, as singing actresses, on stage.” In her own career, Lumley got an early acting break with a guest role on Coronation Street as a love interest for Ken Barlow. “I was written as just an interlude,” she explained. “His wife had just been killed by a hairdryer. The whole world was in shock: ‘What would handsome Ken do now?’. I was the schoolmaster's daughter. I shimmied into his life.” It was an exciting opportunity – and one she was eager to extend. But the producers were firm that it was just an eight-episode run. In fact, she was asked to reprise the role recently but wasn’t able to do it, so Stephanie Beacham joined the show instead. “I was jealous as hell of her,” admitted Lumley. But her great love is Shakespeare – which she’s never been asked to do professionally, she lamented. Her dream role is Rosalind in As You Like It. As for her other role as an activist, working with organisations like Kids for Kids in Dafur and the Gurkha Justice Campaign, might that tempt Lumley to go into politics fulltime? Certainly not. “I had a glimpse of it during the gurkha campaign. I had a look into the corridors of power, and it doesn’t appeal to me because it’s too slow. I don’t want it to go into some committee in a month’s time and then people say ‘We’ll look at it more closely.’ I can’t bear all that. I want it to be done now. So I wouldn’t mind being a benevolent dictator, but I don’t want to be in Parliament.”",1

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/classical-music/review-top-best-classical-concerts-opera-march-2021/,culture,"While other venues sputter like damp fireworks, Wigmore Hall keeps going, bringing us top-level music-making day after day. Sometimes they even offer two concerts in a single day, which was normal back in “normal” times, but now seems like almost reckless profusion. Yesterday was one such cornucopia. In the evening, tenor Ian Bostridge and pianist Julius Drake performed Schubert, Debussy and Fauré; but first, at lunchtime, we heard four members of the recently formed chamber group Kaleidoscope, now an “associate ensemble” of the hall. They offered an all-French programme that reversed the normal order of a menu, going from feather-light trifle to meaty masterpiece. The trifle came from Melanie Bonis, one of those doughty 19th-century female composers who managed to make it in an almost exclusively male world. She’s now being rediscovered, but one has to hope there are stronger pieces among her 300 works than the two-movement Soir Matin (Evening Morning) we heard yesterday. In this performance the opening movement came across as gently beautiful – frankly, a bit too gentle. Perhaps if the playing had been more full-blooded, this collection of musical swags and furbelows might have been more engaging. The performers’ sweetly gentle approach was right for the more engaging Matin, which was interestingly troubled: more grey clouds than radiant new dawn. That slightly lop-sided emphasis on the intimate and gentle was evident in the performance of the Second Piano Quartet by Gabriel Fauré, which rounded off the concert. It’s true that much of the music inhabits a sweetly intimate world – the composer Aaron Copland described it admiringly as “a long sigh of infinite tenderness” – but that’s not the half of it. There’s real unruly passion under the soft outlines of the music, which didn’t always shine through in this performance. The second movement should burst with frustrated fury, but pianist Tom Poster softened the angry left-hand figure with a touch of pedal, and the plucked chords from the three string players were more polite than savage. Still, the tender moments were indeed tender, especially those in which violinist Elena Urioste’s drooping phrases were echoed by cellist Colin Carr, though the plaintive responses of violist Rosalind Ventris – the echoes finding their own echo, as it were – were actually the most affecting of all. In between the two billowing romantic effusions of Bonis and Fauré came the stark and stony D’un Soir Triste (A Sad Evening) by Lili Boulanger. Thanks to the recent revival of her music, it’s become clear that the early death at 24 of this slender, always-sickly woman was the most grievous loss in 20th-century music. This extraordinary piece, written in the shadow of the First World War, seems to come from some desolate, blasted region too dreadful even for sorrow – a quality the performers caught and held with just the right halting, stunned eloquence. You know you’re in for a good evening when the performers are visibly enjoying themselves. Pleasure in co-ordinated action always enlivens the sound as well as the look of a concert, and it gives an extra warmth to the music’s emotional qualities. That was certainly the case at this terrific Scottish Chamber Orchestra concert, which was curated and compèred by Louise Goodwin, one of the orchestra’s percussionists, filmed in Perth Concert Hall and now is streaming online. Goodwin came up with a short vivid programme that put Baroque and American minimalist composers together, so we could enjoy the shared obsession with repeating patterns and rhythmic energy. It’s a common enough conceit, but it worked especially well here, as the contrasts in emotional weight and sound were huge. Henry Purcell’s Chacony in G minor and D major Fantasia bookended the concert in a dancing mood, the intertwined lines in the two violins and viola nicely poised over the driving double-bass, cello and harpsichord. There was a different sort of poise in Steve Reich’s Nagoya Marimbas, more aloof and detached but with a suppressed joy, well caught in this performance from Goodwin and her fellow marimba player Rich Cartlidge. Then came the concert’s rapt still centre, in the shape of Fratres, the oft-played masterpiece by the Estonian so-called “holy minimalist” Arvo Pärt, played here in an arrangement for string quartet and two percussionists. Over a never-changing drone on viola, a patiently circling melody, intoned by the other three string players with exquisite softness, slowly gained weight as it descended. Between each descent, the two percussionists tapped out a rhythm in chipped wooden sounds and muffled bass drum that was tiny yet monumental. It was like some inscrutable ritual purged of human feeling, yet moving nevertheless. In this exalted company, the concert’s most recent piece, Dani Howard’s Shades, felt distinctly thin. The idea of a vibraphone solo in dialogue with its own “virtual” shadow – generated by a foot-pedal attached to a computer – produced some promising moments, and Goodwin relished the concert’s only opportunity for some tempo flexibility and expressive playing. But it felt like a sketch for something that needed to be bigger. This and everything else was blown away by Workers Union, a pungent piece of musical protest from the 1970s. Freedom through unity was a common slogan in those days, and the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen caught the idea brilliantly. It’s a piece for any number of players on loud instruments, all hammering away at driving syncopated rhythms in perfect co-ordination, but each left free to choose their own notes. It’s a piece I always imagined needed the brute physical impact of saxophones and brass played at ear-splitting volume, and the idea of transferring it to the polite Baroque-ish ensemble of strings and harpsichord seemed risky. In fact, it was wonderful. Andriessen once said Workers Union needed to sound aggressive, but he was wrong: it just needs to be joyous and superlatively well-drilled, and the music will seem triumphant – as it did here. Opera has not been an entirely closed book during lockdown, but sheer expense has proved a disincentive to the staging of full-dress filmed productions, of the kind recently mounted by some well-heeled European houses. Faced with this challenge, a few British counterparts have boldly repurposed themselves. English National Opera’s ENO Breathe workshops, for instance, put the expertise of its singers at the service of “long Covid” sufferers, helping them to harness the power of deep breathing and singing. For Opera North, instead of the audience going to the company, the company goes to the audience. Its ONe-to-ONe scheme offers short solo performances to patrons for free, given via Zoom by members of the orchestra and chorus. Unsurprisingly, it has caught on like wildfire. The first batch of 96 10-minute slots were snapped up within an hour. It’s a lucky dip: you might be offered a poetry reading, an instrumental recital or an aria. I logged on at the appointed time, and was faced with the cheerfully smiling face of Katie Walker, a mezzo-soprano in the chorus. There was a moment’s awkwardness on my part. How do you face a skilled performer who’s about to give a performance just for your benefit? I felt like some  king. But not for long, as Walker soon launched into one of my favourite arias, the impassioned Amour! viens aider ma faiblesse! (Love, come to the aid of my weakness!) from Camille Saint-Saëns’s Samson and Delilah. She performed with the aid of a pre-recorded orchestral background, and sang with such full-blooded passion that I felt I ought to stand to attention (or at least put down my coffee mug). Afterwards, I asked her how she finds these solo performances. “I love them,” she said simply. “It’s a way of actually meeting our audiences and finding out what they like.” My second slot, from orchestral leader David Creed, was just as enjoyable. He played a movement from Bach’s A minor Partita with engagingly forthright severity. And not all ONe-to-ONe performances are in fact one-to-one. I eavesdropped on a slightly longer performance for a Leeds care-home – given, again, by the indefatigable Walker. She sang Seguidilla from Carmen, a number from Kiss Me Kate and a tear-jerking Edwardian ballad, I’ll Walk Beside You. As far as I could judge, it went down a storm. Thus far there have been 162 performances, with more to come, and they’re sold out into April. In their modesty and intimacy, they’re as far from the grandeur of “normal” opera as you could imagine, and they must have carried the name of Opera North into places it has never reached before. That’s certainly a silver lining for the company, in these dark and difficult times. As this live-streamed concert reminded us, even the best-laid plans can be derailed by the pandemic. The LSO’s music director Sir Simon Rattle had invited star Canadian soprano Barbara Hannigan to sing two great 20th-century works with the orchestra, the rapturously nostalgic Knoxville: Summer of 1915 by Samuel Barber, and Edgard Varèse’s sultrily sinister Offrandes (Offerings). Both had to quarantine, as they were travelling from abroad – then, with rehearsals well under way, the test and trace system removed Rattle from the picture. It seemed as if a deputy conductor would have to be called in. Hannigan, however, had other ideas. She pursues a parallel career as a conductor, so why couldn’t she conduct Barber’s piece herself, as well as sing it? This wouldn’t be unprecedented for her, but to my knowledge she’s a unique case, for obvious reasons. The two roles of performing and conducting are often combined by concerto soloists; it was the norm in the 18th century. But there’s something about the physicality of singing that makes simultaneous conducting inconceivable – or so it seemed, until Hannigan came along. She had precisely 24 hours to prepare, and being a brilliant musician, pulled it off. To ask whether this also resulted in a moving performance might seem unfair. But, in truth, it didn’t quite come off. Hannigan was, as ever, elegantly unflappable and technically impeccable, soaring up to pianissimo top notes while cueing the clarinets with one hand and maintaining a pulse with the other. But expressively she seemed somewhat out-of-focus. Barber’s piece sets a rhapsodic prose poem by James Agee, in which the author looks back from regretful adulthood to his six-year-old self, who gazes up at the stars on a warm night while enjoying the cosy sound of adult voices murmuring in the dark. The piece emerges from deep peace and returns to it – yet Hannigan launched off in an anxiously tremulous manner. This meant that later, when the music became genuinely anguished, she had less room for manoeuvre. Rattle had in fact been released from quarantine in the nick of time, and he could have taken over, but he agreed to let Hannigan conduct anyway. This was gallant, but didn’t lead to the best musical result. Later in the evening, by contrast, for the performance of Varèse’s Offrandes, Hannigan was able to leave the orchestra in Rattle’s hands, and the results were superb. Varèse set two surrealist poems that evoke visions of ancient tropical deities, and Rattle and the LSO gave the opening just the right throaty primeval-swamp quality. Hannigan’s voice seemed to tip-toe amongst the fetid ticking and scraping of the percussion and the abrupt menace of the muted brass, and only at the end did the suppressed panic finally break out. We stayed with ancient pagan deities for The Song of Quetzalcoatl by Lou Harrison, that Californian devotee of all things far-away and ancient. Its austere rhythmic patterns, pattered out with unflappable control by four percussionists, were as aloof as Varèse’s piece was sinister. Finally, to banish these disquieting visions, came the rarely-performed complete ballet score of Ravel’s Ma mère l’Oye (Mother Goose). The sumptuous orchestral sound, garlanded with exquisite solo playing from oboist Juliana Koch, leader Roman Simović and others, wrapped us in nostalgia, and the closing tableau, Le jardin féerique (Fairy Garden), conducted by Rattle at a luxuriantly slow pace, glittered and shone like a vision of bliss. Mozart’s final opera, inspired by the jealousies and murderous intrigues around the nobly forgiving Roman emperor Titus Vespasian, can be a magnificent spectacle. All those processions of senators and noble ladies in their pomp, with the Forum in the background. At the climax of the first Act one of the conspirators actually burns down the Capitol, which is a chance for a properly picturesque apocalypse.   But not here. Spectacle and pyrotechnics are in distinctly short supply in Bergen National Opera’s new production. Originally due to be staged last March and then cancelled because of the pandemic, the production took place, as ever, at the Grieg Hall, where it was rethought from scratch to take account of social distancing rules on stage. When restrictions on travel became even more severe, a number of international singers had to be stood down and replaced with Norwegians, one or two of whom had to learn their parts in less than a fortnight. The London-based production team led by director Rodula Gaitanou had to work remotely, giving directions via computer screens. Frankly it’s a miracle the production took place at all, and certainly the difficult conditions have left their mark. In terms of mise-en-scène the black backdrop and black featureless stage seem at first just too austere to fire the imagination. The six characters in designer Cordelia Chisholm’s grey business suits are often seen at a row of desks at the back, suggesting that, when not maddened by jealous passion, they’re just a bunch of Imperial bureaucrats. When they are thus maddened, they dash forward and move in attitudes of fury or anguish between five well-spaced illuminated squares, as if to suggest the intrigues between them are like moves on a chess-board. This is a nice conceit, though why it had to be enacted quite so austerely is a mystery; surely a bit of colour would have helped. And giving Tito a chain of office like those worn by Lord Mayors wasn’t a good move. Combined with his perpetually worried look it made it seem as if he’d just been heckled at the opening of a new bus depot. Yet somehow the performance rose above the conceit and took wing. Things got off to the best possible start with the overture, performed by the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra under their chief conductor Edward Gardner with startling energy. Then, before we had a chance to take a breath, on came soprano Beate Mordal in a sexy white trouser suit. She plays the nastiest of the conspirators Vitellia, spitting fury and impressive vocal pyrotechnics because Tito—whom she’d had her eye on—wants to marry a Jewish princess. She’s followed by her besotted admirer Sesto played by Adrian Angelico, who agrees reluctantly to be the assassin. And so the conspiracy takes shape.  Among the other roles, Ingeborg Gillebo as Sesto’s well-meaning friend Annio and Frøy Hovland Holtbakk as his sister Servilia are both equally vivid. Bror Magnus Tødenes seems under strain vocally as Tito, but he movingly conveys the anguish of the twice-betrayed Emperor.  But the real star of the show is the orchestra, above all the player on the basset horn whose sound rapturously entwines with the singers in the opera’s most beautiful arias. At the end, when all are forgiven and the terrific chorus and orchestra fling out the final chorus, the stage is flooded with light—suggesting that Tito is actually an Enlightenment monarch born ahead of time. Greyness gives way to radiance, a transformation we could all wish for at this moment. The vocal group Voces8 inspires awe. As well as singing like angels they run an educational foundation and their own venue, and throughout the lockdown they’ve offered filmed festivals of choral and other music which for production values and musical quality are second to none. Last night’s concert, the seventh in their Spring Festival, was conceived and led by none other than Dame Emma Kirkby. To call her the doyenne of British singers of the so-called “early” music would be no more than the simple truth. The pearly radiant tones of that voice, and Kirkby’s winning way with the words of old Italian and English texts made her for a while the best-selling British classical artist in Europe. But she’s so much more than that. She has an interest in song from every country and era, as this concert proved. And doyenne in any case seems the wrong word. It implies an aristocratic, haughty mastery, whereas Kirkby has the eagerness and vulnerable expressivity of a young singer, as she showed time and again. Some doyennes have capacious egos too, but at this concert from “Dame Emma Kirkby and Friends” the Dame refused to hog the show. The idea of a concert for Mothering Sunday devoted to songs about maternity from the 12th to the 21st century was entirely hers, but she ceded most of the limelight to her fine bunch of young singers and instrumentalists. Among them were lutenist Toby Carr and harpist Aileen Henry, agile and sensitive accompanists in Italian songs devoted to the Virgin. There was fine pianist Christopher Glynn, who accompanied Dame Emma in one of the more innocent songs from Paul Hindemith’s Das Marienleben (the Life of Mary). There was multi-instrumentalist Matt Redman, whose strumming guitar and banjo ushered us into the world of songs about motherhood from the Civil War and First World War, when anti-war protest was joined to a note of stoical grieving. Sharing the songs with Dame Emma were two mezzo-sopranos who were tellingly contrasted with her and each other. Patricia Hammond had the softer more cushioned voice of the two, and the combination of her caressing tone with soft-edged harmonium and piano in a movement from the Stabat Mater by Clémence de Granval—a little-known but clearly wonderful 19th-century Parisian composer—was the most deliciously tender moment of the evening. Helen Charleston had a darker sound, with a sharper expressive edge. She was spellbinding in Tarquinio Merula’s long lullaby sung by the Virgin to her child, rising to muted climaxes of sadness as she foresees the life that lies ahead of him. Dame Emma, not to be outdone, reminded us how well she communicates aspiration and fervour in Barbara Strozzi’s wonderful Hymn to the Virgin. The most radiantly beautiful moment of the evening actually came at the beginning, when all three singers joined in Hildegard of Bingen’s song in praise of the Virgin. The three voices rose and fell in waves of melody, so rhapsodic and free and weightless it felt as if it could continue for eternity. All praise to the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra for continuing with their streamed concert series. We’ve missed the galvanising presence of their chief conductor, Kirill Karabits, but they’ve had a range of interesting guest conductors and soloists, including John Eliot Gardiner and Stephen Hough, who together gave a terrific performance of Brahms’s First Piano Concerto. Last night it was the turn of 32-year-old Polish conductor Marta Gardolińska, who led a programme of two crisp, classically-proportioned symphonies, separated by a delicious slice of Russian late-romanticism. Gardolińska was an athlete in a previous life, and she brought an invigorating light touch to Schubert’s symphony and an exact sense of tempo proportions, finding precisely the contrasting tempo for the swaying, bucolic middle section of the hearty third movement. Alas, the players were not as nimble as she. Every orchestra must be allowed the occasional off-night, and this was the clearly the BSO’s. The string ensemble was particularly patchy, especially in the finale – though here I sensed that Gardolińska was forcing the pace to a point where the music would have lost its smile anyway. The six minutes of rustling, undulating stillness that was Anatol Liadov’s The Enchanted Lake came as a welcome moment of summery charm. Liadov’s chief claim to fame was that he failed to deliver the music for Diaghilev’s ballet The Firebird, giving a break to a composer of whom no-one had heard – Igor Stravinsky. The Bournemouth SO’s playing here came into focus, and the music positively glowed. The interesting thing is that Liadov’s dreamy waterscape sounded very like some of the more enchanted moments in Stravinsky’s score. Sometimes the gap between talent and genius is not so great.   These two pieces were, in their different days, completely open and straightforward, with no dark corners or puzzling moments. By contrast, the final piece of the evening, Shostakovich’s Ninth Symphony, consists of nothing but puzzling moments. It was composed just after the end of the Second World War, so everyone was expecting Shostakovich to deliver a properly weighty and triumphant utterance. What they got was something which launched off in a scandalously perky mood. Gardolińska was determined to play up to that, with a jauntily fast tempo and ear-rasping trombone and piccolo. Then came one of Shostakovich’s typically abrupt emotional switch-backs, with a long lament for two clarinets which – in this performance at least – emerged as dignified and objective, rather than heart-rending. The third movement took us back to the jollity of the opening movement, but now with a sharp and sardonic edge, emanating mostly from the superbly brazen sound of the orchestra’s principal trumpeter, Chris Avison. Gardolińska seemed to be taking us on a journey of ever-increasing polar opposites, through the doleful tuba and bassoon of the fourth movement, and onto the manic rush to the end. It was a convincing view of this puzzling piece, and a brilliantly exciting end to a concert which had more than its share of slip-ups along the way.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/classical-music/best-classical-music-reviews-2021-cds-albums-dvds/,culture,"The Traveller of this delightful album is the Sicilian born-and-bred cellist Alessio Pianelli, a Fellow of the prestigious Borletti-Buitoni Awards scheme for talented young musicians. The award provided the wherewithal to make this recording, in which Pianello makes a musical tour through the folk traditions of Balkan and near Eastern countries before ending in his own beloved native island. In the liner notes Pianelli reminds us Sicily has been constantly invaded by settlers who left traces of their culture behind, but he isn’t pedantic about historical accuracy – in fact only the three Greek folk-songs arranged by the reclusive and still-undiscovered Greek modernist Nikos Skalkottas could plausibly claim a connection with Sicily. The real thread linking them is Pianelli’s own curiosity and taste, which is clearly good because he’s unearthed some real folk gems, all arranged by notable composers from their respective countries. The most familiar things on the disc are the seven Romanian folk dances originally collected and arranged by Béla Bartók. They are wonderful, but much more intriguing are the seven Miniatures by Georgian composer Sulkhan Tsintsadze, the five folk-songs arranged by the Armemian priest Komitas, who almost lost his life during the Armenian genocide, and those three Greek folk-songs. Standing somewhat to one side are Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s Negro Melodies, which remind one irresistibly of Dvořák. To record these songs Pianelli first of all re-arranged them for solo cello and the Rome-based Avos string orchestra. It’s an immense labour of love which Pianelli has carried out with great tact as well as musical imagination. The deep tragedy of the Armenian songs, the lighter charm of the Georgian melodies, and the eccentric, tangy quality of the Greek pieces all shine through, thanks to Pianelli’s playing which is changeable as quicksilver and mournful as a folk balladeer. At the end Pianelli returns home, playing his own witty variations on a Sicilian melody. It’s a fine end to a disc that glows with Mediterranean and Near Eastern heat, and if we really can’t get away to the sun this summer it will bring some comfort. Intimacy and grandeur seem the least likely bedfellows, but it’s precisely that unlikely conjunction that gives Elgar’s music its unique flavour. So often in his music a huge public utterance girded with brass and military rhythms seems to melt away before our very ears, and we suddenly find ourselves in a twilight landscape of regret and nostalgia. In no work is that special quality more hauntingly evident than the Violin Concerto. Elgar composed it in 1910 in response to a request from the American virtuoso Fritz Kreisler, who was determined to have a concerto from the man he said was the greatest living composer. Elgar responded with a concerto on the same heroic scale as Brahms’s, full of vaunting virtuoso passages where the violinist has to dominate the orchestra. But unlike Brahms’s it has a cadenza which instead of being a moment of heroic display is a tender rumination on previously heard ideas, accompanied by thrumming plucked chords which – in this performance at least – sound like the quiet rustling of nature on a summer afternoon. French violinist Renaud Capuçon turns out to be an ideal soloist for this very English work. He catches the music’s quicksilver spirit, the way at one moment it’s gathering pace and intensity towards a high point, the next hesitating in small, shy phrases, or pulling back by degrees towards a moment of radiant calm, like a patch of sunlight in a forest. Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra are every bit as sensitive and labile, and the subtle weave of Elgar’s orchestration takes on a lovely glow. If I don’t place it right at the top of available recordings of the concerto that’s because it feels a touch too spacious and meditative, missing that eager, impetuous quality that the recent recording by James Ehnes and the Philharmonia Orchestra catches so well. About the recording of the sonata in which Capuçon is partnered by pianist Stephen Hough I have no such reservations. The dialogue between pianist and violin is beautifully clear, and the balance between tender soliloquy and grandiloquence feels exactly right. Some pianists charm and caress you with subtle shadings and half-tones, some seize you by the scruff with steely-fingered decisiveness. Clare Hammond is definitely one of the latter sort. Her latest album, an exploration of the art of variation – i.e. ringing ever-more elaborate changes on a pattern or melody announced at the beginning – certainly shows off that aspect of her talent. It avoids the familiar masters of the genre like Beethoven and Schumann, focusing instead on 20th and 21st-century pieces. Among them is the Variations by Aaron Copland, a piece that will instantly disabuse anyone of the idea that Copland was just a purveyor of cheerful, all-American folksiness. Its pitiless, hard-edged abstraction made it a favourite of Leonard Bernstein, who took a mischievous delight in emptying the room at swanky Manhattan parties by playing it at full volume. Hammond makes it seem as huge and steely as the Brooklyn Bridge, but without resorting to sheer force. She balances the sonorities carefully, so we can hear the original idea gleaming through all the dissonant barbed-wire Copland erects around it.  The same combination of power and dramatic sweep with careful attention to detail can be heard in the other pieces. In the craggy, immense Chaconne by Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina she allows no respite from the drama, which builds in waves of rising and falling tension to the final dénoument. She softens the sinews of Hindemith’s severe 1936 Variations with subtle tempo variations, and brings a nice sense of cat-like stealth to Birtwistle’s Variations on the Golden Mountain. Not everything is hard and monumental. John Adams’s I Still Play has a diffident waltz-like charm. And the Variations on a Polish Theme by Karol Szymanowski is as far from Copland as you could imagine. The piece is in his most impressionist, sensuous vein, and Hammond responds with a delicate but still firmly shaped touch, and a deft use of pedal that reveals the bones under all the luxurious flesh. It may not be a masterpiece but Hammond keeps us enthralled to the last bar. Der Freischütz (“The Freeshooter”) was one of the smash operatic hits of the 19th century. Carl Maria von Weber’s dark tale of a hunter who makes with a pact with the devil so he can win a shooting competition and win the head forester’s daughter was the spark that lit the German Romantic revolution in opera. Wagner was electrified by it, and said that without Der Freischütz he would never have become a composer. By the end of the 19th century the opera’s naïve supernatural trappings, such as the chorus of gibbering spirits gathered in a forest clearing at midnight, were starting to seem creaky. In the early 21st century there are other reasons to be embarrassed by Der Freischütz, especially the heartily patriarchal culture of back-slapping hunters and docile womenfolk. But never fear. This combined CD/DVD offers a French production from 2019 which couldn’t possibly embarrass anyone. The name is a giveaway: “The Freischütz Project”. It suggests this opera can’t simply be presented, it must be given a makeover to make it palatable to modern tastes. Some aspects of the makeover are actually welcome. The Insula Orchestra uses “period” instruments appropriate to the early 19th century, so the biting horns and twilight gloom of Weber’s orchestration seem unusually vivid. The performances, especially Johanni van Oostrum as the faithful Agathe are strong. Other aspects of the makeover are simply annoying. Both the CD and the DVD offer only highlights of the opera, so neither gives a complete narrative. The charming bridal chorus sung by Agathe’s bridesmaids which is the opera’s most famous number is actually omitted, presumably because it was felt to be reprehensibly patriarchal. The production takes place on an austere bare stage, without even a hint of the opera’s German-forest setting – apart from the inevitable use of back-projection to give us literal forest-scenes, which as always with back-projections absolutely fails to stimulate the imagination. If you really want to feel the thrill of Weber’s opera, put on the CD of the classic recording conducted by Erich Kleiber in 1955, sit back and close your eyes. It’s the only “Freischütz Project” you’ll ever need. The charmingly fresh-faced young Z.E.N. piano trio is made up of an American violinist, a Chinese pianist and an Armenian cellist, who came together in 2015 when they were members of BBC Radio 3’s New Generation Artist scheme. Their name is nothing to do with Buddhism, it’s simply a neat acronym of the first letters of their first names, and there’s nothing meditative about their new CD, a collection of four Russian pieces centred around Shostakovich’s great E minor Trio of 1944. It’s hard to overstate the tragic depth of this piece, which was inspired by the early death of Shostakovich’s great friend the musicologist and polymath Ivan Sollertinsky but was also overshadowed by the war. In the Finale there’s a tune of unmistakeably Jewish character which is hammered out in a frenzy, a musical image of despair which some say was inspired by the revelation that SS guards made Jewish prisoners dance next to their own graves. The combination of bleak ghostly lament and savage parody leads many trios to exaggerate the extremes, but that isn’t The Z.E.N. Trio’s way. They prefer a more traditionally musical approach, allowing space for those subtle variations in tempo and expressive mouldings of phrases which a performance pitched at a constant scream of maximum intensity can’t manage. On the whole tempos are faster than average, which makes the narrative of the Finale where all the previous movements pass by like a dream easier to grasp. Their performance is no less moving than more overtly tragic performances, and its only drawback is that here and there the pianist Zhang Zuo seems underpowered. Alongside Shostakovich's trio are two pieces, both beautifully played, which show a very different side of Soviet music. Arno Babadjanian’s piano trio of 1952 harks back to turn-of-the-century Russian romanticism, while the famous Sabre Dance from another Armenian composer, Aram Khachturian, is in the picturesque exotic vein of Soviet ballet. Next to these Rachmaninov’s gorgeously melancholic Vocalise of 1915, which rounds off the disc, doesn’t seem at all out of place. It’s an impressive release for a Trio which will surely go far. Some   of the podium can make do with directing just one of the world’s great orchestras. That’s not enough for the electrifying Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons. He’s chief conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestras and Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestras, and is now busy recording all fifteen symphonies of Shostakovich with the first, and all nine of Bruckner’s with the second. One hardly dares imagine the Air Miles he’s clocked up in the process. Some have made unflattering comparisons between the white-hot energy of the Shostakovich recordings and a certain over-relaxed quality of the Bruckner cycle. That’s certainly not my impression. The Bruckner recordings are among the best around, and this new one, a double-CD set of an early and late symphony along with the Prelude to Wagner's Meistersinger, is stunning. Bruckner’s early Second Symphony has all the hall-marks of the mature composer – lilting Viennese lyricism, spacious hymn-like melodies, and huge craggy pile-ups of brass fanfares and wheeling violin patterns suggestive of vast spaces. But the vision isn’t yet quite in focus. The patterns are often too four-square, and the big sections are set off so emphatically from each other that the music’s flow can easily become clogged. Not in this performance, where Nelsons seizes on every opportunity to relax the tempo or push it forward, which softens the edges of those granite-like blocks. And because the playing is so delicately shaded Bruckner’s rich rhythmic tangles in the second movement, where all the string parts move at a different speed, register with maximum clarity. In the much better-known and greater Eighth Symphony this rhythmic flexibility allows Nelsons to take some risks. “Solemnly, not dragging” is how Bruckner marks the second movement, and though Nelsons’s tempo is immensely slow the music never loses momentum. “Solemnly, not fast” is the marking in the Finale, but Nelsons actually takes it at a tremendous urgent pace, and by cleverly maintaining the urgency until the end – while making room for lovely lyrical digressions – he makes more sense of this huge puzzling movement than many performances I’ve heard. Wagner’s Meistersinger Prelude, like everything else on the disc, has a spacious glowing sound, with much fine-grained detail. In every way this recording is a winner. Aristocrat or bumpkin? Joseph Haydn seems to be both at once, which is a large part of his appeal. His music effortlessly straddles the class divide, just as it straddles any number of other opposites: high and low, serious and comic, transcendent and everyday. However this new recording of his radiant, wise and often mysterious set of six quartets Op 76 leans heavily towards the aristocratic. The excellent liner notes by Richard Wigmore talk constantly about the “rustic energy” of these pieces, particularly the dance movements which on the page can seem almost uncouth. But never on these recordings. Those minuets sidle into being with insinuating gracefulness, as if we’re in an aristocratic ballroom. It’s the same story in the spacious opening movements, the rapt hymn-like slow movements, and the helter-skelter finales. Everything sounds super-refined, partly because the players perform on 18th-century instruments, which make a lighter, more dancing sound. But this quartet sounds very different to other so-called “period quartets”. They tend to emphasise Haydn’s nervous energy and broad-brush humour. The London Haydn Quartet give those balanced phrases and sudden pauses a very different, tenderly expressive quality.   To achieve this the players make a much smoother sound. Not once do you hear the cheerful “bouncing bow” effect, which other period-instrument quartets use all the time. The players sometimes make a surprisingly romantic expressive droop or slide between notes, but it’s applied so fleetingly I wondered whether I was imagining it, and had to rewind the recording and re-listen just to be sure. It’s the same with vibrato, that expressive trembling quality which some period-instrument quartets banish altogether. On this recording it’s certainly there, but so subtly done I often couldn’t tell whether I was hearing vibrato or not. And in almost every bar the players pull the tempo back, or push it forward, or make the tiniest hesitation to emphasise an emphatic chord. Some listeners may miss the foot-stamping, peasant aspect of Haydn, and I did myself – for a while. But the mysterious, intimate side of these pieces burned more brightly, which more than made up for the loss. For most of the 172 years since his death, the great master of Italian early romantic opera Gaetano Donizetti was known only for a handful of masterpieces. Most of his 65 operas seemed condemned to permanent oblivion. But in recent decades many of these have been rescued, and some have turned out to be near masterpieces, almost on a par with the ones we know and love such as L’Elisir d’Amore and Lucia di Lammermoor. It’s fair to say Pietro il Grande (“Peter the Great”), a comic opera unveiled in Venice in 1820 when the composer was only 23, is not one of them. But as this DVD of the 2019 Donizetti Festival production reveals, it’s not negligible either. The master of lusciously ornate vocal melody we know from the mature operas is already fully formed, though the young Donizetti hadn’t yet found his wonderfully delicate touch as an orchestrator (and the rough-edged orchestral playing doesn’t show it off to best advantage).  But the overall Rossini-pastiche style of the opera is brilliantly done, and includes one “patter” duet that will leave you humming the tune for days. The story is every bit as silly as you’d expect. The Tsar and his wife are travelling incognito in search of his wife’s lost brother, and they pitch up in a village where a young carpenter is in love with a local belle who is pursued by a venal money-lender. Of course the carpenter turns out to be the long-lost brother, and before the inevitable happy ending there are plenty of comic imbroglios. The directing team from Ondadurto Teatro decided that a Russian-Suprematist-style production would be just the ticket for an opera set in Tsarist times, because after all the Tsar was very forward-looking. It’s one of those mad ideas that only an opera director would think of, and the costumes, which make everyone look like animated Suprematist paintings with a topping of 19th-century pomp, are eye-wateringly bad. But at least their riotous colourfulness is amusing, and the performances are equally over-the-top. Roberto de Candia as the Tsar is a weak link, but the light soprano of Nina Solodovnikova as the belle Annetta is charming. Marco Filippo Romano as the corrupt and lascivious magistrate is a treat, and there are nice cameos from Tommaso Barea as the money-lender and Stefano Gentili as the Notary. The other new Donizetti release is on an altogether different level. Premiered nine years after Pietro il Grande, Il Paria (“The Pariah”) is a tragedy about the horrors of racial and religious bigotry set in ancient India. A priestess of Brahma is in love with a military hero, who unfortunately turns out to be the son of a Pariah.  The truth is revealed at the end, and priestess, hero and the outcast father all die together, at the hand of the enraged Brahmin priests – but not before the Pariah prophesises that their laws “will be destroyed by the people of a later age”, a remarkably modern-sounding sentiment. By now Donizetti is leaving the Rossinian tradition behind and moving towards the more dramatic, continuous style of Verdi. The clash between the iron laws of duty and romantic ardour is a very Verdian theme, and there are some astonishing anticipations of Verdi’s dramatic use of harmony and colourful orchestration. So it’s a superior piece, but the care and attention to detail lavished on the recording lifts it still higher. Opera Rara is dedicated to rescuing little-known romantic operas from oblivion, and for this recording they’ve actually gone to the trouble of commissioning a new error-free edition of the music from leading Italian opera scholars. The soloists have been chosen with equal care. Donizetti wrote one of his most perilously high and athletic tenor parts for the hero Idamore, and you have to marvel at the way René Barbera tackles this high-wire act. Marko Mimica is superb as the unflinchingly vicious high priest Akebare, and Misha Kiria as Idamore’s father Zarete seems at first to be equally iron and unbending, though eventually he’s touched with a redeeming humanity. Soaring over them all, literally and metaphorically, is the tenderly flexible soprano of Albina Shagimuratova. She melts the heart of the listener as the high priestess Neala, but not alas the fiercely patriarchal culture around her. Helping the vocal soloists to shine is the intelligent and tautly disciplined playing from the Britten Sinfonia under Mark Elder, and the ardent singing of the Opera Rara Chorus. In all it’s a marvel; let’s hope it encourages an enterprising opera company to bring the piece to the stage. Musical celebrations at Versailles in the reign of Louis XIV were normally on a grand scale, as befitted the most powerful monarch in Europe. But by the end of his life Louis was getting weary of the pompous ceremonial which surrounded every aspect of his life. Le Grand Coucher – the Grand Going to Bed – was giving way to the Petit Coucher, a less onerously formal affair. Thanks to a particularly assiduous court musician named Philidor, the archives at Versailles contain a treasury of small-scale, intimate music which he copied out for these bed-time musical entertainments. Many of them are arrangements of pieces which began life on a much bigger scale somewhere else, as a ballet or dramatic scene. Using this archive, French lutenist Thibaut Roussel has gathered together a group of ten excellent young players and two singers to create an imaginary Petit Coucher on an evening in early 1713. To appreciate the seductive flavour of this disc it’s probably best until wait until bed-time, and have a hot toddy to hand. That will help you savour the strange, melancholy atmosphere of this music, designed for rooms with heavy curtains and tapestries where the sun rarely penetrates. The procession of grave pieces for the deep bass lute, beautifully played by Roussel, are interwoven with equally grave Plaintes (laments) or Preludes for a bigger but still intimate group of flutes, violin, bass viols and harpsichord. Every now and then there’s a welcome injection of energy from a suite of dances, but it doesn’t last. Mingled in with the instrumental pieces are four vocal numbers, including an amorous duet for Cleopatra and Mark Anthony sung with a perfect sense of style by mezzo-soprano Danaé Monnié and baritone Marc Mauillon (though Monnié’s vocal sound is much more tender and winning). Along with the CD there’s a DVD of the group performing in the beautiful Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, which is a treat in itself. It can’t be denied there’s a certain sameness of mood, but the mood is so extraordinary and the sounds so delicious you won’t mind. “Heavenly length” is a description often applied to Schubert’s generous musical forms, which roam through distant harmonies with leisurely ease as if the music has all the time in the world. It’s a phrase that’s apt for the two chamber pieces on a new recording released by Naxos, especially the late Piano Trio, which despite its slender forces is a big beast: the final movement is over 20 minutes long. In some performances that luxurious length, combined with the assertive, thick piano texture, can weigh heavy on the ear. That never happens in these new recordings, partly because the players perform on old instruments appropriate to the period. The Arpeggione sonata was originally written for a bowed guitar, a newly-invented instrument which enjoyed a brief vogue in Schubert’s Vienna and was later dubbed ""arpeggione"".  We normally hear it on the cello, but here Alexander Rudin performs it on an arpeggione, which is a revelation. It has a winningly transparent sound, and Schubert’s frequent ascents to the high register which can sound strenuous on a cello seem easy and natural on this instrument. Rudin’s accompanist Aapo Häkkinen plays on an early 19 -century piano that’s exactly right for the music. The delightful silvery slenderness of the fortepiano’s sound means the balance problems that often afflict this piece and the Trio simply melt away. However just as you shouldn’t blame the tools when a workman does a bad job, you shouldn’t praise them either when things turn out superbly. Aapo Häkkinen is simply a wonderful musician, who would surely sound great on a pub honky-tonk piano. He has a charming way of softening the edges of Schubert’s score with an almost improvisatory freedom, often rolling chords that most pianists play ""straight"". Alexander Rudin and violinist Erich Höbart make a sound that’s robust without ever being heavy, and all three together infuse the music with a subtle rhythmic freedom, so Schubert’s frequent repetitions never sound exactly the same. “Heavenly length,” indeed.",1

According to the   out of lockdown,   with socially distanced audiences from around May 17 (or Step 3), and with full audiences from June 21 (Step 4). Many shows, including new and returning West End productions, are already announcing their runs, and you can start booking now.  Just bear in mind that the exact reopening dates aren’t yet set in stone, so you might need to be flexible about swapping to another performance if Government plans change.

Today, it was announced that the Lyric - current home of the witty, herstory musical Six, in which the wives of Henry VIII each get their say, diva style - is definitely returning in May with 50 per cent audience capacity and social distancing. The show’s devoted fans, known as the ‘Queendom’, will give them a right royal welcome back.  Likewise, the reopening of Nimax venues means the imminent return of this homegrown hit. The show is based on a real story about a teenager who wanted to wear a dress to his school dance, and features music by The Feeling’s Dan Gillespie Sells. There’s also a film adaptation coming soon, starring Richard E Grant as the drag queen mentor. The West End stalwart is taking bookings from May 17 - one the biggest productions to potentially aim for that early reopening date - although you might be safest opting for late June onwards. Stephen Schwartz’s musical tells the ‘untold’ tale of the Witches of Oz, anchored by the opposites-attract friendship between Elphaba and Glinda. The plucky Cornish outdoor theatre was quick off the mark in 2020, and looks to repeat the feat  , with events programmed from May. They include concerts from Fishermen's Friends and Scott Matthews, play And Then Come the Nightjars, and family fare like The Further Adventures of Doctor Dolittle.  You can once again experience Agatha Christie's taut thriller in this atmospheric, site-specific production, where you really feel like you’re in the courtroom where the drama takes place. Will you find Leonard Vole innocent or guilty of murder – and can you figure out who’s telling the truth? Pit your wits against the Queen of Crime. The Globe, which missed out on its summer season last year, is welcoming audiences back – amidst Covid-safe measures like having chairs in the Yard instead of milling crowds. Artistic director Michelle Terry will play Viola in Twelfth Night, directed by Sean Holmes, while Ola Ince directs Alfred Enoch and Rebekah Murrell in Romeo & Juliet. The French Revolutionary musical returns, initially with an encore of its 2020  , and then the full production from September 25.

Amélie, based on the quirky 2001 romcom, sees the titular character improvising small acts of kindness, and finding her own chance of happiness through love. It ran at The Other Palace in 2019, and stars the Olivier-nominated Audrey Brisson, leading an actor-musician cast. The north-west London venue reopens with the Women's Prize for Playwriting 2020 winner: Reasons You Should(n't) Love Me, written and performed by Amy Trigg. That's followed by a revival of Ayad Akhtar's The Invisible Hand, directed by Indhu Rubasingham;  , Suhayla El-Bushra and Roy Williams' NW Trilogy; and The Wife of Willesden, Zadie Smith's adaptation of Chaucer’s The Wife of Bath. Fans of the Channing Tatum film franchise, and of male exotic dance, will be delighted to learn that this stage spin-off is back in action - albeit with social distancing, at least initially. This is enlightened striptease with acrobatics, knowing role play, and variety-style entertainment. For ages 18 and up. The north London venue has announced its first live productions for 2021. In the main house is Alfred Fagon's compelling and still resonant play, which tackles identity and sexual politics (from May 28). In the downstairs space is the premiere of Deborah Bruce's Raya (from June 11), set at a student reunion. The National reopens two of its spaces in June. First, on June 2, it's After Life in the Dorfman, based on the film by Hirokazu Kore-eda, written by Jack Thorne and directed by Jeremy Herrin. Then, on June 16, Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood begins in the Olivier, with Michael Sheen leading the company and Lyndsey Turner directing. The ABBA musical is still going strong, having spawned two movies and a ‘party’ spin-off at the O2 - plus a UK tour planned for January 2022, and open-air run at Harewood House in August. This sunny show doubles as a getaway, transporting you to a Greek island packed with family drama. But the story is really just an excuse for wall-to-wall pop hits that satisfy your inner dancing queen. The Original Theatre Company brings us Ben Brown’s new political drama, which sees novelist Graham Greene (played by Oliver Ford Davies) travelling to the Soviet Union in 1987 to meet his old MI6 boss, Kim Philby (Stephen Boxer). The tour begins at Malvern Festival Theatre, and the production will also be available online from April 15. Trevor Nunn directs Lisa Dwan in this 60th-anniversary production of Samuel Beckett’s play. Featuring a couple trapped together, struggling to combat the monotony of their days and understand the passing of time amidst surreal circumstances, it will likely take on new resonance post-lockdown.  Mischief Theatre's enduring farce is returning to the West End, ready to leave audiences helpless with laughter once more. The riotous comedy sees the am-dram Cornley Drama Society staging a 1920s murder mystery – but everything that can go wrong, does. Cue misplaced props, stuck doors, flubbed dialogue, injuries, and even the floor collapsing. The west London theatre reopens its doors with a triple bill of new work by Simon Stephens, Tanika Gupta and Roy Williams, exploring themes of race, identity, place and purpose. The plays will be helmed by the Lyric’s artistic director, Rachel O’Riordan, and Diane Page. This Olivier Award-winning musical tells the remarkable true story of passengers whose planes were grounded on 9/11, and the residents of a small Newfoundland town who welcomed them into their hearts and homes. It’s the best of humanity in the worst of times: the perfect post-pandemic outing.  You can’t stop the beat! Originally due to run in April 2020, this revival of the big-haired and big-hearted Sixties-set musical finally hits the stage this summer. Michael Ball is reprising his Olivier Award-winning turn as Edna Turnblad, and Paul Merton makes his West End debut as husband Wilbur. Sir Ian McKellen plays Shakespeare's prince, 50 years after he first tackled the role, and then Firs in Chekhov's Cherry Orchard, as part of a company staging both productions back to back. Also joining him are Steven Berkoff, Jenny Seagrove and Francesca Annis, directed by Sian Mathias. Beware the Trunchbull - one of the most terrifying villains in all of children’s literature. Thankfully, she has a hero to match in the form of the imaginative and magical Matilda. This RSC production captures Roald Dahl’s anarchic spirit, particularly via Tim Minchin’s mischievous songs. Mark Goucher Productions has announced two musical tours beginning in the summer. Hairspray begins in Plymouth on June 24, while Priscilla - which paused mid-run in 2020, and is co-produced by Jason Donovan - picks up its run in Cheltenham on June 23, and is aiming for a West End return.  Book for Hairspray   and Priscilla  The verdant north London venue, which managed a   of Jesus Christ Superstar last summer, is back with a full season. First up, Kimberley Sykes directs Shakespeare’s tragedy of star-crossed lovers (June 26-July 24), and then Timothy Sheader helms Rodgers and Hammerstein’s iconic musical, with choreography from Drew McOnie (July 30-September 18). There’s also Derek Bond’s interactive Dragons and Mythical Beasts for youngsters (August 10-September 5). The stage musical version of the DreamWorks animated movie features fresh songs from Oscar winner Stephen Schwartz, along with his enduring anthem When You Believe. This epic production charts Moses’ journey to free the Israelites in Ancient Egypt, while battling his adopted brother Ramses, the Pharaoh.  This family-favourite musical from Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice was revived in 2019, and - though delayed a year - Laurence Connor’s lively, contemporary production now gets a well-deserved encore run. Jac Yarrow reprises his performance in the lead role of Joseph, and Jason Donovan also returns as the Elvis-styled Pharaoh.  Previously due to run in 2020, this Nottingham Playhouse/Leeds Playhouse co-production of Pam Gems’ drama tells the extraordinary story of the world-renowned chanteuse, who went from singing on the streets to hits like La Vie en Rose and Je Ne Regrette Rien. Jenna Russell stars as Piaf, and the theatre will be transformed into a Parisian bar with cabaret-style seating. Rodgers and Hammerstein’s stirring musical is set on an archipelago in 1943, and features romance, espionage and racial prejudice - plus great songs like I’m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair, Some Enchanted Evening and There Is Nothing Like a Dame. Daniel Evans directs, and tickets are on general sale soon. The faithful stage musical version of the Julia Roberts/Richard Gere romcom is back in the West End, though transferring from the Piccadilly to the Savoy Theatre. The cast features Aimie Atkinson, Danny Mac and Rachel Wooding, with music from Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance. The raucous religious satire from South Park’s Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and Frozen’s  , is still one of the most provocative shows in the West End. It follows two mismatched Mormon missionaries who travel to Uganda in hopes of preaching to the inhabitants of a remote village, only to come up against a local warlord. The Secret Cinema organisation has   recently, first for its sizable chunk of the Culture Recovery Fund, and then again for commandeering a local park. Will its riff on the beloved Patrick Swayze/Jennifer Grey film be enough to silence detractors? You can carry your watermelon to the event this summer and find out. Andrew Lloyd Webber has led the charge on getting theatres back in action, and he’s putting his money where his mouth is with this new musical take on the classic fairy tale, starring Carrie Hope Fletcher. It promises to be a spikier version, thanks to a book from  ’s Emerald Fennell, and the Lord has already teased audiences by releasing some of the songs. The stage adaptation of David Walliams' hit children's book should prove a family favourite this summer.  It tells the story of Joe Spud, the richest boy in the country, who has everything money can buy, except a friend. The Birmingham Stage Company production comes to the West End following a UK tour. The continuation of JK Rowling’s book series is a theatrical triumph, using astonishing illusions, movement, lighting and props to conjure up her magical world. But this two-part production, directed by John Tiffany and scripted by Jack Thorne, pays just as much attention to characters and their relationships, giving audiences an engrossing - and moving - story. Lloyd Webber is also responsible for the return of the Phantom, along with a refurbished theatre and revamped production. Killian Donnelly plays the (aptly) masked man who dwells beneath the Paris Opera House and mentors the beautiful soprano Christine in secret, seducing her with his “music of the night”. Will & Grace star Megan Mullally makes her West End debut opposite Robert Lindsay in this classic Cole Porter/P. G. Wodehouse musical, which takes place on board a luxury ocean liner. Featuring romance, comic hijinks, dancing sailors and great standards like It’s De-Lovely, You’re the Top and I Get a Kick Out of You, it’s gold-plated escapism. The popular jukebox musical, which follows the turbulent journey of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons - from hit songs to band infighting and troubles with the mob - is back in the West End. The musical will open the revamped Trafalgar Theatre, which has been returned to its original heritage design with just one, larger auditorium. Julie Taymor’s inspired, child-friendly stage version of the Disney animated film returns. This creative production uses epic puppetry and special effects to evoke the African Pridelands. Add in catchy Elton John and Tim Rice songs like Circle of Life, Hakuna Matata and Can You Feel the Love Tonight, and it’s one parents can enjoy too. This glorious theatrical adaptation of the MGM Golden Age movie is back, along with former Royal Ballet principal Adam Cooper in the Gene Kelly role. A loving spoof of 1920s Hollywood being rocked by the “talkies”, it’s packed with great numbers - including that title song, accompanied by 14,000 litres of water splashed on stage every night. The Hope Mill was only able to stage five performances of Rent last autumn before lockdown struck, although the production was  . But a full theatrical run is very welcome, giving disappointed audiences another chance to see Jonathan Larson's beloved musical live and in person. Luke Shepperd directs. The stage version of the iconic sci-fi adventure movie – which sees cool 80s teenager Marty McFly transported back to 1955 via Doc Brown's time-travelling DeLorean, where he must ensure his parents fall in love – opened in Manchester in March 2020, and now gets its belated West End transfer. Expect futuristic special effects and rock 'n' roll. The long-awaited UK premiere of the Disney stage extravaganza will finally arrive in August, so get ready to build a snowman and “Let It Go”. Samantha Barks and Stephanie McKeon star as Princesses Elsa and Anna respectively. Existing ticket-holders will receive a new booking date, and tickets go back on general sale on April 15. One of the   announced for 2021 is this adaptation of Helen Forrester’s autobiography, about moving to Liverpool in the 1930s after her father went bankrupt and having to fight for her independence. All being well, it will begin at the Lowther Pavilion in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, in September and then play at 18 theatres in different towns and cities. It might seem like an impossible tale to adapt for stage, but the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield used ingenious theatrical tricks and state-of-the-art visuals to conjure a boy trapped in a lifeboat with a Royal Bengal tiger. Now, this dramatisation of Yann Martel’s Man Booker Prize-winning novel comes to the West End. Shakespeare meets 90s pop hits in this irresistible show, which allows Juliet to escape her tragic fate and embark on a new adventure instead. The score takes its songs from the stupendous back catalogue of songwriter Max Martin, who created hits for the likes of Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande. One of the great losses of the 2020 theatre programme was the thrilling prospect of Cush Jumbo playing Hamlet. Happily, the London venue has announced that the show is back on for this autumn, with the busy actress – who played Mark Anthony in the Donmar's all-female Julius Caesar – directed by her long-time collaborator Greg Hersov. This world premiere tells the story of the Jamaican superstar, honouring not just his enduring songs - like No Woman, No Cry, I Shot the Sheriff, and One Love - but also his social and political advocacy. Lee Hall has written the book, Clint Dyer directs, and Arinzé Kene plays Bob Marley. The National Theatre’s sold-out stage adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s novel gets a West End encore. This spellbinding tale features a man returning to his home town for a funeral, which sparks memories of an invasive supernatural being and the magical family who helped him to battle it. The imaginative production features skilful puppetry and illusions.  Beverley Knight stars as pioneering music manager Faye Treadwell, who led The Drifters to global fame - while battling prejudice within the industry. This new musical will feature numerous hits, such as Kissin’ in the Back Row of the Movies, and also give long-overdue attention to a legendary figure.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/best-calming-relaxing-songs-music-playlist-2021/,culture,"Songs about sleep are a pop perennial – The Beatles alone wrote four (I’m So Tired, Golden Slumbers, Good Night and I’m Only Sleeping). But often it’s the less familiar, more esoteric pieces that encourage us to switch off. And, given the current circumstances, has there ever been a greater need to listen to some calming music? Here we present 30 sleep-inducing pieces, songs and entire albums to fall asleep to. Go and hunt them down on a streaming service of your choice. The only musician to win two Mercury Prizes has never made the same album twice. She followed the glittering Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea (2001) and the grungy Uh Her Her (2004) with this ethereal, piano-driven masterpiece about spectres and ancient cliffs. The first album by Alabaman songwriter Katie Crutchfield was recorded in one weekend in her childhood bedroom. It takes “lo-fi” to a new level, with Crutchfield’s elegaic and nostalgic lyrics drifting above her steady, slow guitar. Back in 2009, a debut album of sparse, pristinely-tuned electronic pop was suddenly being played everywhere. Over a decade later, there’s still something incomparably atmospheric about XX’s blend of yearning lyrics, endless echoes and pure, single-note riffs. The American soft-rocker – and never was rock softer – sings a slate of soothing, inoffensive, laidback songs about banana pancakes, childhood sweethearts and watching the surf roll in and out. Very pleasant. There are reams of Beethoven recordings to choose from, but Kovacevich deals best with the slow, deep, pulsing chords that open the composer’s final piano sonata. It’s one of those pieces that seems as though it could ebb and flow on forever. Touted upon its release in 2011 as the “most relaxing tune ever”, Manchester trio Marconi Union’s New Age noodling was designed in collaboration with scientists for maximum, soporific capability. Peter Perrett’s broken-sounding acoustic strum-through of a Christmas classic, recorded on the fly for a Dutch radio show in 1979, is a narcotic two-minute adult lullaby. Wim Wenders asked slide-guitar virtuoso Ry Cooder to soundtrack his sun-blasted 1984 road movie, resulting in a deliciously lethargic hymn to the wide-open desert spaces of the US south. Since 2001 Cologne label Kompakt have annually released their soothing downtempo Pop Ambient collections. This one heavily features Klimek, who aptly later created an album called Music To Fall Asleep. In 1982 brothers Norman and Ralston Grant, having moved from Jamaica to London, produced the first volume of their Dub Massacr’ series, deconstructing reggae into some very spaced-out territory. US producer Fred Gianelli is best known for pioneering industrial techno in the early 1990s, but in 2007 he produced a 10-minute, mesmerising didgeridoo odyssey. Hip-hop isn’t usually soporific music, but Texan rapper Devin Copeland’s 2002 album turns the drawled Southern style into something slow and somniferous, offering a stoned disregard for gangsta posing. The output of Californian alt-rockers Mazzy Star was often described as “dream pop”. Their second album, featuring their best-known song, Into Dust, emanates a rich indolence throughout. The second volume of electronic maverick Richard James’s Selected Ambient Works, released in 1994 and shorn of its predecessor’s percussion, is utterly slumber-inducing. Ravel’s 1922 tribute to his beloved professor at the Paris Conservatoire remains a lesson in elegiac piano and violin interaction, and it’s beautifully handled by Dumay and Pires. Although short, it’s a deeply nocturnal alternative to Brahms’s lullaby Wiegenlied. The millennial debut album from Icelandic collective Múm features sweet female vocals amid a desolate, glitchy soundscape. It has the quiet, eerie beauty of a land where the sun never rises during winter. In February 1990, chart-topping rave mischief-makers the KLF invented the concept of ‘chill-out’ with a drifting, bucolic sampling adventure that runs the gamut from freight-trains to Tuvan throaty-singing. German jazz quartet Bohren & Der Club of Gore slow jazz down and create a genre that defies description. This 1995 album reinvents it as a narcoleptic soundtrack to empty nightclubs at dawn. In 2015, on behalf of a child-poverty charity, the great American character actor launched a website that offers a plethora of night music. His soothing voice echoes amid pleasantly mind-anaesthetising drones. Sterling Holloway was a staple Disney voice-actor for three decades, but perhaps his greatest moment is as The Jungle Book’s python Kaa, attempting to hypnotise Mowgli into an eternal snooze. Satie’s short, mellow pieces are a massage for sedentary senses – they have been much-recorded but Parisian pianist and Satie aficionado Anne Queffélec’s 2005 collection captures them best. Released in 1992, and coming in at 39 minutes and 57 seconds, Blue Room is the longest single ever to hit the UK charts (40 minutes would have made it an album). It is also a superbly calibrated bubbling dub balm. The melancholic final album from cult early Seventies singer-songwriter Nick Drake is a thing of Spartan stillness and quietude. Melancholic: Nick Drake's Pink Moon was the last album by the singer-songwriter, who died young at 26. BBC Radiophonic Workshop genius Delia Derbyshire and writer-composer Barry Bermange produced this extraordinary 40-minute musical mélange of people relating their dreams, first broadcast on Radio 3 in 1964. In the early 1980s, Californian composer Robert Rich gave night-long concerts for people to sleep to; this recording from 2001 offers the listener the same experience at home.  Occasional bursts of full-bodied guitar riffing have not stopped Pink Floyd’s multi-million-selling 1973 classic becoming the preferred dozing music for generations of rock fans.  Brian Eno released a number of influential ambient classics in the 1970s, but this hour-long textural journey from 1985, originally designed to accompany video art, may be the most somnolent of them all. MGM’s 1958 children’s musical film has a standout sequence where the animated “yawning man”, voiced by American entertainer Stan Freberg, performs a song that it’s impossible to hear without feeling drowsy. Fleetwood Mac’s original guitarist, Peter Green, a blues prodigy, created this chart-topping instrumental in 1968 and it has rightly remained a musical blueprint for a blissed-out drift into dreamland ever since. Mat Jarvis is a British computer buff intrigued by the interface between music, space travel and astronomy, and his 1995 debut album floats utterly free, a reverie capable of bringing the sandman to one and all.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/brit-awards-nominations-2021-dua-lipa-arlo-parks-celeste-lead/,culture,"For the first time in Brit Awards history, four out of five nominations for Best Album are female, a brilliant turnaround from last year's heavily male-dominated Brit Awards, in which the Best Album category was exclusively male.  In fact, this year's nominees are some of the most diverse we've ever seen, with electronic wizards Bicep brushing up against soulful poet   and rappers Yung T & Bugsey in the Breakthrough Artist category, while house DJ Joel Corry, provocative punkster   and drill star   are all up for British Male Solo Artist. It's a wonderful testament to how varied and inclusive the UK mainstream has become, with no genre left out in the cold. Even rockers get a look in, with   and Fontaines DC going head to head in International Group, and The 1975 in British Group. Leading the charge with the most nominations are Arlo Parks, last year's Brit Award-winning rising star  , Joel Corry,  , and Yung T & Bugsey, each with three nominations to their name. Parks, a breakout singer from south London whose contemplative album on love, body image and anxiety Collapsed in Sunbeams shot to Number Three in the charts is a firm favourite, as is Dua Lipa, whose disco-fuelled album Future Nostalgia provided glittering relief from the sludge and trudge of lockdown last year.  It's no surprise, then, that Lipa has been chosen as one of the two performers on the night of the Brit Awards – her Future Nostalgia live stream in December being one of the most successful of the pandemic, with a record-breaking five million views. The event's second performer will be the recipient of the Rising Star Award: 20-year-old pop star Griff, who produces almost all of her own music, and her own clothes, from her bedroom.  The event will be taking place on May 11 at the O2, hosted – as always – by Jack Whitehall and broadcast live on ITV.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/politically-correct-sitcom-tv-offensive/,culture,"People are angry at Chuck Lorre. And for once it has nothing to do with  . Lorre’s cheesy nerd “comedy” – the humour was an acquired taste in the way a hernia is an acquired taste –  had half the world in hackles for a decade. But network television’s most powerful producer has moved on – to offending social media via an upcoming sitcom about the experiences of Afghan interpreters who have relocated to the United States.  Diversity, the fall-out from America’s long war in the Middle East, charges of cultural appropriation and gags courtesy of the guy who made  the best paid man on TV (with Two and a Half Men)…It was always going to be an unstable concoction. Just how unstable was made horribly clear when the trailer for the United States of Al debuted on CBS at the weekend.  “White saviour,” said some on Twitter after the preview of the show showed an “Afghan” character who has relocated to the US under Washington’s Special Immigrant Visa programme (SIV) and is living with a white US marine. “To see an American soldier hosting an Afghan [war interpreter] in the US and letting him live with his family does romanticise forces which killed, tortured, and unlawfully imprisoned thousands of Afghan civilians,” added another commentator. “Very disappointing from you.” Other criticisms centred on the fact that the lead character of Awalmir – “Al” – is played by Adhir Kalyan, who is of South Asian descent and was born in South Africa. “Finally, a groundbreaking show that will help Americans understand the plight of Indian actors playing magical Afghans to hunky gentle white supermodel saviours who are “tired from war because there is so much walking”,” activist Rafael Shimunov tweeted. And yet to paint Lorre as a perpetrator of the white saviour myth and eraser of cultural identity is arguably wide of the mark. The Big Bang Theory gave a starring role to Indian-American actor Kunal Nayyar – making it 1,000 per cent more diverse than Friends, Alan Partridge, Ricky Gervais’s The Office combined. Lorre, moreover, went out of his way to recruit a writer with a Nigerian background for his CBS show, Bob Hearts Abishola. He cold-called and hired Nigerian-British writer and comedian Gina Yashere after seeing her on YouTube –giving her the sort of opportunity she had never been afforded in the UK.  “So, originally, I was brought on as a consultant on all things African. It sounded weird to me,” Yashere told Insider, recounting her first meeting with Lorre. “Once I got in the room with the guys, I began to really like them. I could see that they were trying to make a really good show, and it wasn't really an exploitative thing.” He has also confronted the entrenched ageism of Hollywood with his Netflix hit the Kominsky Method, starring septuagenarians Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin.  And he has been one of the few senior executives in network TV to speak out about the importance of representation and of bringing a perspective to comedy that goes beyond the traditional white one. You can argue he has done so in incredibly broad and creaky fashion. But it is difficult to question his good intentions.  “You recognise your own blind spots, if you’re paying attention. You recognise your inclination is to surround yourself with more of you — people that reflect you and reflect your background. And that in and of itself is destructive and you don’t recognise it until you’re shown an alternative way of doing things,” is how Lorre outlined his philosophy towards representation in an interview with the LA Times last year.  “So it’s still a learning process. I’ve not stopped learning how to do this and not just the writing and the production and the editing and all the minutiae of making a television show. But the people you work with, that door [into industry positions] has to be much wider,” he continued.  “At a certain point, you realise you have responsibility to create a more welcoming environment and make it possible for a broader spectrum of writing viewpoints, bringing different experiences into the process, so it’s not all Long Island Jews in the room.” None of which is to suggest the United States of Al may not be problematic. The name certainly has issues: is it ever appropriate to shorten “Awalmir” to Al? And there is always the danger of rendering a member of a minority as “the other”, or milking their “exotic” background for laughs. If that is the case, Twitter criticism will have of course been vindicated.  But it feels significant that the pushback against these attacks have come not from Lorre but from the series’s Tehran-born executive producer, the academic and journalist Reza Aslan, whose CV includes the Secret Life of Muslims and The Leftovers.  This isn’t the first Twitter flap in which Aslan has been embroiled. He stood up to the narrow-mindedness of Fox News in a 2013 viral interview in which the interviewer asked how Aslan, a Muslim, could write a book about Jesus. “I am a scholar of religions with four degrees, including one in the New Testament, and fluency in biblical Greek, who has been studying the origins of Christianity for two decades, who also just happens to be a Muslim,” he said. “It's not that I'm just some Muslim writing about Jesus,"" he continued. ""I am an expert with a PhD in the history of religions.” He has, it is true, been caught up in previous controversies. His CNN series Believer With Reza Aslan drew charges of sensationalism after a scene in which, participating in a religious ceremony with India’s nomadic Aghori sect, he nibbled on human brain. “Want to know what a dead guy’s brain tastes like?” he later wrote on Facebook. “Charcoal. It was burnt to a crisp!"" The Aghori are Hindu and the segment was accused of misrepresenting the religion. “With multiple reports of hate-fuelled attacks against people of Indian origin from across the US, the show characterises Hinduism as cannibalistic, which is a bizarre way of looking at the third largest religion in the world,” said the lobby group US India Political Action Committees.  “It is unbelievably callous and reckless of CNN to be pushing sensational and grotesque images of bearded brown men and their morbid and deathly religion at a time when the United States is living through a period of unprecedented concern and fear,” added Vamsee Juluri, a media studies professor from the University of California, in a Huffington Post article.  Aslan has come out swinging in his defence of the United States of Al, pointing out that those rushing to condemn the series were doing so on the basis of a trailer. “You can’t judge a show by a 30 sec trailer,” he said on social media. “Well, you shouldn’t, at least. Still this is Twitter...” “I’m just ok with your opinion,” he continued. “Just wish it was based on facts not feels. I get it. My whole life I’ve been misrepresented on TV. That’s why I came to Hollywood to change that. You don’t have to support the effort. But maybe watch it then s— on it not other way round.” He also insisted the producers had worked hard at casting an Afghan lead. “There are five Afghan characters in the show and four of them are played by Afghans. We saw 100 Afghan leads but sitcom is a specialised genre and it’s very tough to play. But we also have four Afghan writers/producers on the show who’ve done a great job helping Adhir.” As he says, the United States of Al is diverse behind the scenes; certainly on paper it appears nothing but well-intentioned and has the ingredients of the most politically correct sitcom ever seen on US primetime TV. Among the four people from Afghanistan in the writers’ room, is a former interpreter who came to the US on a Fulbright scholarship. It will also touch on taboos such as PTSD. “I get it we are all traumatised but sometimes it's best not to shoot first and ask questions later,” tweeted Mayhad Tousi, an executive producer alongside Aslan. “The show works hand in hand with two organisations – No One Left Behind and International Refugee Assistance Project – to make sure we aren't just talking about SIV program and the plight of Afghan interpreters,” added Aslan. “We are trying to do something about it. Actually changing policy.” The United States of Al arrives at a timely moment, with the Trump White House accused of “closing the door” on Iraqi translators who worked with US forces and are seeking visas to the US. In 2019 one translator, Shaker Jeffrey, said delays to the SIV programme had put him in danger from Islamic fundamentalists.  “I am a hunted man,"" Jeffrey, who had been waiting for a visa for 10 years, told NBC from Germany. “If I return to Iraq, I will be assassinated.” The figures are chilling. In 2016, 325 Iraqi translators received SIV visas. By 2018, the figure had dropped to two. “It remains unclear why the number of visas issued to Iraqi interpreters has declined so dramatically, said NBC “But refugee advocates and lawmakers say it appears to be a case of collateral damage from the Trump administration's overall crackdown on immigration and refugees. As to the “white saviour” premise of an Afghan interpreter living with a US marine  – this was based on reality, Aslan continued. “You are literally talking about a true story. There are dozens and dozens of Afghan interpreters living with US soldiers. We know cause we actually spoke to them. This is literally their story.” Critics will point out that Aslan would of course defend his show; and the jury is still out on whether he and Lorre have been able to strike the correct tone. All will be revealed on April 1 when the United States of Al debuts.  One thing that is certain, however, is that the producers may want to stay off Twitter for the time being. Lorre might be about to be caught up in the biggest controversy since Charlie Sheen went full “tiger blood” on him 10 years ago. ",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2021/03/19/red-nose-day-comic-relief-2021-review-highlights-james-bond/,culture,"The biennial red-nosed entertainment extravaganza was back, now in its 36th year. Funds were raised for worthy causes with a night of BBC programming, filled with comedy sketches, musical performances, live studio surprises and inspiringly weepy stories. Last year, its sister fundraising push   raised £40.5 million. The previous   fundraiser in 2019 reached a total of £63 million by the end of the evening. Could this telethon exceed those totals? It appeared likely. Would anyone hop into a bath of baked beans like ye olde charidee days? It appeared unlikely. Spoilsports. Here are all the best bits, worst bits and talking points from Comic Relief 2021. The name’s Nan… Catherine Tate’s Nan. The night’s standout sketch saw 007 meet 0075. Tate’s potty-mouthed pensioner was cleaning at MI6 HQ and took an unexpected call from Daniel Craig’s dapper spy while cleaning M's office. She poked fun at Bond for being “a confirmed bachelor” who was “well-turned out, very particular” and partial to sipping cocktails from small glasses. She tutted about the BBC licence fee (“150 sovs, what a nerve”). She took the globe-trotting secret agent to task over his hefty carbon footprint.  “Do yourself a favour,” Nan told him. “Wind your money-wasting-earth-burning-Speedo-wearing-leading-lady-killing-sexiest-man-alive-no-one-believes-you’re-53-makes-us-all-look-bad neck in.”  There was only really one reply. With relish, Bond signed off with: “What a f***ing liberty."" Ian Fleming would surely approve. Dawn French’s much-loved comedy cleric Reverend Geraldine Granger  during last year’s “Zoom sermon” specials, which caused something of an ecclesiastical culture war kerfuffle.  Thankfully there was less controversy-baiting here as she appeared alongside real-life vicar Kate Bottley for a sort-of-musical sketch to open the show. The two women of the cloth donned sequin-spangled vestments to enthusiastically lip sync to Juice by Lizzo.  There were Toblerone props. There were synchronised dance moves. There was some trademark Dawn French face-pulling. It felt a little throwaway (was Richard Curtis too busy raising money to write a proper script?) but jolly enough. “Bless ye for watching,” as they concluded. Appearing on British TV for the first time in five years, Canadian pop brat Justin Bieber treated the nation’s “Beliebers” to an exclusive performance of his new single Hold On. All very well, but he might've had a wash, removed his baseball cap and smartened up a bit. What do you mean, I sound old? Other musical performances came from Gabrielle (jazzy) and the cast of Back to the Future: The Musical (decent script, cheesy tunes). “‘Where we’re going, which is into lockdown, we don’t need roads.” Comic Matt Lucas impersonated Take That’s Gary Barlow to croon a duet with the real thing.  Another segment found five comedy types trying their hand at opera. Mentored by soprano Charlotte Church, they performed classic Turandot aria Nessun Dorma live in the studio after a mere 24 hours rehearsal. Caroline Quentin and Jayde Adams were especially strong. Fireworks went off. Memories of Italia ’90 flooded back. Yet all the above were ultimately upstaged by bespectacled twins from Fife. A powerful montage of key workers and pandemic pensioners (including the late Captain Sir Tom Moore) was soundtracked by a lighters-in-the-air live rendition of The Proclaimers’ ballad Sunshine On Leith. The VT ended on a note of hope with vaccine jabs and loved ones reunited. When it cut back to presenter David Tennant, his voice cracked with emotion. I doubt he was alone.  One of the more amusing sketches was a spoof trailer for “the biggest blockbuster never made” - a disaster film about last year, populated by our lockdown superheroes. “Let's hope there won’t be a sequel,” went the tagline.  The starry cast included Russell Brand as body coach Joe Wicks, Ainsley Harriott as child-feeding footballer Marcus Rashford, Anna Friel as the first woman to cut her own hair, Keira Knightley and Carey Mulligan as mothers who’d had enough of home-schooling, and Sanjeev Bhaskar as Professor Chris Whitty’s “next slide please” guy “Barry from EastEnders” appeared as the man who invented Zoom. “I’m ready for my vaccine now, Mr DeMille,” purred the mighty Joan Collins.  All very well-observed - apart from the Doctor Who-meets-Casualty bit, where they seemed to think that Bake Off aired on Thursdays. Hey, I suppose a Timelord can watch it whichever night she chooses.  Michael Sheen and David Tennant's luvvies-in-lockdown comedy was one of the few successes of Covid-19 programming. Fresh from its second series, the pair reunited (virtually, of course) for a special historical skit, set during a whole different plague in 1592. Tennant played William Shakespeare, Sheen was Christopher Marlowe. Both wore ruffs, cloaks and tights. The pair bickered wittily over whether people wanted social realism from their playwright-poets or “escapism, maybe something with a donkey.” That is, until guest star Lenny Henry gatecrashed the call to remind them they were actors, not writers. It was as tightly written, tongue-in-cheek and whiskery as we’ve come to expect. “I’ve got an alphabet grenade. If that goes off, it could spell disaster.”  One of the night’s daftest yet most irresistibly funny skits was by one of its least starry names: stand-up comic Tim “brother of Jeremy Vine”.  Dispatched to a kiosk at RAF Northolt, “the lieutenant of laughter in a box” told quickfire jokes to servicemen and women. By my count, Vine cracked 28 gags in two minutes.  It was splendidly silly, old-school fun which sweetly reduced the military heroes to giggles. “I went to the doctor and he told me: ‘You’ve got hypochondria.’ I said: ‘Not that as well.’” Millennials must have been throwing their avocado lattés into the air with delight during a mash-up between the stars of BBC Three’s biggest hits, Normal People and Fleabag. Filmed under Covid restrictions in a London church, a seven-minute skit saw the unnamed Hot Priest from Fleabag (Andrew Scott) get two unexpected visitors in his confessional booth: Normal People’s tongue-tied young lovers Connell (Paul Mescal) and Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones).  They poked fun at themselves in a playful but oddly poignant exchange which involved Connell’s silver chain necklace and a Boyzone-meets-Tracy Chapman croon-along which showcased the trio’s unexpectedly gorgeous singing voices.  Admittedly, this wasn’t an original skit. It first aired on Ireland’s RTE Does Comic Relief last summer. Yet this meeting of two yoof TV phenomena was still a huge treat. At least for the few who hadn’t already enjoyed it on YouTube over the past nine months.  The main three-hour show was helmed by a socially distanced quintet. The hosting tagteam comprised Sir Lenny Henry (elder statesmanlike), Davina McCall (giggly), Paddy McGuinness (cheeky), Alesha Dixon (kept fluffing her lines) and David Tennant (who appeared to have time-travelled from a Seventies menswear catalogue). Tennant was comfortably the pick of the bunch. He switched gears deftly between witticisms and charitable sincerity. He was palpably proud to be there, becoming choked up by the public’s pluck and generosity of spirit. Sure, he’s a luvvie but he’s a lovely one.  At 10pm, the action switched to BBC Two for a Comic Relief-themed edition of live music stalwart Later With Jools Holland. It saw Lenny Henry popping up again - there truly was no escape from the Dudley-born funnyman - to pick his favourite musical moments from Comic Relief and Later history.  It proved an infectious trawl through the archives. His eclectic selection took in everything from Tom Jones to Dizzee Rascal, Supergrass to the Spice Girls, George Clinton to Kate Bush. Sir Lenworth reminisced about his parents’ record collection, paid fond tribute to the late Amy Winehouse, and raved passionately about funk, rap and reggae. He even kept Holland’s boogie-woogie piano-playing to a minimum, which was nice. We probably didn’t need yet another attempt at Zoom-based comedy. Nor reminding of the soul-crushing inanity of virtual meetings. But the BBC, in their bountiful wisdom, still seem to think we do. Hence well-spoken funnyman Jack Whitehall hosted a VIP videocall to thank everyone who’d made a donation.  The cast was head-turningly high-calibre, with Hugh Grant, Olivia Colman, Anya Taylor-Joy, James Corden, Idris Elba, Emma Thompson and Coldplay’s Chris Martin all logging on. The dull, stilted script was less impressive.  Viewers were desperately praying for Handforth parish council heroine Jackie Weaver to take control. I’d happily give her the authority.  Rather randomly, the husky Welsh diva’s 1983 hit Total Eclipse of the Heart got back-to-back airings. It not only appeared in Jack Whitehall’s Zoom sketch but a parody version was promptly crooned live in the studio by lockdown viral sensations, the Marsh family from Faversham.  A running order bungle rather than deliberate ploy. La Tyler will welcome the royalties and exposure nonetheless. Turn around, bright eyes. And please give generously if you can.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/architecture/do-love-hate-flag-welcome-long-running-artistic-controversy/,culture,"We live in a world of practically infinite symbols, logos, icons and avatars. And yet flags remain curiously resistant to becoming just another sign among many. A new edict from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport states that Government buildings should fly the   on a daily basis. Is that flag a little sop, in cloth form, to patriots? Or is it an airborne blind, behind which to hide an increasingly authoritarian Covid regime? Whatever the Government’s motives, we can take a step back from the political grind, and look to the symbolic: in the art world, the meaning of these strips of cloth has long been hotly contested. Last autumn, a group of artists in New Zealand called Mercy Pictures hosted a show, at a gallery of the same name, entitled People of Colour. The show consisted of hundreds of pictures of small painted flags (not the flags themselves) representing multiple countries, groups, organisations, identities, fictional places and projects. I was asked by the artists to write a short text about flags, which I was happy to do. I thought the show sounded interesting: what would be the effect of having representations of all these different flags alongside one another? Would their individual meaning be heightened or diminished? What might we learn about tribalism and belonging? What effect does removing symbols from their political context tell us about how art might tackle questions of belonging, nationhood and the symbolic realm as such? Somewhat predictably, in this era of manufactured outrage, the artists (and I, for that matter, despite having no role in the idea for the show) were accused of causing “great offense” because paintings of Nazi and white supremacist flags were included alongside paintings of Maori flags. The gallery was vandalised, and anyone who had anything to do with the show was pilloried, insulted and attacked, despite no one involved being any more a member of the far-Right than they were part of the UN Blue Helmets, or a resident of Narnia. As the writer James Robb neatly summarised it: “The provocative juxtaposition of the flags was the point of the show, raising questions about the symbolism and emotions human beings invest in flags, and the sensitivities, misunderstandings and offence caused when other people have different attitudes to a flag.” More recently, another flag show Down Under caused similar “upset”. Tasmania’s Dark Mofo festival pulled a piece titled Union Flag by the well-respected Spanish artist Santiago Sierra. The work, which consists of a Union Flag soaked in the freely-donated blood of people from colonised territories, is bluntly, but very obviously, addressing questions of history, violence, occupation and exploitation. But Santiago is Spanish, and therefore, according to the work’s detractors, somehow on the side of the coloniser, and thus the work must go. This logic is so racist it defies belief: no one who has ever been a member of a country that has ever committed violence – and let’s face it, there are virtually no states for which this is the case – can occupy a critical role in relation to their country’s past. How is history supposed to progress if all human beings are atavistic, and no one can ever do anything but represent their own tribe, however made-up that belong might be? What happened to our dreams of universalism and internationalism? Today’s identitarian logic allows no other kinds of collective being; you might think that we’re united in being human, but that’s Enlightenment reasoning, and therefore forbidden. We are almost all united as workers, but then we’re forcibly divided by race and sexual identity. It used to be understood that this kind of division best served those in power, but today consumerist and atomised distinctions rule. Even though First Nations donors gladly participated in Sierra’s project, their desire counts for nothing: art today, his detractors imply, can only be understood on the most literal level, and audiences must be protected from having to think too much. By that logic, fiction might as well be banned, and all cultural expression be strictly in accordance with the “identity” of the artist. If anyone is offended, anywhere, by anything, or pretends to be, everything is off! This is art as a mere extension of the worst kind of politics. But a brief glimpse backwards tells a more complex story of art and flags. Previously, it wasn’t literalists attempting to out-compete one another for the purest reason to cancel work, but rather conservatives reacting negatively to perceived desecration of the flag. Jasper Johns’s Flag (1955), for instance, like Mercy Pictures’ show, plays with the gap between a “real” and a “painted” flag; as with all the flag-based works Johns has made since, of which there are over a hundred, Flag remains enigmatic. More controversial was Dread Scott’s 1988 work, What is the Proper Way to Display a US Flag?, displayed in Chicago. Here, visitors had to decide whether to step on an American flag laid out on the floor, in order to answer the question posed by the title of the work in a ledger-book that sat on a shelf above it. President George HW Bush declared the work “disgraceful”, and the entire US Congress denounced it, voting in the Senate 97-0 to outlaw any placing of the Stars and Stripes on the ground anywhere at all. (Two years later, that law was ruled unconstitutional.) Scott’s work skilfully plays with context: does a flag belong in an art gallery at all? What distinguishes a flag from any other piece of material? What does desecration mean in a secular age? Has nationalism replaced religion? Flag-fear never seems to disappear. One way of removing their sting would be to see all flags as more or less equally empty: tribalism could be undermined in the name of a more light-hearted, humorous collective being that didn’t need any kind of flag at all. For a year or so, the UK has been drenched in rainbow flags, formerly (and still) the pennant of Gay Pride, its meaning expanded to represent the NHS and the “hope” that one day this pandemic will be over.  Many months later, it is revealing that the Government wants to bring back the Union Flag. This move is not really about patriotism, either for or against, though any distracting culture war can only be useful for those in authority. It is, in fact, more about creating a sense of fake unity against the enemy-virus. But Britain is genuinely divided, as a supposedly freedom-loving Government becomes increasingly authoritarian. People would like their lives back. As the issue of flags shows all too clearly, the censorship of art by the Left is often the mirror of tyranny from the Right.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/tv-comedy-needs-stop-cruel-remember-kindness-classic-sitcoms/,culture,"“Gentle” is a warm and wonderful adjective. It’s what we crave from a touch or a reminder: something kind, light, amiable, free from harshness or violence. So why, when a comedy is described as “gentle” today, does it often sound dismissive, even derogatory? I’ve been writing radio and television comedy for nearly 35 years. Initially, if critics, broadcasters or friends described any of my comedies as “gentle”, I was miffed. But that isn’t the case any more. Great comedy is often challenging, and sometimes that means cruel. Take, for instance, The Thick of It, where strings of joined-up expletives are hurled by characters who appear to hate each other. Or crude, like   or  , full of what my grandmother used to call “unparliamentary language” and puerile jokes. It doesn’t mean they’re not funny, but it does mean that they exclude a large swathe of the viewing public who prefer their comedy with less vulgarity and more wit. Gentle comedy, by contrast, is defined by kindness. Yes, the characters may bicker but there is love and affection. In the last year, stuck indoors under the same roof, we’ve wanted TV shows the whole family can enjoy without someone being embarrassed or appalled. And nostalgia has proved the way forward. Channel 5 whisked the new  l out from under the BBC’s nose; niche TV channels such as Talking Pictures and Forces TV spotted the need for a “comfort watch” and streamed vintage comedy, including Rumpole of the Bailey and my own long-running series Second Thoughts. Another hit, , conveyed a feelgood likeability in its recognisable depiction of the shorthand and warmth of long friendships. It isn’t even a scripted comedy: it’s an eavesdrop on two old friends, each recovering from serious health problems, talking and laughing, while one teaches the other to fish. We want to be by the river with them. We want to be their friend. Each generation has a “marker” comedy and can recite whole scenes from their favourites, whether it’s  ,  ,  ,  , anything written by  ,   films or . When I was young, we’d quote whole chunks of radio’s   on the school bus. The characters we love best have a vulnerability, visible through their bluster. My favourite line from Galton and Simpson’s   is when, as chairman of the jury, his ignorant but hilarious summing-up begins: “Magna Carta! Did she die in vain?” He is like Captain Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) in   and David Brent ( ) in The Office: these characters see themselves very differently from how the world sees them. When, in The Good Life, that uber-snob Margo reads aloud a Christmas-cracker joke – “the Ooh Aah bird is so called because it lays square eggs” – her husband Jerry and neighbours Barbara and Tom fall on the floor laughing, but Margo is almost tearful: “Why is that funny, Tom?” Even if the characters are not related, there’s often a “family” element. In Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais’s sitcom  , the old lag Fletcher (Ronnie Barker) keeps a protective, fatherly eye on his younger cellmate, Godber (Richard Beckinsale). “Next year, Rodders, we’ll be millionaires,” the ever-optimistic Del Boy tells his brother in John Sullivan’s   but then Grandad whacks the wrong bolt and the chandelier crashes to the ground. Both those writers invented swear-word substitutes – “scrote”, “naff off” and “plonker” – and reached a much wider audience. In comedy, accidents and disasters happen far more frequently than in real life – and are miraculously resolved or forgiven by the episode’s end. No matter how many times we watch  , Victor Meldrew will pick up a dachshund instead of a phone. We know what’s coming, but it makes us laugh every time, often because we recognise the characters’ traits: “He/She is just like my mum/my boss/my best friend!” In The Canterbury Tales, Chaucer was conveying nobility and strength – not soppy weakness – when he described a “verray parfit gentil knyght”. Gentle comedies can be quietly strong, too. Their audience may not even realise that the writer has addressed serious issues such as class and prejudice with humour, as in the ground-breaking Goodness Gracious Me’s great line, “Going out for an English”. Across more than 200 TV and radio comedy scripts, I’ve tackled everything from bullying, anorexia and adultery to ageing, the menopause, heartbreak and death. Of course, comedy is never “one size fits all”. One day we fancy the slapstick mayhem of The Young Ones; another, the marital tension of Ever Decreasing Circles. In turn, we expect our broadcasters to offer us a kaleidoscope of comedy experiences. In the mid-1990s, I told the BBC’s then-head of TV comedy about my latest idea for a series: “Next of Kin is about grandparents bringing up their orphaned grandchildren.” After a few moments’ thought, he replied: “I’ll have six.” Twenty-five years later, that decisive autonomy and creative confidence has given way to algorithms. I’ve heard “what we’re looking for” edicts and buzzwords such as “noisy”, “cut-through” and “edgy”. The comedy commissioning landscape is now like a “webinar” from John Morton’s sublime comedy about BBC management,  . Thank goodness, then, for radio, the birthplace of a great variety of comedy from The Navy Lark and Round the Horne to After Henry and Ed Reardon’s Week. I had wanted to write a comedy for   ever since I saw her in 2005’s lovely, languid BBC Two series, Sensitive Skin, in which she played a restless wife, unwillingly relocating to the city with her husband (Denis Lawson). So for Radio 4, I wrote Conversations from a Long Marriage for her and Roger Allam, about a couple who met in the Summer of Love but – unlike in so many tetchy and toxic marital series – still love, respect and fancy each other. I’m now writing series three – and, yes, I’m happy if you call it “gentle”.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/artists/deaccessioning-museums-selling-valuable-treasures/,culture,"How can museums survive the financial apocalypse brought about by the pandemic? Last summer, the popular Canadian journalist   suggested a fix. In an episode of his Revisionist History podcast, he asked: why do big institutions cry “help!”, and complain about deficits, but refuse to sell their treasures to drum up cash? The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, for instance, has more than 1.5 million objects, mostly held in storage. “All they would have to do is pick a couple of things off the shelf [and sell them], and they would never see a deficit again.” Fast-forward to today, and it seems that Max Hollein, the director of the Met, who heard Gladwell’s podcast, was swayed. Recently he announced a controversial change in policy regarding “deaccessioning”, as selling objects from museum collections is known. But deaccessioning is not the silver bullet Gladwell would have us believe. Indeed, his argument turns out, on reflection, to be simplistic and misleading. As it happens, museums in America (unlike Europe) regularly deaccession objects, and have done so for decades. Typically, they follow strict protocols, such as offloading duplicates, or hanging onto recent donations and works by living artists. Moreover, proceeds are ring-fenced for future acquisitions. As with a garden, you occasionally need to chop down dead wood, but then you plant something new. Today’s controversy stems from last spring, when, in light of the pandemic, the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD) – the sector’s de facto watchdog in the US –  d its deaccessioning guidelines. Until April 2022, it announced, it would refrain from punishing institutions that sold art “to pay for expenses associated with the direct care of collections”. In other words, American museums were given a two-year window to cover operational costs by flogging stuff they owned. This may seem esoteric, but, for many observers, it was potentially a line-crossing moment. After all, “collection care” is vague. Curators’ pay: surely legitimate. But what about, say, a leaking roof? Moreover, if deaccessioning becomes the norm, won’t potential donors be less likely to gift things in the future? So far, several museums have taken advantage. For instance, New York’s Brooklyn Museum has raised almost $35 million by auctioning off works including a Lucretia by Lucas Cranach the Elder and a Monet landscape. Meanwhile, the Baltimore Museum of Art, which had hoped to raise $65  million by privately selling a Last Supper by Andy Warhol and auctioning its only paintings by Brice Marden and Clyfford Still, only changed tack at the last minute, after two former board chairmen reportedly threatened to rescind $50 million in promised donations. In February, though, when Hollein announced that the Met would also consider deaccessioning to fund “collection care” (he was facing a revenue loss of $150 million), all hell broke loose. His predecessor, Thomas P Campbell, now in charge of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, denounced the move on Instagram: “Deaccessioning will be like crack cocaine to the addict – a rapid hit that becomes a dependency.” Writing in Apollo magazine, he added: “The AAMD has acted with the best of intentions, but opened a Pandora’s box… I fear these institutions will face increasing pressure to monetise their most valuable works.” Yet, for Hollein, who spoke to me recently over Zoom, the “slippery-slope” argument is an overreaction. He says that suspending the AAMD’s guidelines – a move Campbell worries could become permanent – is a “temporary measure”. In a typical year, Hollein explains, the Met raises around $15 million from deaccessioning, which goes towards new acquisitions – on top of another $50 million, from restricted endowments, earmarked for the same purpose. Given the crisis, it is reasonable, he suggests, to temporarily divert this $15 million to staff salaries – especially when, thanks to those endowments, he still has tens of millions of dollars at his disposal to grow the collection. Moreover, he insists, the Met has no intention of cashing in on major works: “We would never sell a Michelangelo, or whatever… It’s not as if the collection is being drained.” He points out that much of the collection is held in storage because it includes more than 1.3 million fragile, light-sensitive photographs and works on paper, and rejects the argument that, instead of sanctioning deaccessioning, the museum’s billionaire trustees should themselves be giving more. “We have a super-generous board,” he tells me. Still, what works for the Met will not suit other institutions – especially in Britain, where the culture regarding deaccessioning is very different. The British Museum, for instance, boasts a collection of around eight million objects. Only 53,000 are ever on display in Bloomsbury (though thousands more are usually on loan elsewhere) – but the British Museum Act forbids trustees from getting rid of any object unless it duplicates another, is damaged, or deemed “unfit to be retained”. (Exceptions are also made for certain types of objects such as human remains.) According to the museum’s policy, “the trustees… do not normally deaccession objects”. It’s a similar story at the National Gallery, though admittedly its collection of around 2,300 paintings is considerably smaller. While it has a policy governing “disposal” in “extenuating circumstances”, a spokeman recalls only a single example, from the 1990s – when, in line with the 1992 Museums and Galleries Act, which permits objects to be transferred between national institutions, several drawings were handed over to the British Museum. Yet, according to former museum boss Charles Saumarez Smith, “there have been periods of deaccessioning” in the UK: “Actually, lots of things have been deaccessioned over the years.” And now, it seems, advocates for the practice may be gaining followers on these shores, too. Consider the Royal Academy of Arts, which, following the rejection of its application to the Government’s Culture Recovery Fund, has shed more than a quarter of its workforce. “Are we out of the woods?” asks its chief executive Axel Rüger, looking grim-faced over Zoom. “Not by a long shot.” The RA is known for temporary exhibitions, which, in ordinary times, provide around a fifth of its total revenue. But it also has a permanent collection, consisting mostly of so-called “diploma works”, donated by artists – and, exceptionally, a circular marble relief by Michelangelo, valued at more than £100 million, which happens to be the Italian’s only sculpture in Britain. Last autumn,   that the RA should sell it, to avoid laying off staff. But, Rüger tells me, deaccessioning the Taddei Tondo (as the relief is known) was, and remains, a red line. “Ultimately, my task is to ensure the survival of the Royal Academy,” he says. “And the Royal Academy is not just a building. It is also the collection that I have been entrusted with.” The trouble is, he explains, that “to make a real difference, you have to sell the crown jewels. Selling fourth-rate objects is not going to generate the kind of money we need right now. And you can only sell something once. When it’s gone, it’s gone.” In 1962, Rüger reminds me, “the Academy sold the ‘Burlington House Cartoon’ by Leonardo, which is now in the National Gallery.” The sale raised a lot of money. “But,” Rüger continues, “has that been the ultimate liberation of the Royal Academy? No, it hasn’t.” Museums shouldn’t consider their masterpieces as “financial assets”, he adds. Clearly, then, there is “good” deaccessioning and “bad”. Furthermore, all the back-and-forth is part of a bigger debate about what museums, fundamentally, are for. Should they always be striving to expand? Or is it valid simply to look after what they’ve already got? For decades, Rüger says, museums have enjoyed “almost unbridled growth”. But now, he explains, “for us, the principle is sustainability”. Ultimately, he sees himself as a “mere custodian” of the RA: “And, when you’re in our business, the purpose is to preserve it – to hand it back, hopefully, in slightly better shape than you found it, but, at least, unscathed and undamaged, for future generations.”",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/celebrity-interviews/david-baldacci-mothers-tough-upbringing-theremote-mountains/,culture,"It was the summer of 1976. I’d just turned 16 and was about to start my sophomore year when my dad Rudolph suggested one last road trip for the summer. My mum, Joyce, said she wanted to visit her old homestead in the remote  mountains on Ramsey’s Ridge that my grandfather had built. She hadn’t been back since just after I was born. All I knew was that mum had a hard life there. She was the youngest of 10 kids and many of them had already moved out. Because her parents had a difficult relationship, she and her favourite sister Sydney were often left alone in this isolated farmhouse from the ages of seven and eight. Apparently, when dad was courting mum, he would carry a pistol because of the bears and cougars. It was so remote, it wasn’t like you could call the police if you had a problem. I had visions of the unnerving movie Deliverance, with city folk encountering wild mountain men, fearing for their lives, and the tinkling of banjos. Despite that, I was looking forward to leaving the city. It had been a rough couple of months. My dad had been working for a trucking firm, which was bought by the mob from   who sold everything and eventually laid him off. It was a shock. Along with my older brother and sister, we were now a family of five living off my mum’s salary from a phone company. We all piled into dad’s 1974 Buick as long as a boat and drove for the “short” trip that was seven hours long. When we finally got to the mountain, it was all hairpin turns, no guard rails and steep drops like in the Italian Alps. My dad couldn’t handle the driving so my mum took over. She was fearless.  All of a sudden there was a commotion and we ground to a halt. I gingerly popped my head up. Coming steaming towards us on this single track was a huge backhoe [digger], driven at speed by a nutty guy with six kids swinging off it, like it was a playset. Mum rolled down the window to yell at him; he yelled back. As I peeked through the window, I asked “Mum, who is that?” She replied nonchalantly: “Oh, that’s your uncle Garcy.” She got out of the car and he jumped down off the hoe and they chatted, but there was no warmth. She later told me he was a coalminer who still lived on the mountain in a cinderblock trailer on a farm, with his wife and 21 children. Eventually, we got to the old farmhouse. Except for my uncle Garcy, all the family had moved to nearby states because unless you were a coalminer, there wasn’t a whole lot to do. Nobody had lived in the house since the early 1960s, so it had almost been reclaimed by the land. There was a tree in the front room, and debris everywhere, along with snakes and other undesirables. The fancy red and gold wallpaper had survived, along with the pot-bellied stove and stack to the ceiling.  Mum showed us the bedroom she shared with Sydney, the remnants of the kitchen and, as we walked around the vast property, the falling down barn with the basketball hoop made from an actual basket and the river that ran behind it. Down a half-mile path was the old family coal mine, which was for their personal cooking and heating. One of mum’s jobs when she was little was to take her bucket and collect coal every night. That image has always stayed with me. I was struck by how remote it was, the opposite of our neighbourhood in Richmond. Here, there was a stillness in the air, birdsong and the faint hum of farm machinery in the distance. Mum told us stories of Walter Bundy, their family doctor, arriving by mule if he needed to be called, especially for all of their home births. But over the years, mum learnt how to deal with any bumps, scraps and upsets stoically in their mountain way.  I could see why she’d had to be so self-reliant and independent. You couldn’t just pop down to the shops or service station. She could fix cars, shoot vermin, grow and cook vegetables from a young age. Near the end of her life, she told me how many times she came close to dying on that mountain and how she never wanted that to happen to her kids, which is why she was glad to escape to the city.  It was that trip, and my mum’s tales, that inspired my novel Wish You Well. The great-grandmother, Louisa Mae, and granddaughter, Lou, were based on my mum and grandmother, and I modelled George Davis after my uncle Garcy, who lived into his 80s despite his black lung from coal mining.  That trip changed my life; it gave me a greater appreciation of the hardships my mum had to go through and how she wanted things to be better for us. I certainly didn’t take things for granted any more afterwards.",1

WH Auden thought this tale of fantastic creatures looking for lost jewellery was a “masterpiece”.

A hilarious satire on bleak rural romances. “Something nasty” has been observed in the woodshed, and elderly Ada Doom is perturbed.

A plebian hero struggles against the materialism and hypocrisy of French society with his “force d’ame”. “One for all and all for one”: the eponymous swashbucklers battle the mysterious Milady in 17th-century France. Written to “germinate” social change, Germinal unflinchingly documents the starvation of French miners. A Frenchman kills an Arab friend in Algiers and accepts “the gentle indifference of the world” in an existentialist fable championed by fellow philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre. An illuminating historical whodunit set in a 14th-century Italian monastery. Eco, previously an obscure semantics professor, was baffled when his book became a bestseller. An Australian heiress bets an Anglican priest he can’t move a glass church 400 kilometres, in a shaggy-dog story that won Carey the first of his two Booker Prizes (he scooped the award again in 2001 with True History of the Kelly Gang). Rhys’s post-colonial prequel to Jane Eyre gives moving, human voice to the “madwoman in the attic” (Mr Rochester's first wife). The ludic logic of “Carroll” (the pen-name of mathematician Charles Dodgson) makes it possible to believe six impossible things before breakfast, as young Alice slips down the rabbit-hole into a world of talking animals.  US Air Force pilot Yossarian drives himself crazy trying get out of active service in the Second World War. But trying to get out of a war is clear-cut proof of sanity, surely? So he’s stuck. The title of Heller’s satirical epic is still shorthand for inescapable lose-lose loopholes. K proclaims he’s innocent when unexpectedly arrested. But “innocent of what”? We never find out, but this posthumously published nightmare made “Kafkaesque” the go-to label for any instance of hellish bureaucracy. The first part of a trilogy inspired by Lee’s Gloucester childhood; the protagonist’s first romantic encounter with the titular Rosie (that “first long secret drink of golden fire”) is under a hay wagon. A gentle comedy in which a Gandhi-inspired Indian youth becomes an anti-British extremist. The horror of the Great War as seen by a teenage German soldier. It became an Oscar-winning film in 1930, and was later banned – and burned – by Hitler’s regime. Three Baltimore siblings are differently affected by their parents’ unexplained separation. The best of Tyler’s many excellent books. A profound and panoramic insight into 18th-century Chinese society. In a historical page-turner, Garibaldi’s Redshirts sweep through Sicily, the “jackals” ousting the nobility, or “leopards”. International book fraud is exposed in this playful postmodernist puzzle. A former TV scientist preaches “a new sexuality, born from a perverse technology” – more specifically, getting your kicks from car-crashes. East African-Indian Salim travels to the heart of Africa and finds “the world is what it is”, in the Nobel-winner Naipaul’s most lauded work. Boy meets pawnbroker. Boy kills pawnbroker with an axe. Guilt, breakdown, Siberia, redemption. A romantic young doctor’s idealism is trampled by the atrocities of the Russian Revolution. This tale follows three generations of Cairenes from the First World War to the coup of 1952. Stevenson’s “bogey tale” of a scientist who tries (unsuccessfully) to banish his dark side came to him in a dream. A scribulous riff on travellers’ tall tales. The Brobdingnag giants and Lilliput midgets Gulliver meets may seem far-fetched, but Swift’s satirical targets were closer to home (the Lilliputian Court is really that of George I). A painter is murdered in Istanbul in 1591. Unusually, we hear from the corpse. Myth and reality melt magically together in this Colombian family saga. A failed novelist steals a woman’s trashed diaries, which reveal she’s plotting her own murder. A gang of South American poets travel the world, sleep around, challenge critics to duels. Who wouldn’t? Intellectuals withdraw from life to play a game of musical and mathematical rules in an ivory tower, in this futuristic coming-of-age parable.

In this paragraph-less novel, a Czech-born historian traces his own history back to the Holocaust. A scholar’s sexual obsession with a prepubescent “nymphet” is complicated by her mother’s passion for him. The narrator may be a loathsome paedophile, but his gift for language is irresistible. First published in Paris, Nabokov’s darkly comic novel caused a scandal; the Home Office ordered customs guards to seize any copy entering the UK. After nuclear war has rendered most of the United States sterile, fertile women are enslaved for breeding in a close-to-the-bone sci-fi tale. As Atwood has pointed out, every act of cruelty inflicted on women in this book has already happened somewhere in the world. Expelled from a “phony” prep school, an adolescent anti-hero goes through a difficult phase. From baseball to nuclear waste, all late-20th-century American life is here, in this non-linear epic narrated by a businessman in jail for murder. A brutal, haunting, jazz-inflected journey down the darkest narrative rivers of American slavery. In Virginia, controversy over its graphic content led to the so-called “Beloved bill” – a draft law giving parents the right to ban books from schools – though the bill was vetoed by the state’s governor in 2016. “Okies” set out from the Depression dust-bowl seeking decent wages and dignity, in this realist masterpiece. Baldwin’s semi-autobiographical novel explores the role of the Church in Harlem’s African-American community. Against the backdrop of the 1968 Prague Spring, a doctor’s infidelities distress his wife. But if life means nothing, Kundera muses, surely it can’t matter? A meddling teacher is betrayed by a favourite pupil who becomes a nun. Did the watch salesman kill the girl on the beach. If so, who heard? A historian becomes increasingly sickened by his existence, but decides to muddle on, in Sartre’s first novel – an existentialist touchstone. A former high-school basketball star is unsatisfied by marriage, fatherhood and sales jobs, in four comic novels (and a later novella). A boy and a runaway slave set sail on the Mississippi, away from Antebellum “sivilisation”. “Consulting detective” Sherlock Holmes chases a ghostly dog across the midnight moors. Lily Bart craves luxury too much to marry for love. Scandal and sleeping pills ensue, in what one critic called a savage attack on “an irresponsible, grasping and morally corrupt upper class”. A Nigerian yam farmer’s local leadership is shaken by accidental death and a missionary’s arrival. A mysterious millionaire’s love for a woman with “a voice full of money” gets him in trouble. “Of all novelists in any country, Trollope best understands the role of money,” said WH Auden. Here is the proof. An ex-convict (locked up for stealing a loaf of bread) struggles to become a force for good, but it ends badly. Better than  . An uncommitted history lecturer clashes with his pompous boss, becomes drunk and gets the girl. The roguish anti-hero was modelled on the poet Philip Larkin. “Dead men are heavier than broken hearts” in a hardboiled crime noir with a plot so convoluted even Chandler claimed not to understand it. One of the first English novels, an epistolary adventure whose heroine’s bodice is savagely unlaced by the brothel-keeping Robert Lovelace. A 12-book saga about upper-class life whose most celebrated character wears “the wrong kind of overcoat”. Published 60 years after their author was gassed, these two novellas portray city and village life in Nazi-occupied France. McEwan put the “c” word in the classic English country-house novel, following a lovelorn student from a stately home to prison to the Second World War. We follow the jigsaw puzzle of lives in a Parisian apartment block, in a playful postmodern classic; each chapter is set in a different room of the building. A thigh-thwacking yarn of a foundling boy sowing his wild oats before marrying the girl next door. Human endeavours “to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world” have tragic consequences, as a scientist assembles a new body from bits of corpses – and brings it to life. Shelley was still a teenager when she wrote it, after Lord Byron challenged her to come up with a ghost story. Northern villagers turn their bonnets against the social changes accompanying the industrial revolution. Hailed by TS Eliot as “the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels”, it retells the hunt for a missing jewel through a series of letters. A modernist masterpiece, reworking Homer with humour. Following a bored student and a middle-aged advertising salesman as they wander across Dublin, it contains one of the longest “sentences” in English literature: 4,391 words. Buying the lies of romance novels leads a provincial doctor’s wife to an agonising end.   has called it “the greatest novel” ever written. A false accusation exposes the racist oppression of British rule in India. It was inspired by Forster’s own time on the subcontinent, working as a secretary to a Maharajah. A totalitarian dystopia in which Big Brother is even more sinister than the TV series it inspired. Samuel Johnson thought Sterne’s bawdy, experimental novel was too odd to last. Pah! Centuries later, Tristram’s failed attempt to tell his life story – he keeps becoming distracted mid-sentence – still has readers cackling. Bloodsucking Martian invaders are wiped out by a dose of the sniffles. A radio adaptation by Orson Welles was so successful that American listeners really thought aliens were invading. (Or so the story goes.) Waugh based the hapless junior-reporter hero of this journalistic farce on former Telegraph editor Bill Deedes. Sexual double standards are held up to the cold, Wessex light in this rural tragedy, which carries the subtitle “A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented”. A seaside sociopath mucks up murder and marriage in Greene’s literary Punch and Judy show. Scrape-prone toff Bertie Wooster and his pals are suavely manipulated by his gentleman’s personal gentleman, Jeeves. Out on the winding, windy moors, Cathy and Heathcliff become each other’s “souls”. Then he storms off. Published under a pseudonym, it was Emily Brontë’s only novel; she died a year later. Debt and deception in Dickens’s semi-autobiographical Bildungsroman, crammed with cads, creeps and capital fellows. A slave trader is shipwrecked, but finds God – and a native to convert – on a desert island. Spiky Elizabeth can’t stand aloof Mr Darcy, nor is he keen on her. Sure enough, they’re soon in love! A picaresque tale about an elderly gent who has read too many romantic novels and decides to become a knight in shining armour. It has given us the word “quixotic”, for any over-idealistic boondoggle. While holding a party, our heroine hears about a stranger’s suicide – and finds it oddly inspirational – in a masterpiece of stream-of-consciousness.  An English professor in post-apartheid South Africa loses everything after seducing a student, in this Booker-winning political allegory. Poor and obscure and plain as Jane is, Mr Rochester wants to marry her. Illegally. (He’s already married – see Wide Sargasso Sea, above.) A seven-volume autobiographical meditation on memory, featuring literature’s most celebrated cake. “The conquest of the earth,” writes Conrad, “is not a pretty thing.” Steamboat captain Marlowe discovers this for himself, when he travels up the Congo for a rendezvous with a deranged ivory trader. Francis Ford Coppola shifted the plot to Sixties Vietnam for his film Apocalypse Now. An American heiress in Europe “affronts her destiny” by marrying an adulterous egoist. Nobody has the style of Henry James. Tolstoy’s idea for this tale of a doomed adulteress’s affair with a rich count grew from a daydream of “a bare exquisite aristocratic elbow”. William Faulkner thought it was the finest novel ever written – and so did the none-too-modest Tolstoy. Monomaniacal Captain Ahab seeks vengeance on the white whale that ate his leg, in a 900-page epic narrated by a sailor who calls himself Ishmael. The insights into human nature more than make up for the lengthy descriptions of harpooning. “One of the few English novels written for grown-up people,” said Virginia Woolf, praising this richly detailed portrait of overlapping lives in a fictional Midlands town.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/questorhts-covid-recovery-may-not-quick-has-net-cash-decent/,business,"Limited high street footfall, a reduced loan book and uncertainty over the unsecured lending operation all mean that analysts expect profits to drop in the coming year at H&T, and as a result the shares may not quickly recoup even the limited ground lost since  . But the firm is the market leader in its primary business of pawnbroking, the balance sheet is strong and the respectable dividend yield looks well covered, so patient investors can stick with the stock. January’s trading statement had already flagged a strong end to the 2020 calendar year, so last week’s full-year results contained few surprises. The pledge book shrank by a third and operating profits by a quarter as a result of temporary store closures, social distancing requirements when they reopened and subdued demand for new loans. In addition, H&T did its best to help customers in need by freezing interest payments during store closures and offering payment deferrals where appropriate. The payment of interim and final dividends in 2020, after the prudent decision to pass 2019’s final distribution, speaks of confidence in the future. Even if 2021 could be another testing year, H&T’s pawnbroking arm provides a valuable service to those who have difficulty getting credit elsewhere. An online payment portal is a useful new service for customers and the Surrey-based company also offers click-and-collect services at its jewellery retail business via a newly refreshed website. Higher levels of activity on the high street and increased demand for short-term loans could help the pledge book to grow steadily once more. Higher gold prices would be a further bonus, as would any resumption of international travel for the currency exchange operations. None of these may happen quickly, but the balance sheet has net cash even after lease liabilities are accounted for, while the forecast yield of 3.2pc also means shareholders can afford to wait for a potential profit uptick in 2022 and beyond. The forecast price-to-earnings ratio of almost 16 may not seem quite so appealing but that figure is the result of the subdued profit expected for the year. The firm made 43.8p in earnings per share in 2019 and the stock trades on just 6.7 times that figure. There is still clear recovery potential here.  A bid last week from Bally’s, an American casino and racetrack operator, means we may truly have  , the gaming services firm that once went by the name of JackpotJoy. Bally’s is offering £18.50 a share in cash or the option to accept all, or a portion, of the offer in its own, New York-listed stock. The proposed ratio is 0.343 of a Bally’s share to each Gamesys share. A price of $73.63 for Bally’s, after some smart gains in the wake of the announcement, and an exchange rate of $1.3762 mean this equates to £18.35 at the time of writing. Gamesys’s shares have shot past the offer price, even though there is no guarantee that the proposed deal will be consummated. This implies that the market thinks a counter-bid may be in the offing, or at least that Bally’s may have to go higher to net its prize amid the frenzy that surrounds the gaming market as America deregulates and US firms seek technological expertise so they can capitalise. The shares stood at 800p when this column  , so cautious investors may choose to sell a few shares now above the offer price – perhaps enough to cover their initial investment – and lock in their gains. Others may elect to spin the wheel and wait to see what happens next. The only bad news is that our decision earlier this month to   now looks distinctly premature. Having already doubled, 888’s shares have romped higher by some 50pc in the past week to offer further proof, as if it were needed, that financial markets will always keep you humble. It could be worth holding on to Gamesys, however.",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/shares/questor-vaccine-makers-shares-suffer-big-declines-discover/,business,"“Buy on weakness,” we suggested last month  , the vaccine maker. Well, there has been plenty of weakness: the shares stand 25pc below where they were when that column appeared. It is not the only vaccine maker to suffer a severe fall in its share price over the past few weeks.  , whose technology lies behind the Pfizer vaccine, has suffered a 20pc fall since mid-February and Moderna’s shares are 28pc lower over the same period. What is going on? Almost everyone on earth wants to get their hands on these companies’ products and  , so why does no one want their shares all of a sudden? In Questor’s view, the share price falls have nothing to do with vaccines or these companies and everything to do with shifts in the stock market – shifts, ironically, prompted by the success of those very vaccines. Investors are clearly lumping the vaccine makers in with technology stocks, or indeed growth stocks more generally, and have conceived an aversion to both on the basis that economic conditions will start to favour “value” stocks instead. The thinking goes like this. The vaccination programme will in time, despite the slowness of the rollout in many countries, lead to the end of lockdowns and therefore  . In such circumstances the businesses that experience the greatest improvement are those that suffered the most during the pandemic, such as those in the travel and leisure sectors. Investors therefore want to put their money into these stocks and they raise that money by selling their growth or tech holdings, which they see as having had their time in the sun. When economies are static or shrinking, investors are prepared to pay a higher price for the few companies able to grow – tech firms being the most obvious – but they are less inclined to pay up when far more humdrum, and more cheaply valued, businesses are growing as the rising tide floats all boats. A more technical matter accentuates the trend: investors sense the   and as a result no longer want to own conventional (non-index-linked) bonds. This pushes up their yields and this increases the “discount rate” that investors apply to investment returns they can expect into the future. The effect is to reduce the present value of those future returns and hence the value of the stocks that will produce them. Those already expensive growth stocks are the ones to feel the effects. In short, the falls in the vaccine makers’ shares say nothing at all about the quality of these businesses. They remain at the heart of countries’ efforts to extricate themselves from Covid’s grip and can expect to remain there in view of the growing realisation of the dangers posed by mutations of the virus. We may not relish the need for booster shots every few months but it will do no harm to the prospects of these businesses – and it is the makers of “mRNA-based” vaccines in particular that may be expected to bear much of the load as they are the ones, experts say, that are most easily and quickly adapted to counter new coronavirus strains. The pandemic has provided the validation that mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics needed and these firms have bright prospects well into the future. What then of our tips? As we said, we advised readers in the case of CureVac to buy on weakness and suggest that they do precisely that now. We are very happy to hold BioNTech. We had already taken (very large) profits on Moderna and see little need for readers to hold three firms in the same sector, although some may sense a bargain with the shares at their current price. The only vaccine maker we have tipped not to suffer a severe sell-off is Astra, no doubt because it had never benefited from its vaccine in the first place. Astra, famously and yet with little appreciation from some quarters,  . And the mud that is routinely thrown at it, justified or not, hardly helps the market’s perception of the firm. We   for its intelligent approach to researching new treatments, the opportunities presented by its presence in China and its highly capable boss. We did however say buy on weakness in Astra’s case too so readers should continue to watch the share price for such an opportunity.",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/oscars-2021-date-time-uk-watch-live/,culture,"This year’s rather unusual film awards season culminates with Oscars in late April. But what can we expect from the 2021 Academy Awards - and how much will Covid change Hollywood’s big night?  The ceremony for the   takes place on April 25, airing live on US TV station ABC at 8pm Eastern Daylight Time (midnight UK time). It’s a delay from its usual February date. Sky Cinema will air the event in full on its sub-channel Sky Cinema Oscars, followed by a highlights reel on Sky One. The Sky coverage will also be streamed online through Now TV. Existing Sky TV customers can sign up Sky Cinema for £11 a month, or you can pay £11.99 a month for Now TV’s Sky Cinema Pass. Although there’s a handy loophole for the latter: you can get a seven-day free trial. The ceremony will be held outdoors in a courtyard at downtown railway hub Union Station in Los Angeles. According to veteran Oscars director Glenn Weiss and first-time producers Jesse Collins, Stacey Sher and   (an apt choice: the director of  ), there will also be some “additional show elements” coming live from the Dolby Theatre – which usually hosts the Oscars ceremony. In a joint statement, the producers stressed that they want the telecast to “look like a movie, not a television show.” So, expect some ambitious elements – perhaps musical performances or comic skits from the Dolby. The Oscars haven’t had a host for the past two years; the last host was  . It looks like there will not be a host in 2021 either, but instead a reliance on multiple awards presenters to keep the show on the road. In the main: yes. The producers are urging nominees to show up at what they call “an intimate, in-person event” - and no Zoom participation is limited (avoiding the disasters of the  ). However, the Academy has made a concession for international nominees because of Covid travel concerns. For the Brits, there will a London broadcast hub. Only nominees, their guests and the presenters will be invited to this scaled-down Oscars. Organisers are also enlisting celebrities for video interviews to be taped ahead of time and broadcast during the show. We don’t yet know who the presenters are, although we’ll likely see the usual mix of A-list actors and directors, including winners from last year - like Joaquin Phoenix, Renée Zellwegger, Brad Pitt and Laura Dern.  The producers have said that they are treating the event like an active movie set. That means an on-site Covid safety team administering PCR tests, and lots of rules in place for those attending - presumably involving mask wearing and social distancing.  Fear not: the tearful, rambling, occasionally political and always OTT acceptance speeches are a go. However, the producers have urged winners to “read the room” and “tell a story”, rather than just listing off names, and to bear in mind that organisers are “aiming for a feeling of casual exchange and good humour.” Absolutely. While some awards shows have embraced lockdown fashion (i.e. pyjamas as daywear), the Academy Awards are holding firm. The dress code, per the producers, is “a fusion of Inspirational and Aspirational, which in actual words means formal is totally cool if you want to go there, but casual is really not.” In other words, ditch the hoodie and dust off that tux. Not as such. But there will be a 60-minute, pre-show virtual event from   (who won the Best Original Song Oscar last year for  ), raising money for his AIDS Foundation. Neil Patrick Harris will host, alongside John and David Furnish, with a stripped-back performance from Dua Lipa. The special will be on virtual platform Cisco Webex, streamed in the US on April 25 and elsewhere (including the UK) on April 26. You can purchase tickets via Ticketmaster. Vanity Fair is also going online with a charity event series to benefit the Motion Picture & Television Fund’s Covid relief efforts. Their Cocktail Hour Live will take place April 13-15, offering a mix of interviews, performances, panel discussions and cast reunions. A-listers confirmed include Serena Williams, Michael B Jordan, Gal Gadot, Glenn Close, and   nominee Amanda Seyfried. The awards honour films released between January 1 2000 and February 28 2021. The Academy’s board of governors voted to temporarily allow films that were first released via streaming services or video on demand to be eligible, if they were originally scheduled to have a theatrical release. That means films which haven’t yet been released in cinemas, due to Covid, are still considered. This year’s list of nominees has already made history. There are two women in the Best Director category:   for   and Emerald Fennell for  , with Zhao hotly tipped to win the award - as is Nomadland for Best Picture. There are also nine actors of colour nominated, including the first Asian-American up for Best Actor,  ’s Steven Yeun. We may well see a diverse list of winners, too, with the late   favourite to win a posthumous Best Actor Award for  , and Daniel Kaluuya leading the race for Best Supporting Actor for . Adding to a good haul for the Brits, we may well see Ferrell nab a Best Original Screenplay trophy and/or Sacha Baron Cohen take Best Adapted Screenplay for  , following their Writers Guild Awards wins. Also in the mix are David Fincher’s Mank, which picked up an impressive 10 Oscar nominations; The Father, starring Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, with six nods; Aaron Sorkin’s  , with six; the Riz Ahmed-starring Sound of Metal, also with six; and Best Actress challenges from Andra Day in  , and Vanessa Kirby in  . And might the silly spoof   scoop Best Original Song? Stranger things have happened...

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/green-homes-grant-axed-six-months-following-poor-take-up/,business,"Rishi Sunak’s £2bn   is to shut after just six months following low take-up by the public. The insulation subsidy programme   is closing on Wednesday amid a failure to win widespread support. It was previously touted as a key part of government efforts to “build back greener” and meet the country’s climate goals, but was dogged by delays as would-be applicants struggled to get quotes for work from busy builders. Last week, a report by MPs accused ministers of underestimating the cost of improving the efficiency of many homes and asked for the scheme to be extended to accommodate the delays. The environmental audit select committee said the scheme was essential for improving Britain’s energy efficiency plans, but warned that delays in grant payments “had devastating consequences on many of the builders and installers that can do the work, who have been left in limbo as a result of the orders cancelled”. Before the decision to close the scheme was made, it was due to run until March 2022. The programme allowed English homeowners to apply for vouchers worth up to £10,000 to make their properties more efficient, cutting emissions and promising a saving on bills of up to £600 a year. The money could cover up to two thirds of the cost of improvements such as loft or cavity wall insulation and draught proofing. Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, said an extra £300m will be made available for investing in energy-saving measures for homes instead, distributed by local authorities. A spokesman for the Business Department said: “Applications made before the end of March deadline will be honoured and any vouchers already issued may be extended upon request.”",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/comedys-finest-crack-up-reginald-perrin-made-middle-class-monotony/,culture,"“Mother rang – she wants to know if we’re going to see her on Sunday.” Cue the image of a hippopotamus trotting through the mud. The best-remembered gag from The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin is – almost 45 years since it first aired – still very funny. Sure, that hippo trots right into the category of standard Seventies mother-in-law material, but there’s really nothing standard about The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, which is now being repeated on BBC Four after being absent from our screens for decades.  Though set in the leafy south London suburb of ‘Climthorpe’, it’s not a cosy living room comedy; nor a sitcom in which the characters’ weekly schemes revert, as most sitcoms do, to a familiar status quo before the following week’s episode. Rather, Reggie Perrin – played with manic, melancholic brilliance by – lives a middling life: middle-aged, middle-class, middle-management. And en route to a breakdown – via the daily commute to his job at Sunshine Desserts. According to open titles, Reggie has “begun to behave very oddly!” The stress, boredom, and inevitable crack-up cause Perrin to fake his own death. It’s a surreal, satirical journey that edges towards occasional man-on-the-brink darkness. But between meltdowns Reggie would call himself an “ordinary bloke”. As he tells his wife Elizabeth – the delectably charming Pauline Yates – at the beginning of the third series: “I’m no different from anyone else who walked out on a job, faked suicide, started a new life, returned in disguise, remarried his wife, opened a shop selling goods guaranteed absolutely useless, to his amazement succeeded, walked out again, faked another suicide, and started another new life.” The series was written by  and adapted from his own series of novels, the first of which was The Death of Reginald Perrin – published in 1975. Nobbs, who died in 2015, got his start in comedy by writing sketches for That Was the Week That Was. He also wrote for heavyweight names that included Les Dawson, Frankie Howerd, Ken Dodd, Tommy Cooper, Dick Emery, and the Two Ronnies. Nobbs created Reggie Perrin after the BBC asked him to submit an idea for a half hour play about social problems, as part of a series. His pitch – about a man driven mad by his commute – was rejected. But Nobbs turned the idea into a novel. The original draft had a slightly different twist – the early incarnation of Perrin ended up in a psychiatric home rather than faking his own death. In his autobiography, Nobbs recalled some inspirations, including an article he’d read about the tedious process that a jam manufacturer went through to create a new flavour; and a mortgage company advert with a nauseatingly smug family in matching outfits. “In my mind this was a key image for the world against which Reggie was rebelling,” wrote Nobbs. Also, as a child, Nobbs would get the train to school, surrounded each morning by the type of commuters that Reginald Perrin was doomed to become – pinstriped suits, umbrellas, newspapers. Nobbs wanted   for the role of Perrin, and Barker was certainly a fan. “I laughed two hundred and eighty-seven times and cried twice,” said Barker about reading Nobbs’s book. “I would love to play Reggie Perrin in a film. I still feel I am Reggie Perrin as I walk about. What a beautiful book.” Granada offered to make it as a two-part drama with Barker, but Nobbs’s agent insisted it should be a sitcom at the BBC. “I couldn’t believe my ears,” said Nobbs. “My novel a sit-com!” When Nobbs went for a meeting with Jimmy Gilbert, the Head of Comedy at the BBC, Gilbert asked if he had anyone in mind for the role of Reggie Perrin. “Yes, Ronnie Barker,” said Nobbs. Gilbert replied: “Very good. Leonard Rossiter it is.” Rossiter had become a star from his performance as Rigsby, the lecherous, misery-guts landlord in the hit ITV sitcom Rising Damp. Nobbs admitted that he was disappointed at first but soon changed his mind. “Suddenly I felt that he might be irresistible in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin,” Nobbs wrote about Rossiter. The first series began broadcasting on September 8, 1976. Watched now, it’s still joyously unusual – not to mention strangely relatable, as Reggie tries to escape the monotonous, middle class existence which closes in on him. Each morning he kisses his wife at the door; each morning he walks the same streets of the “Poets Estate” – through Coleridge Close, Tennyson Avenue, and Wordsworth Drive; and each day suffers the banality of a so-called-life inside Sunshine Desserts. The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin perfectly captures 1970s Britain, with its drab interiors, processed puddings, and manufacturing decline – even the Sunshine Desserts sign is crumbling from above the door, one letter at a time. Perrin is plagued by visions: not just his mother-in-law as a hippo, but him flashing at a neighbour on his way to work, torturing his boss on a rack, and rapturous trysts with his secretary Joan (Corrie’s Sue Nicholls). The fractured state of Reggie’s mind shows with his increasingly outlandish excuses for being late into the office every day: “Eleven minutes late, somebody had stolen the lines at Surbiton… Seventeen minutes late, water seeping through the cables at Effingham Junction – there was a lot of Effingham and a good deal of Blindingham… Twenty-two minutes late, escaped puma, Chessington North.” Indeed, seen from Reggie’s perspective, the real world is slightly skew whiff: there's a fellow commuter who blows his nose on various newspaper supplements; his brother-in-law Jimmy (the deadpan Geoffrey Palmer), forever dropping by to blag the contents of their fridge – “Bit of a cock-up on the catering front”; and a family trip to a safari park so infuriating that Reggie gets out of the car while in the lion park. (Nobbs recalled that while shooting the scenes at Longleat, a coachload of Welsh pensioners came into the area and excitedly photographed the lions – but the lions quickly revealed themselves to be BBC props men in costumes.) There’s humanity in Leonard Rossiter’s finely-tuned performance – a bundle of repression and desperation. According to Nobbs, Rossiter was a “perfectionist and not always easy to work with”. In the best episode, Reggie plans to have an affair with his secretary Joan while his wife’s away. It goes wrong when all of the family decide to pop round at the same time, forcing Reggie to keep his fancy woman hidden in the bedroom while he distracts everyone else, trying to keep them from going upstairs. In those scenes he’s possessed by a wild-eyed mania, stumbling over his words with rapid-fire, precision-perfect delivery. “Leonard could express the anxieties Reggie was experiencing in every move, expression and word he uttered,” said Nobbs. ""He could also combine pace with subtlety, which is very difficult. Most actors who try being subtle come across as slow, but not Leonard – he could rattle the lines out at a rate of knots while still retaining that degree of delicacy."" You do have to admire Reggie’s gumption to reject modern life. There’s a sense of wish-fulfillment as he plunges into crack-pottery. In one sequence he dreams of pelting muck at his boss, the pompous C.J. (John Barron); in the real world, he can’t suppress what he really thinks any longer. “I can’t be bothered with this,” he says during a sales meeting. “Life’s too short.”  Eventually, Perrin fakes his own death by leaving his clothes on a beach in Dorset and heading into the sea. He then switches between various identities, with daft wigs and buck teeth. But he misses his family and returns home in the guise of bearded alter-ego Martin Wellbourne, and remarries Elizabeth. As Martin he even attends his own memorial service – a deceptively dark, psychologically troubling scenario. The show is not entirely free of old school sitcom fare. There’s rude humour, of course – the kind that seemed to make Seventies studio audiences howl saucily, such as a recurring joke about chairs that make a whoopee cushion noise whenever sat on. That gag actually came from Nobbs’s first visit to Jimmy Gilbert’s office. His chair sounded “like a cross between a muffled fart and an elderly toad’s sigh of satisfaction,” said Nobbs. There are plenty of catchphrases. too The likes of “Great!” and “Super!” soon get old – the respective catchphrases of junior yes men Tony and David (Trevor Adams and Bruce Bould) – but C.J.’s patented “I didn’t get to where I am today…” is funny every time, and delightfully nonsensical. (See: “I didn't get where I am today without knowing a real winner when I see one”; “I didn't get where I am today by indulging in hanky panky”; and “I didn't get where I am today by having green frogs thrust down my crotch”.) Nobbs knew the show was a hit when he heard some businessmen bantering in a hotel lobby. “I’m going up the stairs,” he heard one of them say. “I didn’t get where I am today by waiting for lifts.” “Great,” another man replied. “Super,” said the other. In 1977, Nobbs published a follow-up novel, The Return of Reginald Perrin. He had to – Leonard Rossiter would agree to a second series only if Nobbs wrote a second book too. He believed that’s where the depth of the show came from. In the second series, Perrin returns to his real identity – his wife Elizabeth seems surprisingly fine with the whole charade – and tries to have one more laugh at society’s expense by opening a shop called Grot, which proudly sells useless, overpriced rubbish. But the business is a huge success, which sees Reggie trapped in the rat race once again and trying – but failing – to sabotage his own business empire. He contemplates faking his death once again, but this time with Elizabeth. A third series followed in 1978 – based on book No. 3, The Better World of Reginald Perrin – in which Reggie and Elizabeth try to set up a utopia-like community for middle-class middle-aged people. It’s the weakest series – not particularly good, in fact. An episode in which Reggie and his gang try to scare the neighbours by wearing blackface will give BBC Four some pause for thought. A fourth series was made in 1996, but this time without Rossiter, who died in 1984. In The Legacy of Reginald Perrin, his friends and family each inherited £1 million, on the condition they “do something totally and utterly absurd”. Martin Clunes also played the character in a 2009 revival. The first series stands up as Reggie Perrin's finest few hours. It's even profound – a cynical assessment of an ordinary life. No matter what he does, he’s never happy. As Reginald Perrin says himself: “Sheer bliss isn’t enough!”",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/dick-van-dyke-true-marvel-wandavision/,culture,"“If someone from the UK sees me, they are on me like a pack of wolves,” joked  , who always accepted the mockery over his role in Mary Poppins with good grace, admitting he’d delivered “the most atrocious Cockney accent in the history of cinema”. Even so, the man who played Bert the chimney sweep remains indubitably popular. Paul Bettany, the London-born actor who plays Vision in  , said he drew on the American, one of his “favourite stars”, for inspiration in the hit Disney+ series. “I throw a little bit of Dick Van Dyke in there,” Bettany said of his accent playing the synthetic humanoid. WandaVision, the show based on Marvel Comics characters, has introduced a modern generation to the delights of the 95-year-old actor and singer, whose brilliant sitcom The Dick Van Dyke Show, which ran from 1961 to 1966, was a jewel of comedy writing and acting. The show, along with his contributions to popular films such as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Mary Poppins, forged Van Dyke’s reputation as an entertainment giant and one of the most likable stars ever to appear on television. Despite admitting that they had to explain WandaVision to Van Dyke, a man who “did not seem to be too fluent with the Marvel Cinematic Universe,” the show’s director Matt Shakman described his lunch with the veteran star as “one of the best afternoons of my life”. Shakman and Marvel President Kevin Feige picked his brains about his celebrated CBS series, and in turn appointed him as a consultant on WandaVision. “It was an opportunity to talk about how they made The Dick Van Dyke Show, which is one of the greatest television shows ever made. And it still works just as well today as it did back then. It’s a timeless classic,” Shakman told Looper. In the penultimate episode of the debut season of WandaVision, it is revealed that Wanda Maximoff’s Sokovian family were hooked on American sitcoms. We see her watching a clip from her favourite The Dick Van Dyke Show episode, one from 1963 called It May Look Like a Walnut. It had a science-fiction based plotline about body-snatching, tipping a nod to The Twilight Zone. The Dick Van Dyke Show’s creator Carl Reiner had to battle for that unusual episode to be made. “My partners didn’t want to do it,” he recalled. Van Dyke’s character Rob Petrie dreams that he may be the last remaining human, in a world ruled by an alien from the planet Twilo. “I wanted to use pods like they did in Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” Reiner added. “When I couldn’t, I decided to use walnuts. When Rob’s wife Laura [played by  ] comes sliding out of the hall closet on two thousand walnuts, that was worth the price of admission. We later gave those walnuts to charity.” The Dick Van Dyke show won 15 Emmys – three for its star and five for Reiner, who described Van Dyke as “maybe the most talented man I’d ever seen”. Audiences simply fell in love with Van Dyke’s character, the head writer on the fictional Alan Brady Show. Reiner played the egocentric, toupee-wearing Brady. “I had the most fun,” said Van Dyke, describing his time on the show as “the best five years of my life”. Part of this was down to his wonderful comic chemistry with Tyler Moore, and part was because of the quality of the dialogue by Reiner and his team of scriptwriters. When Van Dyke’s first wife Margie visited the set of the sitcom, she told him it didn’t look like he was acting at all. “You’re exactly like you are at home,” she said. Loose-limbed Van Dyke’s gift for slapstick stunts remains impressive. “Here’s a guy who is a physical comedian. ‘How do you make room for that and make it feel justified?’ we asked Dick,” revealed Shakman. “We learned so much from it. He told us about the general rule of thumb, which is, ‘if it can happen in real life, it can happen on the show,’ and I believe in that. Drawing on that experience makes room for as many falls over ottomans as you want.” Shakman was referring to the opening credits, in which Van Dyke falls over an ottoman footstool as he enters his living room, one of the most famous tumbles in television history. Van Dyke, who was born in West Plains, Missouri, on 13 December 1925, was “a Laurel and Hardy nut” when he was growing up, idolising the physical comedy of Laurel. During the making of The Dick Van Dyke Show, he came across Laurel’s listing in the local Californian telephone book and gave him a call out of the blue. He told the English-born comedian that he had imitated his pratfalls from an early age and “stolen from you pretty liberally”. “Yes, I know,” replied Laurel cheerily. The two men became friends, and Van Dyke later delivered a eulogy at Laurel’s funeral. There was plenty of bittersweet comedy in Van Dyke’s own family history. His father Loren was a former minor-league baseball player who ended up eking out a living as a travelling salesman for the Sunshine Cookie Company. He was then always known to friends and family as ‘Cookie’. It seems that Cookie crumbled after he fathered Van Dyke out of wedlock, with a stenographer called Hazel McCord. “Suddenly, the good life, as he knew it, vanished and he got a job as a salesman,” Van Dyke recalled in 2016 of his upbringing in Danville, Illinois. “He hated the work, but always had a shine on his shoes and a smile on his face. Years later, when I saw Death of a Salesman, I was depressed for a month. It was Dad’s story.” Although Van Dyke and his brother Jerry sometimes saw flashes of the witty bon vivant that their relatives remembered from better days, they always recognised the sad, quiet clown beneath the mask. Van Dyke remembered his mother as being far more talkative. “If she had a deficiency, it was absent-mindedness. She once cooked a ham and later found it in my father’s shirt drawer,” he added. Van Dyke, who was certified with a “highly gifted” IQ of 150, began to think of a career in showbusiness after making his mark as a radio announcer – first in high school and later after enlisting with the US Air Force – and was keenly aware of the power of publicity. He was “too broke” to marry his high-school sweetheart Margie Willett, but when a radio station agreed to pay for a honeymoon if they wed live on air, he readily agreed. “So, in 1948, we exchanged our vows in front of a minister and two radio microphones while 15 million people listened,” he explained. After working as a radio DJ, he pursued a career on Broadway. Television producer Sheldon Leonard spotted his potential after seeing him in a production of Bye Bye Birdie, suggesting to Reiner that he cast him in the television show that made him famous. His success brought Hollywood offers. After reprising his stage role of Albert Peterson in a film version of Bye Bye Birdie, he was offered the role of Bert (and the ageing Mr Dawes) in Mary Poppins, one of the most popular musicals of all time. Van Dyke starred opposite the eponymous nanny Julie Andrews. He said he was completely unaware during the shoot that anything was wrong with his Cockney accent, taught to him by a dialogue coach from Ireland. “I was working with an entire English cast and nobody said a word, not Julie Andrews, not anybody said I needed to work on it, so I thought I was alright,” he lamented in 2014. Even so, he was convinced that “something magical was going on,” in Mary Poppins, especially with the songs. Van Dyke grew up steeped in music – his father had played saxophone in a jazz band – and was a keen pianist. He went on to record several of his own albums, including one with the Ray Charles Singers. Van Dyke said he understood why cinema-goers connected with the lyrics, especially the “ridiculous word” supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. He said the catchy tunes Chim Chim Cher-ee, Let’s Go Fly a Kite, A Spoonful of Sugar and Feed the Birds, “didn’t just get under my skin, they became part of me then and never left”. Van Dyke had a well-earned reputation in Hollywood as a perfectionist. During the 1967 film Divorce American Style, he spent three days choreographing a single sequence, in order to perfect the timing of a scene in which he and his screen wife Debbie Reynolds open and slam closet doors, cabinet doors and bathroom doors after a bitter row. The following year, he starred in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. In his 2011 autobiography My Lucky Life in and Out of Show Business, he reveals that it was a role he “repeatedly turned down”. The casting was random. “Dick Van Dyke was older than me and I was playing his dad,” Lionel Jeffries, who starred as Grandpa Potts, remarked. After a big-money offer secured his participation, Van Dyke quickly regretted his involvement. He fell out with director Ken Hughes, who admitted he was “unenthusiastic” about a film based on Ian Fleming’s children’s book, using  s screenplay. Van Dyke overheard Hughes make a disparaging remark about the size of his nose (“what are we going to do about his hooter?”) and he later upbraided Hughes about his habit of swearing in front of the child actors. “Quite simply, I thought he was wrong for the picture,” wrote Van Dyke. “One day I heard him grouse that he had to rewrite Roald Dahl’s script. Who rewrote Roald Dahl?” Despite all the problems, Van Dyke excelled as Caractacus Pott, the eccentric inventor who creates a magical car. The musical numbers were memorable, including the title song, Hushabye Mountain and Truly Scrumptious. Van Dyke, who had always been a keen dancer, had his work cut out on the ensemble version of Me Ol’ Bamboo, a Morris dancing-based tune devised around composer Richard Sherman’s memories of England, when he used a bamboo walking stick. Van Dyke lost 15 pounds rehearsing that gruelling song over and over. “The bamboo sticks had metal poles inside and we had to jump over them and dance with them,” Van Dyke, who was 41 at the time, said in a TV documentary about the making of the film. “Most of the dancers were 15 years younger than me and it took us 23 takes to get it right. In the last take, I only just make it. This was the hardest dance number I ever did.” Van Dyke remained cheerfully candid about the film’s idiosyncrasies, including the fact that the English rain meant that many of the scenes were filmed in France. “We ran out of sunshine so filmed in the south of France, it’s all vineyards, you can see lots of grapes,” he said with a laugh. He didn’t enjoy driving the famous car, either, which he described as “very hard to handle and almost impossible to turn”. Although film offers continued to pour in, it became increasingly clear to Van Dyke that he had a serious drinking problem, something he had “deluded” himself into thinking he could handle, even after recognising that the drunken scenes he played in Divorce American Style were uncomfortably close to home. He likened his alcoholism to heroin addiction. “I tried to be a good role model to my children, but I was an alcoholic for 25 years, which inevitably impacted on family life,” he said. Margie, who suffered a miscarriage of twins before they had four children, was also struggling with her own problems. “When I pledged to quit and entered a rehab clinic, Margie checked in as I checked out. I thought she’d come to pick me up, but it turned out she was hooked on anti-depressants. I had no idea. What a pair,” he admitted in 2016. Van Dyke acknowledged that his drinking brought “personality changes” and mood swings. “I was in deep trouble, you get suicidal and think you just can’t go on. I had suicidal feelings, it was just terrible. But then suddenly, like a blessing, the drink started not to taste good,” he told The Telegraph that same year. By then, the actor was with his third wife, makeup artist Arlene Silver. After divorcing Margie in 1984, he spent the next 35 years with former actress Michelle Triola (Lee Marvin’s former girlfriend and a plaintiff against him in a famous palimony suit) who died in 2009 from lung cancer. He married Arlene in 2012, and both have talked in gushing terms about their happiness. Van Dyke dubbed their relationship “a second childhood”, while Silver, who is 46 years younger than her husband, called it “a fairytale”. When asked in 2014 what kept him youthful, Van Dyke quipped: “My young wife… she puts me in the fridge.” It is striking just how enthusiastic and joyful Van Dyke has remained, despite the ups and downs of life. In one reflective moment, in a 2011 interview with USA Today, he talked about his sanguine world view. “The only philosophy I have is that there is no such thing as security – not financial, not emotional, not anything. Insecurity is what exists and I think people make the mistake of trying to build security for themselves. If you can just live with that wisdom, of knowing there isn’t any security, that is a way of relaxing and sitting loosely in the saddle of life that’s much better, because you don’t worry,” he said. Although he was honest enough to admit he “gladly said ‘Yes’ to a hodgepodge of TV movies”, Van Dyke will be remembered for a rich legacy of work beyond his hit show and the two movie triumphs. Although certain projects never came to fruition – he wanted to play Stan Laurel in a biopic and King Lear on stage, and made the “stupid” decision to turn down the lead role in The Omen – he earned a Golden Globe nomination for The New Dick Van Dyke Show, a series written and directed by Reiner that ran from 1971 to 1974, about a Phoenix television talk show host. He went on to win a Golden Globe for ‘Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series’ for a 1989 episode of The Golden Girls. His successful role as a doctor in Diagnosis Murder, which aired from 1993 to 2001, also enabled him to wrangle work for his family. His brother Jerry – who joked that “I’ve been hanging on his coat-tails for 80 years” – son Barry and grandson Shane all appeared in that long-running medical crime drama, prompting Van Dyke to quip that “I took nepotism to its final point.” In his final senior citizen career days, Van Dyke moved into more villainous territory, playing a corrupt policeman in Warren Beatty’s Dick Tracy and a scheming security guard in Ben Stiller’s Night at the Museum. Nonagenarian, Van Dyke continued to keep fit – working out at the gym most days and swimming regularly – and penning, at 90, the book Keep Moving: And Other Tips and Truths About Aging. The actor railed against the way that “ageism has become the last acceptable form of discrimination.” In one poignant interview he reflected on the fact that he had lived so long that “my whole generation has disappeared on me,” reflecting on lost friends such as Paul Newman, Jack Lemmon and his Malibu neighbour and friend Charles Bronson, who always gave Van Dyke a lemon cake for Christmas. Van Dyke took heart in the way he remained revered as a pioneer by modern comedians. When Van Dyke conducted a Q&A at the 2017 Salt Lake Comic Con, Rob Schneider spoke to him from the audience, saying: “You planted the seeds and we have all been stealing from you for 55 years or so.” Schneider, a star of Saturday Night Live, also brought up the old chestnut joke by asking whether it was true that Dick Van Dyke had changed his name from Penis Van Lesbian? “I’ve had to live with that joke for so many years,” replied the 91-year-old amiably. He also showed his lighter side after being awarded the Britannia Award for Excellence in Television at the 2017 BAFTA awards. “They asked whom I would like to present the award, so I sent them a list of a whole load of dead people, including Laurence Olivier,” he joked. Van Dyke, humble and broad-minded, is a man of surprises. His hobbies include creating his own computer animations and singing in a Barbershop Quartet (his group, the Vantastix, once sang ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ before an LA Lakers basketball game). He is active on Instagram and Twitter and made public his dislike of Donald Trump (“there’s something missing”). He’s also a man with a social conscience, even in his 90s volunteering at the Los Angeles homeless charity The Midnight Mission. “I go down Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter, and I dance, I sing, I greet people at the door,” he said. Happily, his dancing feet still work, something evident in his cameo role in 2018’s Mary Poppins Returns, in which he played Mr. Dawes Jr. Production designer John Myre said he was concerned because the elderly actor’s dance scene “called for a big leap on to the desk of Colin Firth’s character, followed by a tap-dance break”. Dick Van Dyke told Myre to remove the safety steps that had been constructed. Myre said he executed his moves “flawlessly”. Dick Van Dyke fans had been hoping that there was one last television hurrah, with a guest appearance on the finale of WandaVision. Shakman was coy in January when asked about a possible cameo (“I couldn't possibly say,” he remarked), but speculation intensified when Bettany remarked that “there’s a huge reveal with an actor that I’ve always wanted to work with, and I have some real explosive scenes with him.” Van Dyke sadly didn't appear in the WandaVision finale. But that won't dampen the spirits of one of entertainment’s most upbeat performers. “I’ve had such a life and so much fun,” Van Dyke said recently. “I don’t regret a minute of it. I’ve just had the best time you can imagine.”",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/wonder-woman-wasnt-inside-george-millers-unmade-justice-league/,culture,"In an alternate dimension, Armie Hammer’s role in Call Me by Your Name would have been a risky departure for an actor best known for playing Batman. Mad Max: Fury Road may never have happened. And Megan Gale would have been a name on everybody’s lips. These were elements of Justice League: Mortal, an early incarnation of the Justice League movie that spectacularly flamed out in 2017 after being botched by Joss Whedon, and has now  . But before both version, Justice League: Mortal was due for a 2009 release under the directorial eye of Mad Max: Fury Road mastermind George Miller. Hollywood projects falling apart over time are nothing new, but Miller’s Justice League very nearly happened. By the time the film had been axed by Warner Bros over issues with its budget, its stars and its script, an array of actors had been cast, costumes had been designed and production was about to begin. It remains one of Hollywood’s most infamous unmade films. Information about the proposed movie has been leaked in anecdotes and concept art here and there over the years, forming a remarkable picture of a slightly muddled - if undeniably intriguing - comic book movie that never came to be. The film’s script, leaked online in 2013 and credited to married writing duo Michele and Kieran Mulroney, depicted Batman as an untrustworthy and vaguely dictatorial crime fighter who creates a surveillance machine known as the Brother Eye, which would monitor the Justice League of America and fellow super-powered civilians. This, surprise-surprise, would fall into the villainous hands of businessman Maxwell Lord, who would hijack the machine and create killer robots to battle the team. Justice League: Mortal somewhat oddly positioned The Flash as its central character, who would later sacrifice his life to save the day in the film’s final face-off. In addition, as Maxwell Lord actor Jay Baruchel told the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Superman would turn evil over the course of the film and battle Wonder Woman. “I turn him into full red-eye Superman,” Baruchel recalled. “And then there’s this big-ass fight between him and Wonder Woman, where he breaks her f------ wrists and s---, and then I die halfway through the movie, and then my consciousness is uploaded into a f------ mainframe and I’m an evil computer.” Production art, prosthetic tests and storyboards have leaked over the years, one by artist Steve Skroce depicting the aforementioned Superman/Wonder Woman fight (though he has since deleted the images), and others depicting Aquaman in costume and Wonder Woman’s home of Themyscira. A  has been in the works for years, and will hopefully see light of day when filmmaker Ryan Unicomb manages to get permission to use characters and images from Warner Bros. This incarnation of Justice League was developed at a particularly hopeful time for DC Comics and Warner Bros, who had achieved success with Batman Begins, the first entry in Christopher Nolan’s acclaimed Batman trilogy, and were about to launch a fresh take on the Superman mythos courtesy of Bryan Singer. In September 2007, inspired by the Mulroney script, Miller had signed on to direct the superhero team-up movie, and quickly began to assemble his cast. Looking back at the various breathless casting reports at the time is like taking a glance at the young Hollywood of 2007 in microcosm. There was Adam Brody, fresh from his role in The OC. Jessica Biel and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were both linked to Wonder Woman; the cast of Friday Night Lights read for numerous roles; and rapper Common auditioned at a time when he was eager to break into acting. One-time big-deals including Shannyn Sossamon, Michael Angarano and Joseph Cross were also accounted for during auditions. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Miller was specifically looking for young actors who would be able to “grow into their roles over the course of several movies.” They were also noticeably less expensive than the ensembles of Batman Begins and Superman Returns. Ultimately cast were Armie Hammer (long before his  ) as Batman, TV actor DJ Cotrona as Superman, Australian model Megan Gale as Wonder Woman, Common as Green Lantern, Brody as The Flash, the late Anton Yelchin as his nephew Wally West, Heroes actor Santiago Cabrera as Aquaman and the lateGeorge Miller regular Hugh Keays-Byrne as the Martian Manhunter. Other roles cast included The Big Sick’s Zoe Kazan as The Flash’s love interest Iris Allen, Stephen Tobolowsky as Alfred Pennyworth, Teresa Palmer as Talia al Ghul and Judd Apatow regular Jay Baruchel as villain Maxwell Lord. As Hammer told Vulture in 2010, Miller’s pre-production work on the film had been extensive. “They had pre-vizzed a lot of the special-effects sequences, and we saw some of the fight sequences without even having filmed them yet.” He continued: “There was a giant room that he had turned into the storyboard room — this huge conference room that had floor-to-ceiling storyboards on the walls — and you’d start at one point and just walk around the entire room and by the time you were done, it was frame-for-frame the entire movie. We saw it on paper and we were going to bring it to life, we just never got the chance.” The actors had also tried on their costumes, with Hammer describing his Batman costume as having been made from incredibly luxury fabrics. “His utility belt was made from the finest Italian leather and highly polished, and the things that would come out of his forearm, they were titanium but wrapped in very fine leather.” He also revealed that his Batman would have been the first to be able to turn his head in his cowl. An impending writer’s strike had rushed the film into production based on just a few drafts of a script, but as work began, Warner Bros reportedly got cold feet. There had long been concerns about a Justice League movie potentially confusing the marketplace, particularly as the trilogy was in full swing. That had been publicly exacerbated months earlier, when Batman star Christian Bale told reporters that he had not been contacted to play the Caped Crusader in the film, and declared that “It’d be better if [Justice League] doesn’t tread on the toes of what our Batman series is doing.” According to the New York Times, the Mulroneys journeyed to Australia in March 2008 to work on the script with Miller, amid concerns that “the screenplay did not quite meet the challenge of introducing a new series without undercutting the old ones.” The delay in production also meant options on the cast lapsed, allowing them to sign up to other work. This wasn’t a pressing concern, however, as they had reportedly bonded with Miller during trips to his Australian home and were all eager to film the movie. But another problem was on the horizon: namely that the film could no longer be shot in Australia. Miller, who has rarely directed films outside of his native country, was counting on a 40 per cent tax rebate from the Australian government, who would help finance the film in exchange for the work the project would bring to the country. At a reported cost of $250 million, Justice League would have been largely unthinkable without state help. Australia’s federal government eventually declared Justice League would not receive the 40% rebate, citing a perceived lack of Australian actors in the main cast (that was despite Gale, Palmer and Keays-Byrne all hailing from Down Under). As a result, Warner Bros suspended production. An outraged Miller told the Sydney Morning Herald: “A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Australian film industry is being frittered away because of very lazy thinking. If that’s going to be the final decision, they’re throwing away hundreds of millions of dollars of investment that the rest of the world is competing for and, much more significantly, highly skilled creative jobs.” In light of the decision, production was moved to Canada, with Warner Bros aiming to start shooting in July 2008 for a summer 2009 release. But July came and went, and on the heels of the enormous critical and commercial success of Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, released that month, Warner Bros and DC decided to regroup. “We’re not off the notion of a Justice League,” president of WB production Jeff Robinov told Variety at the time. “There’s a massive interest and knowledge in the comic book industry and it takes time to sort of catch up and understand the characters and the history, where they’ve intersected with each other and what their worlds are. That’s part of the education that we’re going through.” The senior VP of creative affairs for DC Comics, Gregory Noveck, added: “These are big, iconic characters. So when you make them into a movie, you’d better be shooting for a pretty high standard. You’re not always going to reach it, but you have to be shooting for it. We’re going to make a Justice League movie, whether it’s now or 10 years from now. But we’re not going to do it and Warners is not going to do it until we know it’s right.” By the end of 2008, Justice League was as good as dead, and Miller announced on Australian television that he had left the project. Declaring that he was no longer involved “in any capacity”, he also implied that the low-wattage of the cast was also a factor, claiming that the studio “seems to want bigger stars in their superhero movies now.” In the years that have passed, several cast members have spoken about the project, with a mix of both sadness over what they felt was a missed opportunity, as well as a slight shrug over its eventual demise. “For a long time, I was like, ‘How great that could have been!’” Hammer told Vulture. “[But] as a 31-year-old who’s been through a lot since I was 19, I wouldn’t want to watch a 19-year-old Batman. I’d be like, ‘Who’s this spoiled rich kid who wants to play dress-up?’” “I used to be upset we didn’t get to do it, but everything happens exactly as it’s supposed to,” he continued. “I still have a lot of learning to do about this, and it’s a constant pursuit for me. If I had been that successful right out of the gate, I would have thought I already understood it all. I know that I wouldn’t have turned in a great performance, or even a good performance — it would have just been whatever. So I’m glad.” “It was a great script, and it was a great director,” Adam Brody told HeyUGuys in 2013. “I’m not saying it would have changed the world, but that movie would have worked, I will say that. [It] would have been a nice little movie I think, but they [Warner Brothers] just didn’t want to cross their streams with a whole bunch of Batmans in the universe and all the other reasons they didn’t make it. “I will say that I don’t have any particular affinity for the Flash. I grew up reading comic books, and loving them, and I still have a fondness for them. Although the older I get, the more saturated the marketplace gets, I find the less I care as a whole.” Even Miller has been slightly “meh” on its lack of existence. “It was very faithful to the comics at the time, very DCU,” he told the Word Balloon podcast. “Ultimately I think it’s good that it didn’t come out as there were some parts that were cool that they got right and there were some things that people were going to hate. Some of it was very aimed at kids.” Speaking to Australia’s Channel Nine, Gale had a slightly warmer response: “As long as my son thinks I’m Wonder Woman [I'm fine],” Gale told “If that means I’m ‘super-mum’, I’m fine.” Along with crediting the film for her friendship with Miller, who would later cast her in Mad Max: Fury Road, she also spoke proudly of a photograph she took in costume that was leaked online in 2015. “It was a really lovely surprise, because I hadn’t seen it for seven years. We were just doing costume trials. We just did full dress, costume and hair and wardrobe, and we did a photo shoot. But I’m glad that we got that far into production that we had those photos!” Miller’s departure from Justice League was met with odd celebration by fans, who had taken to slamming the director as “just the guy who did Happy Feet” and mocking his casting choices. The fresh-faced, all-American Hammer, then a complete unknown, had been repeatedly dubbed “Frat-Man”. “Since he was announced as the director of Justice League, I’ve grown to dislike him and his idiotic casting choices,” wrote Alex Billington of First Showing in 2008. “I couldn’t be happier that he’s no longer involved!” In hindsight, such a reaction is slightly embarrassing. On paper, Justice League: Mortal had story issues, while the timing of its intended release and its lack of relationship with the Nolan trilogy indicated a lack of thinking on the part of Warner Bros bosses… something that has been replicated ever since. But Miller would also go on to direct one of the 21st century’s most relentlessly exciting and justifiably heralded blockbusters in the form of Mad Max: Fury Road, and it remains intriguing to imagine what he would have done with the superhero genre. In light of Zack Snyder’s nonsensically grim adaptations and the Joss Whedon snark crudely stuck onto it with scotch tape, it really couldn’t have been much worse. “It was allegorical, like a story of Greek Gods almost,” Cotrona told Slashfilm in 2015. “He was doing things with the Superman character and Batman character, and all the iconic favourites, that’s never been done before. Watch Fury Road and you can only imagine what he would do with those iconic characters.”",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/live-let-die-roger-moore-yaphet-kotto-bond-blaxploitation/,culture,"For  ’s first appearance as   in 1973, MGM went out of their way to make him as unlike his predecessor as possible. This suave new spy drank gin-and-tonics (not vodka martinis), smoked cigars (not cigarettes), and – in a feat zanier than anything ever attempted by Sean Connery – used killer reptiles as stepping stones. In Live and Let Die’s most famous set-piece, 007 runs across the backs of a line of crocodiles. It wasn’t the real 007, but they were certainly real crocs. While scouting for locations in Jamaica’s Montego Bay, the producers had driven past a curious sign: “Trespassers will be eaten”. It marked the entrance to a crocodile farm owned by a man called Ross Kananga. The crew decided to give Kananga a role as Moore’s stunt double for a scene at his ranch, rather than risk a member of their cast or crew to the critters’ snapping jaws. Wearing a pair of crocodile-skin shoes (a joke suggested by Moore), Kananga completed the death-defying dash in just five takes. The producers were so impressed by Kananga that appropriated his name for the film's chief villain, played by the black actor Yaphet Kotto – in another sign that this wasn't Connery's 007, he would be the first black Bond villain. But the role proved to be a mixed blessing for Kotto, who has died at the age of 81. Although Bond was eventually good for his career and led to roles in Alien and Raid on Entebbe, he later complained of feeling sidelined on-set and was all but shut out of the film's publicity campaign. ""The producers did not want to promote me in the film,"" he said in 2007. ""In fact, I found out that Time magazine and Newsweek were interviewing the rest of the cast. I went to [producer] Harry Saltzman and said, 'Why wasn't I included?' 'We were afraid that there's never been a black villain before. We don't want people to think stuff.' So they didn't promote me."" The producers, essentially, feared a backlash if the public found out that their villain was black. The making of the film itself was just as problematic, with not every scene going as smoothly as the crocodile hopping. It took no fewer than 29 takes to film the moment when Bond uses his magnetic watch to unzip a dress worn by buxom Italian agent Miss Caruso (Madeline Smith). This might explain why their love-scene is one of the more stilted encounters in the Bond canon, but the lengthy shoot wasn’t the only mood-killer. According to Smith, Moore’s wife Luisa Mattioli insisted on supervising the scene, keeping a chilly eye on her to make sure there was absolutely no funny business. Moore would hardly have been in the mood, anyway: during the shoot, he was hospitalised with a painful bout of kidney stones. He was put on an a new medication to deal with them, but the pills left him with a woozy head – and bright blue urine. “I was still zonked out and in unfamiliar surroundings, so when I got up for a pee at two in the morning, I opened what I thought was the bathroom door when it was the wardrobe and relieved myself,” he told the Mail. “'The next morning I discovered my mistake when I found my lovely clothes had turned various shades of patchy blue!” Elsewhere, filming was beset by problems. One actor was bitten by a snake, which escaped his grasp and slithered over defenceless actress Jane Seymour (who was tied between two bedposts at the time) before it was recaptured. In filming a thrilling water-chase Moore’s boat veered out of control and crashed through a boathouse wall, twisting his knee and cracking his teeth. “There I was, a fearless 007, hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras,"" he recalled in his autobiography. “Who says I can't act?” The actor also managed to keep his cool when faced with a trapdoor that looked likely to decapitate anyone who used it. But only after he insisted that the door’s designer John Wardley should test it out first. Wardley remembered the scene in an interview with the Huffington Post’s Mike Peake: “[What] proved to me what a cool guy Roger Moore was, is a scene in a bar called the Fillet of Soul run by the villains. There is a table that disappears into the ground once Bond sits at it. This mechanism was quite a sturdy piece of equipment and the director insisted that the sliding floor should come across rapidly as the table disappears. It whistled across your forehead and slammed shut. We designed this contraption and all in all there was about three tons of steel in it. “The director said to Moore, ‘Whatever you do, you must not flinch’, at which point Moore turned to me and said, ‘I’ll do one take – but I want to see him’, pointing at me, ‘do it first.’ So I did, and it was pretty frightening. He then did it, and he did not bat an eyelid.” Although the risky action sequences and rogue reptiles caused a headache for producers, the real snake in the grass turned out to be the film’s casting. With the film’s action moving between New York's Harlem, Louisiana and the Caribbean, Live and Let Die was the franchise’s attempt to cash in on the burgeoning Blaxploitation genre, following the recent success of Shaft (1971) and Super Fly (1972). It was intended to be a bold departure from previous Bond films, an idea winked at in the script. In one scene, Moore starts to introduce himself with Connery’s catchphrase (“My name is…”) only to be cut off by Kotto's Harlem gangster and master of disguise Mr Big, aka Dr Kananga: “Names is for tombstones, baby.” As well as the franchise’s first major black villain, the film also starred – to the distaste of a few bigoted audience members in America’s Deep South – its first black Bond girl. “As Bond, I make love to Rosie Carver, played by beautiful black actress Gloria Hendry, and Luisa [Mattioli] has learned from certain Louisiana ladies that if there is a scene like that they won’t go to see the picture,” Moore wrote in his 1973 James Bond Diary (now sadly out of print). He continued: “I personally don’t give a damn and it makes me all the more determined to play the scene.” Regardless of Moore’s views, many of the choices made during the production now seem shockingly insensitive. The original script featured a major role for an African-American actress as Bond’s main love interest: Obeah mystic and tarot-card reader Solitaire. At one point Diana Ross was among the stars considered for the part. But the producers got cold feet, recasting the role at the last minute – perhaps over concerns about the worldwide box office. At the time, any films depicting an interracial relationship were still banned in several territories, including Japan and South Africa. “While filming somewhere in New York City or New Orleans, they decided that it was too risky to have a black woman end up with James Bond,” Hendry said in a 2004 interview. “Therefore, the [smaller, supporting] role of Rosie Carver was switched to black, and the role of Solitaire was switched to white. That is where I came in.” The producers didn’t feel it was worth their time to find a realistic stunt double for Hendry, and resorted to the controversial practice of  . For one bedroom scene, “They ended up having a white British gentleman in brown makeup with a dress and an Afro wig,” Hendry has recalled. Yaphet Kotto, meanwhile, was not invited to the premiere and and celebrated the film's release with friends in a Harlem bar. “They were afraid the public would react negatively to a black villain so they didn’t play my character up,” he told the Big Issue in 2015. “That hurt me a lot, man. I went through a lot of goddamn emotional hell because they were afraid people would be angry that a black guy was not being Sidney Poitier. I was the opposite of everything he created.” Earlier, Kotto had claimed the producers essentially ""set me up"" and portrayed him as a rabble-rouser: ""One of the actors raised a clenched fist, saluting me, so I raised my clenched fist, and a photographer swiveled around and said, 'You're a militant SOB' and took my picture and gave that to the producers. I had promised Dr. King – I was with him at a couple of demonstrations – that I would never do anything militant. So they had me pegged wrong."" Although the film’s racial politics can look seriously dated today (not to mention its villain's bizarre, flatulent death scene), Kotto felt that having such a formidable black character in a world-straddling franchise “would open up the doors for others – and it worked"". The actor had some personal experience to prove it: he was later offered the role of Captain Picard in Star Trek, but turned it down. He was less positive about his co-star. ""I have nothing to say about Roger Moore,"" he told an interviewer in 2007.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/sinto-steal-pet-shop-boys-hit-single-ignited-music-industrys/,culture,", Channel 4’s drama about a group of gay friends in the Eighties as the  appears on the horizon, has been receiving rave reviews for its humanity, heart and humour. But the   song after which the hit show is named can lay claim to its own dramatic story, albeit one that is more bonkers than poignant. It’s a Sin was the second UK number one single for the deadpan synth-pop duo, often dubbed the Gilbert and George of pop. The song topped the charts for three weeks in July 1987. A gloriously over-the-top track that featured a NASA countdown, claps of thunder, choral chanting and quotes from the Latin Mass, It’s a Sin marked the peak of what Pet Shop Boys’ singer Neil Tennant would memorably call the band’s “imperial phase”. It also had one of the most catchy synth hooks of the decade. But in what must rank as one of the most bizarre incidents in the colourful world of 1980s pop, the song saw the Pet Shop Boys accused of plagiarism by the (since disgraced) columnist and music mogul Jonathan King. King very publicly claimed that It’s a Sin had stolen its melody from Cat Stevens’ 1970 hit Wild World. Not content with baselessly accusing the band, King recorded his own version of Wild World in the high-energy style of It’s a Sin and released it as a single. Its sleeve ruthlessly parodied the cover of the Pet Shop Boys’ accompanying album Actually. The band sued King for libel, but not before Stevens himself got involved. In a decade known for excess and silliness, few stories were as downright odd as this. “There are a lot of very strange episodes in the wonderful world of pop, but I do remember this,” recalls Barry McIlheney, who was editor of Smash Hits at the time. “The Pet Shop Boys were flying high. The two records didn’t sound particularly alike to me. If you’re going to claim that It’s a Sin is based on Wild World then I don’t know where you begin with a lot of others.” In the summer of 1987 the Pet Shop Boys were on a roll. Their debut album, Please, had been a commercial success the previous year and had spawned their first number one single, West End Girls. It’s a Sin was the first single from the follow-up studio album, Actually. Speaking to Smash Hits (a magazine where he coincidentally used to work) in August 1987, Tennant seemed genuinely surprised at It’s a Sin’s chart success. “I didn’t expect It’s a Sin to get to number one. We always expect our records to be huge, disastrous flops. So I was thrilled to pieces. Two number ones – it’s a proper thing. Have one number one and you’re a one-hit wonder. But have two…,” the singer said. Just as the Pet Shop Boys were enjoying this first flush of fame as copper-bottomed “proper” pop stars, King sought to dislodge their crown. Jonathan King was at the time a famously outspoken character in the British music world. (He was jailed in 2001 for child sex offences). He’d been a singer himself and had seen success with a song called Everyone’s Gone to the Moon in 1965. He’d then become a producer, discovering Genesis, and founded his own record label, UK Records. By the mid-1980s, King had become a well-known broadcaster and media commentator with a regular pop column in The Sun newspaper. And it was to The Sun’s four million readers that King made his claims about the Pet Shop Boys’ alleged plagiarism. “When It’s a Sin went to number one Jonathan King wrote about it in his column in The Sun, suggesting they had committed an act of theft from Cat Stevens and that they should by punished for it,” recalled Chris Heath in his 1990 Pet Shop Boys’ biography, Literally. Other newspapers picked up the allegation, with one journalist contacting Stevens­ – who by then had converted to the Muslim faith and changed his name to Yusuf Islam – for a comment. The singer told the reporter that he wasn’t bothered. But when King repeated the plagiarism claim on the radio, Tennant and bandmate Chris Lowe instigated defamation proceedings. Recalling the events in his diary, Tennant wrote: “One of the most ancient clichés of the music business is ‘Where there’s a hit, there’s a writ’. In 1987 Jonathan King announced on the radio and in his column in The Sun that It’s a Sin was copied from Cat Stevens’ Wild World. We ended up starting to sue King for libel.” It would be reasonable to assume that anyone making a plagiarism claim would have piped down once legal proceedings had been initiated and after the writer of the song alleged to have been copied had shrugged the issue off. Not King. He doubled down. In a hubristic attempt to support his claims, King recorded a single of Wild World to It’s a Sin’s arrangement, down to the choral chants, the thunder clap, the pulsating disco beat and the synth hook. King’s opening vocal lines of ‘Now that I’ve lost everything to you / You say you wanna start something new’ were delivered in a staccato style that mimicked Tennant’s ‘When I look back upon my life / It’s always with a sense of shame.’ As King approached the chorus, he mashed-up the two songs he was conflating. ‘It’s a / It’s a / It’s a / It’s a Wild World,’ he sang. Things got stranger in the spoken-word breakdown (the bit in the original that begins ‘Father forgive me’). King changed the words to: ‘Stevens forgive them / They don’t know what they’re doing / So now they are suing.’ He goes on to make what appears to be sexually suggestive remark about the pair. He didn’t stop here. The sleeve of King’s Wild World single featured a pastiche of Tennant and Lowe on the cover of Actually. On the real album, the pair were famously pictured sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in tuxedos looking bored. King’s sleeve used computer trickery to sit him and Stevens next to each other in tuxedos in precisely the same position. The song title was subheaded: ‘Actually, It’s a sin – to steal.’ Just to make sure that his message wasn’t lost, King’s B-side was a medley of the Chiffons’ He’s So Fine with George Harrison’s My Sweet Lord. Back in 1976, Harrison’s song was found by a US judge to have borrowed from The Chiffons’ song when he wrote his own. The ex-Beatle paid damages to the song’s copyright holder. King’s point was as subtle as a sledgehammer. But it didn’t work. The single bombed. Far more importantly, though, repeating the allegations on an actual record did nothing to help King’s case. Listening today, the songs don’t really match. “If anything it weakened his case,” wrote Heath. McIlheney’s recollection of the episode no doubt mirrored the thoughts of many people in the pop world. “I am sure that at the time we would have been very much on Neil’s side. Partly because of his relationship with Smash Hits, partly because the Pet Shop Boys were a fantastic act and partly because Jonathan King would have been regarded with suspicion,” he says. The case took a twist when Islam himself offered to intervene on behalf of the Pet Shop Boys. Tennant recalls: “Yusuf Islam wrote us a very charming letter offering to mediate at one point.” I approached the Pet Shop Boys’ camp, asking for further details of this letter but to no avail. Yet ultimately the Wild World writer’s help wasn’t needed. King settled out of court. At the band’s request he made a donation to the Jefferiss Research Foundation, which researched sexual health and sexually transmitted infections. In diaries published online a few years ago, Tennant likened the case to when guitarist Joe Satriani claimed that Coldplay had copied their song Viva La Vida from a track of his called If I Could Fly. (The case was dismissed by a US judge but it is not known if whether an out-of-court settlement of any kind was made). Tennant noted that Islam had remarked in an interview that the Coldplay song also sounded like one of his from the 1970s. “We hadn’t stolen It’s a Sin from Wild World and I don’t imagine that Chris Martin of Coldplay has copied his song from either Satriani or Stevens. It is possible to write a song based on a strong, logical chord change with a melody line that follows the chord change and so come up with something new that can coincidentally sound like another song which you may never have heard,” Tennant wrote. “For years we used to perform a medley of It’s a Sin and I Will Survive just because the chord changes were so similar.” McIlheney says that the mid-to-late Eighties were a “golden era” for British pop. The “frenetic and relentless” scene was bursting with stars, from stalwarts like the Pet Shop Boys and George Michael to emerging boy bands Bros and Brother Beyond to singers from Stock Aitken Waterman’s ‘Hit Factory’ such as Rick Astley, Mel and Kim, and Kylie Minogue. The industry was awash with money and huge egos. It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that things like the It’s a Sin/ Wild World episode should emerge from the melee. The biggest testament to the greatness of the Pet Shop Boys’ song is that it still sounds like a classic 34 years on, whereas the King controversy is largely a forgotten footnote. And yet, we know that the daft cover version lives on in at least one record collection. According to the Pet Shop Boys’ biographer Heath, Chris Lowe bought a copy of King’s record “because he liked it”. Now that really is a sin.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/nicolas-cages-superman-lives-had-die/,culture,"In the summer of 1996, Kevin Smith met producer  to talk about the script for Superman Lives – the long-in-development, ultimately-abandoned blockbuster that was, at different stages, set to be written by Smith, directed by Tim Burton, and star . At Peters’ Los Angeles home – which Smith likened to Wayne Manor (Peters had also produced the 1989 version of Batman) – he told Smith there were three rules which must be followed for this updated  story. “One, I don’t want to see him in that suit,” said Peters (according to Smith) about the most iconic threads in pop culture history. “Two, I don’t want to see him fly. And three, he’s got to fight a giant spider in the third act…” Twenty-five years on, that giant spider is like the monstrous manifestation of Superman’s battle with Hollywood – a battle to not only put Superman on the big screen, but to get Superman right. It’s a battle which has left a trail of abandoned, unmade films behind him like a discarded cape. The latest of these almost-were films,   – AKA “The Snyder Cut” – has finally become a reality, following a   in support of Snyder’s vision for the DC ensemble. But Snyder’s retooled, four-hour Justice League is puny compared to the legend of Superman Lives, embodied by the image Nic Cage in leaked test shots – donning a revamped suit, a shoulder length wig, with a sleeker ‘S’ logo emblazoned across the chest, and no red pants – like the biggest “What if?” and “WTF?” in cinema history. Indeed, Superman Lives may be the greatest blockbuster never made – the mightiest, most notorious movie to die a painful, drawn-out death in the fires of Development Hell. So notorious is Superman Lives that a documentary was released in 2015, directed by the late Jon Schnepp – The Death of Superman Lives: What Happened? Even now, in the age of the 23-movie Marvel Universe, Superman Lives looks like a massively ambitious movie extravaganza at the dawn of digital effects. The project, which underwent various scripts and phases, was inspired by the early 1990s “Death of Superman” comic book storyline, in which DC killed off and resurrected the Man of Steel – a crafty ploy to boost flagging comic sales.  The film would have included the alien Brainiac – a top-tier villain in the comics – baldy arch-nemesis Lex Luthor, and Doomsday, the monster who killed Superman. The concept of the unfinished, troubled, or cobbled-together Superman film goes back further than Justice League or Superman Lives. Before “The Snyder Cut” there was the “Donner Cut” – a much-hyped alternative version of 1980’s Superman II. Richard Donner – original director of the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman films – was fired mid-production and replaced by Richard Lester. But Donner returned to piece together his version of Superman II for a 2006 DVD. There were other almost-made Christopher Reeve stories. An early outline for 1983’s Superman III, written by producer Ilya Salkind, features Supergirl, Brainiac, and inter-dimensional trickster Mr Mxyzptlk. It ends with Superman and Brainiac jousting on horseback and Mr Mxyzptlk turning the world into a giant puzzle – vastly different but no less daft than the Richard Pryor vehicle that Superman III eventually became. For Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, the producers licensed the rights to  , purveyors of stack ‘em high, make ‘em cheap films, the most notorious of which are Masters of the Universe and, erm, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.  The film was hit with budget problems. As the legend goes, around 45 minutes has never been seen. One fight sequence featured Casualty’s Clive Mantle as a simple-minded super villain – a prototype of the finished film’s “Nuclear Man”. Canon announced Superman V, but planned to make the film with the unused Superman IV footage. With the character back in the hands of father-son producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind, another version of Superman V was pitched, which would have sensibly ignored Superman III and IV and featured Brainiac (him again) shrinking Metropolis into a bottle. The next figure to take on the Man of Steel was Jon Peters, who picked up the rights from the Salkinds – apparently swiping the option from under Warner Bros’s nose. Peters is a former hairdresser who has a rep for having a violent temper, shouting down subordinates, and crowbarring terrible ideas into movies. Peters originally got into the business through his relationship with Barbara Streisand. “He used to be Barbara Streisand’s hairdresser and then one day he became a producer,” said Kevin Smith in 2002. “Because in Hollywood you just kinda fail upwards.” An entire book – Hit & Run by Nancy Griffin and Kim Masters – was written about how Peters and his partner Peter Gruber (“his soulless soul mate”) landed top jobs at Sony and ran the studio into the ground with excess and bluster. At first, Peters' project was titled “Superman Reborn” – “Might as well have said ‘Superman remarketed for a new generation,’” Smith told Jon Schnepp – and went through two script drafts. The first, by Jonathan Lemkin, would have seen Superman killed and literally reborn, with his spirit attaching to Lois Lane’s still-gestating baby; the second draft, by Gregory Poirier (a former porn movie writer who used the pseudonym Hugh Jorgan) was a campy send-up in which Clark Kent goes to a psychiatrist to unload the problems of being Superman. At the time – following the success of Clerks and with Chasing Amy about to be released – Kevin Smith was the sharpest voice in nerd cinema and then-King of the Comic Book Geeks. He convinced executives to let him write Superman. Kevin Smith recalled Peters reaching for some solidarity, claiming that they’d make Superman a success because “we’re from the streets”. Smith – from suburban, middle class New Jersey – doubted the street credentials of the perfectly coiffured producer. But it’s a self-image that Peters has maintained. “I’ve been in 500 fights,” Peters told Jon Schnepp. As an amusing footnote, Peters was also set to produce Under Siege 2, but disagreements almost led to a punch-up with Steve Seagal. After writing his first draft, Kevin Smith was summoned by Peters – this time, bizarrely, to read him out the screenplay aloud. Smith recalled Peters laying back on his sofa and creating a frame with his hands director-style, making an imaginary screen in which he could visualise the action as it was being told to him. In The Death of Superman Lives, Peters denies telling Smith that Superman shouldn’t wear the suit or fly (though other writers recalled similar instructions). But Peters readily admits demanding the giant spider battle. Smith placated Peters and dubbed his deadly arachnid a “Thanagarian Snare Beast”. Across two drafts, Smith had to include more of Peters’ ideas: a polar bear action scene at the Fortress of Solitude, and a gay sidekick robot for Brainiac. Peters also wanted Sean Penn for Superman because he “had the eyes of a killer”. Smith admitted that his Superman Lives script was pure fan fiction. “It was one of those jobs where you’re just like f––– it, write your dream movie,” he told Jon Schnepp. The script was packed with references and characters from the DC Comics-verse. Batman gives a eulogy at Superman’s funeral. In the pre-Marvel movie era, that kind of crossover cameo would have melted the brain of the average fan. Smith recommended Tim Burton as director, not realising that he was effectively firing himself. Burton didn’t like Smith’s script and brought in Wesley Strick to rewrite the script. New elements included the merging of Lex Luthor and Brainiac – creating a double-faced monster named Lexiac – and the robot companion “K” for Superman. Burton was a likely choice. With 1989’s  he had reinvented the Dark Knight and made Warner Bros half a billion dollars. In 1996, Mars Attacks had been a box office dud in the US, but Burton was still a curious, fantastical visionary in mainstream cinema – not yet saddled with the likes of his Planet of the Apes “reimagining”. Burton had little reverence for the Superman mythology and latched onto the idea of the genial, wholesome Superman/Clark Kent as the ultimate outsider – a literal alien. Twenty-five years later, it’s fascinating to imagine how the brighter, primary-coloured world of Superman would have melded with Burton’s twisted, gothic style.   Burton was wary of Jon Peters, with whom he clashed and kept at arms length on Batman. Wesley Strick recalled that Burton filmed Batman in England partly to get away from Peters. “Like force of nature,” said Burton about the producer. “It’s like trying to control the weather.” But it was Peters who suggested the Superman Lives project’s real masterstroke – Nicolas Cage as the Man of Steel. Cage is a lifelong fan (he named his son Kal-El, after Supes’ Kryptonian birth name) and offered to play Luthor or Brainiac before signing up as Superman. Cage seems like a leftfield choice – especially now, after 20-odd years of him wavering between mainstream films, oddball indies, and straight-to-DVD tat – but in 1996 he won an Academy Award, and in the middle of his Holy Trinity of Nineties action: The Rock, Face/Off and Con Air. Cage was planning to go full Nic Cage as Superman. “I was going to turn that character upside down,” Cage later said. Other cast members were lined up: the now-banished Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor – a role he played in 2006’s Superman Returns; Chris Rock as Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen; and Christopher Walken as Brainiac. As recalled by Jake Rossen in his book Superman vs. Hollywood, there were some doubts among Warner Bros execs about Cage, and doubters from the fan community hit the geek-centric message boards – a precursor to the rabid internet negativity that surrounds modern franchises. Most controversial – and indicative of how Burton intended to change Superman – was the outfit. In the script, the robot companion attaches to the now-dead Superman like a suit, changing as he regenerates and evolves, until finally Superman dons an updated version of his threads. Several suits were made: silicone biomechanical suits, muscle suits, vacuum-formed suits with laser-powered fibre optic lights – with a distinct lack of red pants. The Superman Lives story is best remembered for that test image of Cage in the upgraded suit, but other test images – with Cage in the more traditional Superman gear – are undeniably tantalising. Burton had a small army of concept artists and effects wizards working on pre-production. As seen in The Death of Superman Lives doc, the design work is vast and otherworldly: monsters, robots, spaceships, bizarre-looking Kryptonians. Jake Rossen noted that merchandise tie-ins were a huge factor – characters and gadgets were geared towards potential toys. The design team experienced the full force of Jon Peters, who would storm in, usually with an entourage of women and children, and show off his new jujitsu moves. “Sometimes he’d get somebody in a headlock,” Burton told Jon Schnepp. “One time he kissed me full on the lips. Now which is better? I don’t know. I think I might have preferred the headlock, or a kick to the face.” Peters explained his macho posturing as “creating an energy of an action hero.” He had more bonkers ideas: he wanted Superman to use his cape like a deadly boomerang, and Brainiac to drive through space in a giant skull. Burton recalled pressure to include Superman having a kung fu fight against a band of ninjas, which sounds decidedly like the “Biff!” and “Ka-Pow!” cartoon violence from the Sixties Batman series Sets were built across soundstages at a cost of $20 million, and Pittsburgh was scouted as a stand-in for Metropolis. But Warner Bros executives were nervous about the script, and yet another writer was brought in – this time Dan Gilroy, writer and director of 2014 Oscar-winner Nightcrawler. Warner Bros had suffered a string of duds – money-losers such as Kevin Costner’s The Postman, and the franchise-zapping embarrassment of Batman & Robin. The studio estimated that Superman Lives would cost $140 million – though Jon Peters reckoned closer to $300 million with marketing and other expenses – which forced Gilroy to scale down the action. Finally, in late 1998, Warner Bros killed Superman Lives. In the aftermath, there were other attempts to resurrect the Last Son of Krypton: a Batman vs. Superman project by Wolfgang Petersen, which at one stage was tipped to star Jude Law as Superman and Colin Farrell as Batman; and a JJ Abrams-written project, dubbed Superman: FlyBy, which had McG and  attached as directors at different times. In one version of the script, Lex Luthor was a CIA Agent and secret Kryptonian, and Superman’s suit came out of a can. Warner Bros finally re-launched the Man of Steel with Bryan Singer’s Superman Returns in 2006 – not a reinvention, but a sentimental nod to the Christopher Reeve films. Singer reportedly kept a photo of Nic Cage as Superman to hand, and pulled it out as a shield against criticism – proof of what was narrowly avoided. To my mind Superman Returns is an underappreciated gem, though not everyone agrees. “Remember the first movie where ‘You’ll believe a man can fly?’” said Kevin Smith in a live show. “This movie’s going to be 'You won’t believe how f–––––– boring this man is.'” A Returns sequel was sort-of planned but scrapped. In 2007, Warner Bros developed then binned  , which would have been directed by Mad Max maestro George Miller and starred DJ Cotrona as Superman and Armie Hammer as Batman. Jon Peters didn’t get his reinvented version of Superman, but he did get his giant spider. A giant mechanical spider would show up for the climactic battle of the Peters-produced Wild Wild West, which bombed in 1999 – the year after Superman Lives was canceled. Speaking at the Toronto Film festival in 2017, Nicolas Cage gave his take on Superman Lives. “I would offer that the movie that Tim and I would have made, in your imagination, is more powerful than any of the Superman movies,” he said. “I didn’t even have to make the movie and we all know what that movie would have been in your imagination. That is the Superman. That is the movie. Even though you never saw it — it is the Superman.” The reputation of Superman Lives is all the more powerful for never being made. It’s hard to imagine the film that Burton envisioned, at the dawn of digital effects, standing the test of time. Attempts to reinvent, redefine, or make Superman “real” – the worst offender being one that actually made it to the big screen: Zack Snyder's dreadful Man of Steel – have missed the point of the character.  Superman should be the purest, most straightforward to adapt of all the superheroes, which is why the original Christopher Reeve-starring Superman has never been bettered – by any superhero film. It remains the template, with the most heart and ingenuity. As proved by Man of Steel, which took a cue from Superman Lives and ditched the red undies, Superman needs the pants.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/young-sherlock-holmes-ahead-time-did-conan-doyle-purists-hate/,culture,"At just 18 years old, actor Nicholas Rowe got to live a dream scenario for any Eighties movie fan – hanging out at the headquarters of Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment, in the backlot of Universal Studios, playing video games and watching movies.  “I remember playing video games while standing next to Bob Zemeckis,” laughs Rowe, recalling his brush with the director of Back to the Future and  . It was 1985, and Rowe had been cast as the lead in the Amblin-produced adventure, Young . It was the absolute peak moment for Amblin’s output – three years after ET and Poltergeist, a year after Gremlins, and the same year as The Goonies and Back to the Future.  Behind Young Sherlock was a team of Hollywood heavyweights; the film was executive produced by Spielberg, directed by Barry Levinson, and written by Chris Columbus. But Rowe, now 54, admits that he wasn’t up to date on his Spielberg adventures. “I hadn’t seen ET by that time,” he says, “which was a shock to one of the Spielberg people working at Amblin. They said, ‘Don’t tell Steven that! Just sit in the movie theatre and we’ll set it up.’ So I sat and watched ET on my own in this 30-seater theatre, with some popcorn from the machine, and the controls and a phone right by me. I had everything I needed. I was thinking life doesn’t get better than this.” A sound knowledge of Eighties cinema was likely imperative. Young Sherlock Holmes is pure Amblin fodder – a coming-of-age adventure with gadgets, little monsters, and Spielbergian spirit. A Victorian Goonies, perhaps. It’s no great mystery: Chris Columbus wrote Gremlins and The Goonies – both were executive produced by Spielberg. What Young Sherlock Holmes isn’t – in a purist-ruffling irony – is a Sherlock Holmes story. Departing from what Sherlockians call “the canon” – the four novels and 56 short stories by  e – it’s more of a swashbuckling Indiana Jones adventure, with ancient evil rituals and industry-changing SFX. “Most Holmesians are, as you might expect, infuriated by the many sizeable liberties the film takes,” says Adrian Braddy, editor of Sherlock Holmes Magazine. “It repeatedly and spectacularly contradicts the canon.” The composite of ideas might explain why Young Sherlock Holmes was a high profile dud for Amblin – even at the height of the mighty Spielberg’s powers. Still, Young Sherlock Holmes holds strong nostalgia for kids of the Eighties. “I am aware that it has a strong place in people’s hearts,” says Nicholas Rowe. “It will probably always have a place somewhere in a cult collection.” The idea of a young Sherlock Holmes wasn’t new. Though not a Holmes story, Buster Keaton imagined himself as a chip of the old Sherlock in the 1924 silent classic, Sherlock Jr. In 1982, ITV aired the largely-forgotten series Young Sherlock: The Mystery of Manor House, starring Guy Henry as the adolescent sleuth. Now, it’s a common theme. There’s a series of Young Sherlock novels by Andrew Lane, and this week Netflix launches a new Sherlock-based teen series,  featuring The Inbetweeners’   as a grungy, emo Holmes. The mid-Eighties was a curious time for Holmes on screen. In 1984, Granada launched the  -starring series – largely considered to be the definitive, most faithful screen version (Brett carried a copy of the canon at all times to ensure fidelity) – and in 1986, Disney released its anthropomorphised version, The Great Mouse Detective. Chris Columbus wanted to pick apart the emotionless core of Sherlock, by reimagining him as a love-struck teenager. He wrote The Goonies by day, and Young Sherlock Holmes by night. “The thing that was most important to me was why Holmes became so cold and calculating, and why he was alone for the rest of his life,'” Columbus told the New York Times. “That's why he is so emotional in the film. As a youngster, he was ruled by emotion, he fell in love with the love of his life, and as a result of what happens in this film, he becomes the person he was later.” It’s dodgy ground even now. Last year the estate of Doyle   for giving Sherlock emotions in Enola Holmes – itself a gender-swap play on Young Sherlock. Columbus commented that he was “very worried about offending some of the Holmes purists”. When Paramount head Michael Eisner green-lit the film, it offended the ultimate Holmes purist: Dame Jean Conan Doyle, the daughter of Sir Arthur. “When Dame Jean read the script, she was aghast at the violent imagery that was intended for young viewers,” says Gus Holwerda, co-host of the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes Podcast. “She was also unhappy at some of the choices that had been written into her father’s characters. As the executor of the Doyle canon, she refused to allow the film to go forward without significant changes. Eisner listened to her concerns, took her council to heart, and hired Sherlockian scholar John Bennett Shaw and novelist Jeffery Archer to revise the script.” (The film is bookended with clunky disclaimers, explaining that it’s not taken from Doyle’s stories, but it's “affectionate speculation” about what Holmes’ youth could have been.) By that point, Barry Levinson’s films had been low-key character dramas – Diner and The Natural. But Spielberg saw Levinson as “a frustrated action-adventure director”. Later, Levinson would direct Good Morning Vietnam, Rain Man (which won four Oscars), and Sleepers. In a 1993 book on his career, Levinson recalled that he was drawn to the Victorian setting (the film was shot around Oxford, various castle locations, and Elstree Studios) and working with child actors, though it was hard finding a solid cast of 16-year-old actors. Levinson looked at audition tapes for 10,000 boys. Nicholas Rowe recalls going for a screen test, along with other young actors who were up for the part. “Hugh Grant was there,” laughs Rowe. “And look what happened to him.” In the film, young Watson (Alan Cox) enrolls at Brompton Academy, where he befriends Holmes. Sherlock shows off his powers of deduction by determining the portly Watson’s favourite tarts, based on the custard stains down his lapel. Along with Elizabeth (Sophie Ward) – Holmes’ doomed sweetheart – they investigate a series of bizarre deaths. Victims are shot with poisoned blow darts and driven to suicide by monstrous hallucinations, including a reanimated roast pheasant and an assortment of come-to-life cakes and confectionary (created by stop-motion and puppetry techniques). The film veers into dark territory as the trio uncovers an Egyptian death cult, practicing human sacrifice shenanigans in a hidden underground pyramid. The latter scene is uncannily like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (also released in 1984). It was a common criticism at the time – though the script was written before Temple of Doom was released. “It was a mistake on our behalf, because we hadn’t seen [Temple of Doom] before it opened,” wrote Levinson. Presumably, though, executive producer Steven Spielberg had seen Temple of Doom, considering he, erm, directed it. In the end, Sherlock’s fencing tutor, Professor Rathe (Anthony Higgins) – who teaches Sherlock the invaluable lesson of “never replace discipline with emotions” – is not what he seems to be, which leads to a rousing sword fight on a frozen Thames.  The conclusion of the film is unexpectedly bleak: Sherlock’s first love takes a bullet for him. But faithful to the canon or not, Young Sherlock Holmes is a rollicking adventure.  “As is the case with many fandoms, a good number of Holmes purists eschew any form of pastiche,” says Gus Holwerda. “I typically count myself among such curmudgeons. But this film is an exception – for me, at least.” Watched now, it feels ahead of the curve as a piece of blockbuster cinema: a superhero origin story designed to jump-start a franchise (we find out background details such as how Holmes got the deerstalker, pipe, and his “elementary” catchphrase).  With a budget of $18 million, it cost just marginally less than Raiders of the Lost Ark. “The production design was amazing,” says Rowe. “The scale of it was there to behold when you walked onto the set. You could see they were ambitious for it, and were throwing money at it. There was a real buzz around the studio. Labyrinth was being made next door!” With its fantastical mystery and boarding school setting – combined with Watson as the bespectacled new boy – it’s now most obviously like Harry Potter. Indeed, Chris Columbus would direct the first two Harry Potter movies. “Little did I know it would turn out to be a primer for the Potter films,” Columbus told The Telegraph in 2013. Young Sherlock Holmes was also a landmark moment for effects, thanks to the wizards from SFX pioneers at Industrial Light & Magic. It was the first live action film to feature a fully computer generated 3D character – a sword-wielding knight who leaps out of a stained glass window and terrifies a poor vicar to death. The “stained glass man” was created by future Toy Story director John Lasseter and visual effects supervisor Dennis Muren. It took them six months to make 31 seconds of footage. The computer that made it was dubbed “the Pixar machine”. The film was ultimately nominated for the Best Visual Effects Academy Award, but cruelly lost out to geriatric glow-fest Cocoon. For another sequence – one that would be easily CGI’d these days – Nicholas Rowe and Alan Cox found themselves strapped into a Chitty Chitty Bang Bang-style flying machine (a make-believe anachronism that would rile the Holmes traditionalists) high above the set at Elstree. “The wind was up and there was a lot of shouting going on,” says Rowe. “I have a decent head for heights, but at that point I remember thinking, ‘What am I doing? This whole thing is insane.’” Also ahead of its time was the inclusion of a post-credits teaser – now a standard sign-off for mega-budget franchise films. “A lot of people didn’t stay for the credits,” says Nicholas Rowe. “Serves them right. It’s a nice little scene!” The teaser reveals Holmes’ arch-nemesis Moriarty – the set up for a sequel that never happened. Rowe confirms there were indeed big plans. “We had a potential three picture contract,” he says. “They were waiting to see how the first film did…” Like Holmes inspecting a scuffed shoe, it wouldn’t be Sherlock fandom without picking apart what the film gets right and wrong in forensic detail. For Adrian Braddy from Sherlock Holmes Magazine, the biggest liberty is the early meeting of Holmes and Watson. “Even as a child, I found it deeply distracting that Holmes was friends with Watson when they were schoolboys,” he says. “The most casual observer surely knows the duo met while grown men – nearly 20 years later, in A Study in Scarlet [the first Holmes novel, published in 1887].” Also, there’s Sherlock’s canon-contradicting romance. Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock is often unimpressed by women – except Irene Adler, whom he admires for matching his intellect in the 1891 short story, A Scandal in Bohemia. As Watson said: “There was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler.” With its Holmesian affectations and bumbling version of Dr Watson – not the physical, intelligent military man of Doyle’s stories – Young Sherlock Holmes is perhaps more a tribute to the popular image of Holmes, best remembered from the classic Basil Rathbone films from 1939-1946. “A lot of the references and the stuff that’s explained in the film doesn’t come from the canon,” says Braddy. “The deerstalker, the pipe, the cloak, and the ‘Elementary, my dear Watson’. None of those elements appear in the original stories. It’s an origin story for the Rathbone films rather than the real Holmes.” There is some nice attention to Holmes canon and lore, however, such as young Sherlock’s enthusiasm for fencing (taken from a line in Doyle’s The Adventure of the Gloria Scott) and Sherlock’s violin playing (though his younger self needs some practice). As with the original stories, the adventure is narrated by Watson. Also present are a number of actors from other Sherlock adaptations, most notably Nigel Stock as young Holmes’ mentor, Professor Waxflatter. Stock played Watson in the BBC series from the Sixties, alongside both Douglas Wilmer and Peter Cushing as Sherlock. Nicholas Rowe is also a fine choice for a traditional-style Holmes. “He plays the part with the perfect mixture of arrogance, superiority, aloofness and an evolving brilliance,” says Adrian Braddy. Rowe – who hasn’t seen the film in 35 years – is more critical. “I don’t remember being blown away by my own performance,” he says. “I think there are moments where you spot a man learning on the job. It’s quirky. But I love the film.” (Rowe would briefly reprise a version of the role in 2015, in the Ian McKellen-starring Mr Holmes.) Released on December 4, 1985, Young Sherlock Holmes made a disappointing $20 million in the US. “I don’t think they quite knew how to sell it,” says Nicholas Rowe. “It was a strange mishmash. It just didn’t do well at the box office.” “I think the reason the film failed is the same reason it impressed me,” says Gus Holwerda. “It was, frankly, an adult film targeted at children. Virgin sacrifices by an Egyptian cult? Nightmarish hallucinations of terror? The heartbreaking death of the innocent, female lead? Such things were not standard fare in kid flicks of the Eighties.” Away from the classic American suburbia of Amblin’s movies from the era, there's perhaps a disconnect in its English Victorian setting – a Spielbergian film that's far from home. Nicholas Rowe recalls that Spielberg himself was a fan. “I was doing a play on Broadway and he turned up afterwards,” says Rowe. “He told me that he still had a massive soft spot for the film. It was one of his kids’ favourites.” Young Sherlock Holmes gained popularity on the small screen – through VHS and television repeats. “It felt like it was on all the time!” laughs Adrian Braddy.  That it holds up as an adventure, and remains a curious entry into Holmesian lore, is a nod to the brilliance of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. “There are the traditionalists who think the canon is sacred and shouldn’t be messed with,” says Adrian Braddy. “But that’s the great thing about these characters. You can play around a little bit and put them into other film genres – into that Indiana Jones-style of adventure.”",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/tv-guide-tv-television-tonight/,culture,"It’s not just Harry and Meghan who are embracing the media these days. Lady Pamela Hicks, daughter of Lord Mountbatten, cousin of the Duke of Edinburgh, bridesmaid, companion and lifelong friend of the Queen, has been in revelatory mode recently, too, in a podcast made by her daughter, India. Never known to let a royal-related tell-all escape its grip, ITV has picked up this one-off filmed at home in Oxfordshire, in which Lady Pamela, now 91, and India, 53, look back over an exceptionally glamorous life lived right at the top of the tree. But those looking for scandal will have to look elsewhere. Unlike Harry and Meghan, there’s no word of criticism of the royals or any little idiosyncrasies they might have. Quite the opposite. “She’s an amazing person,” Lady Pamela says of the Queen. “There’s such inner strength there and she’s remained like that throughout her life.” Inevitably odd scraps leak out, relating to the Princess Royal’s hand-me-downs or the Queen’s celebrated thrift, but otherwise this is an unadulterated love letter to the Queen from one of her closest friends. While the Palace might prefer this approach, you do miss Oprah’s pizzazz.  We all have stories connected to particular pieces of clothing, items that instantly summon up the past. This new eight-parter based on a bestselling book by Emily Spivack opens a multitude of wardrobe doors and bottom drawers to see how deeply clothes are bound up with identity, creativity and memory. The show featuring business start-ups pitching for investment from a panel of entrepreneurial titans gets its 18th series off to a feelgood start with an unusually high number of successes. Not least the (traditionally triumphant) closing pitch, in which a couple with strong links to the NHS negotiate one of the most successful “equity climbdowns” in Dragons’ Den history.   Another round of heart-melting canine adoption stories as more rescue dogs are matched with their new forever families, including a pug inclined to fainting fits, a lurcher meant to mend a broken heart, and a lively Jack Russell with enough energy to follow his adventurous new owners anywhere – even on wheels. Should you not be content with your own, or even the UK’s, experience of Covid-19, this absorbing new documentary series tells the story of the pandemic from a global perspective through the experiences – and very widely varying attitudes – of people from all around the world, beginning in Wuhan. Events of the recent past make for grim but compelling viewing. If lockdown’s left you missing your April Fools japes, there’s plenty of pranking in tonight’s helping of comical challenges. Among the highlights are Lee Mack attempting a hammer throw and Sarah Kendall endeavouring to make sitting down more memorable. Greg Davies and Alex Horne present. Two decades since their hit sitcom Home Improvement came to an end, Tim Allen (known to millions as the voice of Buzz Lightyear) and Richard Karn are reunited for this small scale but entertaining challenge in which competitors test their DIY skills by trying to build or repair anything demanded of them by the hosts, from a do-it-yourself jacuzzi to a barbecue that doubles as a bicycle. It’s larky, Boy’s Own fun.  ★★★☆☆ Kevin Macdonald’s film (nominated for five Baftas) is a legal thriller of sorts, but one with a timeline that sets about defeating suspense: a 14-year incarceration without trial. It’s based on Mohamedou Ould Salahi’s 2015 memoir Guantánamo Diary, but retold without much friction. What lifts it to a major degree is Tahar Rahim’s performance as Salahi and Jodie Foster as his formidable defence attorney Nancy Hollander (a recent Golden Globe win). ★★★★★ Carol Reed confirmed his position as one of Britain’s greatest directors with this film noir, which oozes atmosphere and crackles with suspense. American writer Holly Martin (Joseph Cotten) is offered a new job in Vienna by his friend Harry (Orson Welles). But upon his arrival, Holly is told that Harry is dead. Refusing to accept this, he begins his own investigation. Graham Greene adapted his own novella for the screenplay. ★★★★★ This darkly brilliant farce by satirist Chris Morris, which finds the funny side of terrorism, was met with controversy on its release, and shows no signs of losing its bite. It charts the journey of five hapless British would-be jihadists, including family man Omar (Riz Ahmed), as they plan a mass suicide attack. What ensues is a comedy of errors, as they all are distracted on their road to paradise. Rubber dinghy rapids, anyone?  For many of us, what we look forward to most once the pandemic is over is the opportunity to travel again. Following on from its wanderlust-inducing series on great railway journeys, Channel 5 provides inspiration aplenty in this new six-part series, narrated by perennial favourite Bill Nighy, giving us a taste of some of the finest inland waterways on the planet. Among the rivers are the Danube, Mississippi and our very own River Spey in Scotland. But we begin with a trip down one of North America’s mightiest waterways, the Niagara River which runs along the border between Ontario in Canada and New York state in the US, before plunging headlong into the gorge beneath the world-famous Niagara Falls. Connecting two of the Great Lakes (Ontario and Erie), it is a short but tremendously powerful river, which over the millennia has carved out some stunning riverside landscapes. The journey begins with a short hop on a US Coast Guard launch out of Buffalo, upriver through the Chippawa Channel towards the Falls, then onwards through dizzying gorges, whirlpools and rapids before finishing with a tour of Canada’s breathtaking wine country. You’ll be longing to book plane tickets.  A unique recital of Easter sacred music featuring each of the Tenebrae vocal ensemble’s 20 singers filmed and recorded separately in isolation, under the direction of Nigel Short. Among the highlights in a selection of works by JS Bach, Lobo, Purcell, Parry and Allegri. In a chock-full Easter special Kate Quilton gets to grips with chocolate’s basic ingredient at a cocoa plantation in Ghana, and Matt Tebbutt visits a confectionery factory to uncover the mysteries of mint fondant and the secret of what makes white chocolate white. One of the most intelligently joy-giving TV series to come out of the pandemic draws its second run to a close, and we can only hope for more in the coming year. Painting up a storm for Grayson and Philippa Perry tonight are illusionist Derren Brown and Liverpudlian artist Chila Kumari Singh Burman, plus more viewers’ submissions are chosen for the exhibition. The whole run of this series has been a vibrant delight for seasoned paint-splashers and newbies alike.  Lots of ideas here for those keen to get on with gardening again now that the chill of winter is gone. At Longmeadow, Monty Don has advice on mulching and planting out sweet peas for summer colour, Carol Klein revels in the floral displays at RHS Rosemoor and there’s a look at how far daffodil enthusiasts will go to produce the perfect bloom. The second episode in this enlightening series recalls the first major setback of Churchill’s political career when, in 1915, his ill-conceived plan to shorten the First World War via a major offensive on the heavily defended Gallipoli Peninsula resulted in shocking casualties, defeat and his sacking as First Lord of the Admiralty. This nostalgic music series reaches 1984 and the days of Tina Turner’s What’s Love Got to Do with It (did you know it started off as a Bucks Fizz song?), Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s Relax, and the hits of Wham!  ★★★★☆☆ This refreshingly serious biblical epic takes on the modest task of dramatising the life of Jesus, from birth and ministry to crucifixion and resurrection. Jeffrey Hunter plays the son of God, Siobhán McKenna is his mother and Rip Torn plays Judas. It begins with the Roman invasion of Judea by Pompey in 65BC and the appointment of King Herod; the rest, as they say, is history. Nicholas Ray (Rebel Without a Cause) directs with stately authority.  ★★★★★ It’s hard to overestimate the significance of Robert Wise’s all-singing, all-dancing tale of Nazis, nuns and scenic mountainscapes – it’s one of the most iconic film musicals of all time. Julie Andrews is a nun-turned-governess for the von Trapp family, and their grumpy patriarch (Christopher Plummer). Gradually, she wins his heart – and the children’s love – through the power of song. Plummer, famously, hated his role.   ★★★★★    Wash Westmoreland’s intimate historical biopic sees Keira Knightley play Colette, a woman who marries a rakish “literary entrepreneur”, Willy (Dominic West). When he publishes one of her stories under his name to instant success, it lights a wildfire story of literary and sexual emancipation. The biographical details are bruisingly observed, and Knightley shoots daggers from behind her cut-glass cheekbones. Sarah Hughes ( ), Gerard O’Donovan ( ), Vicki Power ( ) and Gabriel Tate ( ) ",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/would-not-enjoyable-humanity-see-features-daft-punk-put-robot/,culture,"In the final scene of Daft Punk’s 2006 arthouse movie Electroma, a robot refracts sunlight through a broken glass and sets itself ablaze. It walks burning into the night and the credits roll.  Daft Punk revisited Electroma this week as the French electro duo released a video announcing their split after 28 years. Two robots – representing band members Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo – wander in the desert. Eventually they pause. One manipulates a device in their companion’s back. A countdown begins to bleep. The robot steps away and self-destructs. Music swirls in. It’s Touch, a melancholic mid-tempo workout from their 2013 album Random Access Memories.  It would require a heart of metal not to experience a twinge watching Daft Punk bow out. Yet it feels telling that the sequence with which they chose to exit is from earlier in the film, before the second robot goes up on smoke. Apparently a robot setting itself on fire is not a metaphor with which Daft Punk wished to engage as they exited the stage. They could give up on being pop stars. But they could not entirely walk away from being artificial people. At the end of the farewell clip, after all, one robot endures.  Pop stars hiding their identity behind a persona is nothing new. David Bowie did it with . And by the early Eighties Kraftwerk – Daft Punk’s teutonic precursors – had carried their “Man Machine” concept to the logical next step by behaving in a robot-like fashion in public (and, so the rumours went, in private too). More recently, groups such as London music collective Sault have arrived cloaked in mystery. Who are they, really? Nobody knows.  Daft Punk, though, took the conceit to extremes in that they appeared as invested in concealing their identity as they did in the idea of pop stars conjuring with alternative personas. Having first donned robot masks in the run-up to the 2001 album, Discovery, they seemed not so much fascinated with the idea of playing robot as in keeping their real appearances under wraps. This in part felt like a misjudgement regarding their degree of fame. Yes, hits such as Da Funk and Around The World had catapulted Daft Punk into the charts. But this was Chemical Brothers/Crystal Method level of celebrity – not Britney Spears besieged at the hair dressers. Even if the whole world knew what they looked like it’s quite possible they could have stomped around Paris or their adopted home of Los Angeles uninterrupted. On the scale of famous people you are likely to bump into in Hollywood, a French house duo was way down there.  Still, it hadn’t taken Bangalter and de Homem-Christo long to work out they weren’t keen on having their images plastered everywhere. When their 1997 debut, Homework, became a smash they took evasive action. They would wear bin-bags over their heads and plastic masks that blurred their features. Or else turn their backs on interviewers. Posing for the front of Mixmag that year they sported devil masks.  Nobody cared enough to be caught up in the drama of what they did or didn’t really look like. In part because their music was so sublime it eclipsed the two very humdrum men behind it. But also because of dance music’s culture of anonymity. The duos making up Orbital, Chemical Brothers and Leftfield all looked interchangeably like your older brother or possibly your dad. Few fans were especially invested in these musicians as celebrities in the first place. The whole point of techno is that it was extraordinary music created by ordinary people.  Daft Punk’s robot masks came later, debuting in a 2001 Face magazine photoshoot in Los Angeles. Initially the new look was received as an ironic commentary – in one memorable shot the two robots larked with members of a nudist colony.  “They wanted to portray a day in the life of Daft Punk,"" Luis Sanchis, the photographer behind the shoot told Creativeboom recently. “I came up with some of the scenarios, like the one with the people naked. That shot was actually taken in the Los Angeles house they were staying in at the time. We hired people from a real nudist colony, and as I was preparing the lights they came in – and all of a sudden, they were naked!” The masks were more than props. Working with Hollywood special effects designers and inspired by the robot Gort from The Day The Earth Stood Still, Daft Punk spent a fortune on the helmets and appeared to have poured as much creative energy into them as into their music. Collaborators were required to sign non-disclosure agreements. This was to prevent fans getting their hands on the mask blueprints. When copycats helmets started to circulate, Daft Punk were pleased to discover the measurements were slightly off – “the proportions are really hard to get right just by looking at pictures,” said Bangalter. Initially the helmets had featured “brown wigs”. At the last minute, on the way to that fateful nudist colony shoot, the duo had yanked out the hair extensions. Later versions would come with air-conditioning and sophisticated communications systems. Another set was designed specifically for media appearances: they were shinier and photographed better.  Yet in 2001 the masks were regarded as merely one component of Daft Punk’s playful new image. Indeed, the real focus was on their shapeshifting sound, which had progressed from floor-filling electronica to a sort of fantasy r’n b – influenced by house music but equally by movie scores and the Gallic-Japanese aesthetic of cartoons such as Ulysses 31, with its incredible theme by Denny Crockett and Ike Egan.  If Daft Punk were obsessed with the idea of themselves as robots, the public would be reeled in only when the duo embarked their first major world tour in 2006. Here, their anonymity was part of the fun as they bopped in their gleaming chrome robo-domes from inside an LED pyramid.  One rumour at the time was that Daft Punk had stayed at home and dispatched lackeys to do the gigs. This was a delicious conceit – and one better than Kraftwerk, who had publicly speculated that a day might come when they could put up their feet and send robots out to tour for them. Suddenly the robots made sense. Techno artists have been consistently underwhelming to watch live. In the nineties, seeing Paul Oakenfold or Carl Cox noodling on stage in their baggy t-shirts always broke the spell slightly. But electronic music played by a duo of shiny-headed robots – that was a spectacle that could sweep you away.  “We’re not performers, we’re not models – it would not be enjoyable for humanity to see our features,” de Homem-Christo told Rolling Stone in 2013, “but the robots are exciting to people.” This was one of several interviews they gave promoting Random Access Memories. That record was a conscious move away from electronica towards a warmer retro-pop. And yet most of the media coverage around the LP focused on their appearance – specifically, how ordinary they looked.  “De Homem-Christo, 39, has a wide face, delicate features, stubbled cheeks and long brown hair,” said Rolling Stone, as if describing a rare geological phenomenon rather than an electronic musician in early middle age. “Bangalter, 38, is tall, slightly rumpled, bearded, hair thinning, handsome in a cinema-studies-professor kind of way—he’s funny, good with eye contact, palpably eager to make himself understood,” added a GQ profile around the same time.  Stubbled cheeks, thinning hair – it was all so unremarkable. Indeed, had the pair not invested so thoroughly in the mystery of their appearance it’s a certainty that nobody would have cared. When last did anyone wonder what the members of The Chainsmokers looks like?  Still, with Daft Punk creating such a fuss about their “secret” identities it was inevitable someone would take a peek at their inner circuitry. And so images began to circulate of the pals in their off-duty duds. “Has Daft Punk been unmasked?” went a Vanity Fair story in 2014 – the same year they accepted their Album of the Year Grammy in white-tuxedo robot suits.  “Back in June, electronic duo the Knocks posted a photo on their Facebook page that appeared to show the French Daft Punk-ers—Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter—unmasked and playing champagne beer pong in the Sony offices, to boot,” continued the piece. “The picture was promptly removed from Facebook, the Knocks were banished from the music world entirely… and the Internet suddenly had what seemed to be a pretty good idea of what these dudes looked like.” This was by way of unveiling a new snap purporting to be of the pair at LAX. airport in Los Angeles. “One appears to be wearing a blue Texas Rangers hat,” said Vanity Fair. “The other may be wearing a trucker hat.”  These and other photos doing the rounds did not quite rock the world of pop. It turned out Daft Punk – two middle-aged French musicians – looked exactly as expected. Like two middle-aged French musicians.  Today, as fans process the duo’s break-up, they will experience a deluge of conflicting emotions. Gratitude for the wonderful music, regret Daft Punk did not have at least one more classic recording in them. But one thing nobody cares about is what these partners in escapist electronica look like in real life. If anything this overplayed mystery served as an unhelpful reminder that Daft Punk were as invested in marketing and hype as any other pop stars – that they were human after all. ",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/night-strokes-brought-rock-back-dead/,culture,"On a chilly mid-February night in 2001, rock music was reborn in a grimy pub venue in North London – or so it was often later declared. In the days following the  ’ first headline show in the capital, the swaggering young quintet from New York City were quickly heralded by the UK’s music press as alt-cultural messiahs – ineffably cool saviours of the male-dominated guitar-slinging tradition which, at that point, dated back 40 years to the birth of The Beatles, and beyond. In some ways, it really does feel like two decades ago, or more. Even pre-pandemic, the notion of ‘saving rock’ had become absurdly antiquated – indeed, a vain hope for many. After a wave of rock ‘n’ roll revivalism which followed the Strokes’ explosive ‘arrival’ that night, the musical mainstream has been dominated by rap, R&B and synth-pop for a good 15 years now, with rock bands largely consigned to cult status. Equally, the forum for making such proclamations has all but expired. With the NME, who effectively propelled the band to stardom in a matter of several weeks, these days relegated to a marginal online presence, and influential magazines like Q and Melody Maker now defunct, information and commentary are dispensed by any number of specialist websites, none of which pack the near-imperial authority of Britain’s infamous ‘inkies’ in the 1980s and 1990s. On that legendary night at the Monarch, the writing was actually already on the wall. Through the 1990s, I’d worked on an indie magazine called Select, which by the decade’s end was struggling, as the boom years of   gave way to a rather lifeless period where tastes fragmented towards UK garage and rap-rockers like Limp Bizkit, while core artists Radiohead felt the need to reinvent themselves on 2000’s Kid A as techno weirdos.  Focus-group investigations into Select’s future painted a bleak picture. Our retort was: now is like the boring time in the mid-1970s which ultimately fuelled punk rock; kids aged 16 to 24 will always need guitar music, it’s a market requirement – the cavalry will be here any minute. Our reasoning fell on deaf ears, and the publishers wound up Select in mid-December 2000. So, my own personal mood was understandably along the lines of ‘told you so’, when, barely six weeks later, I was eking a few quid as the Monarch’s house DJ for the night, and there, clear as day, the cavalry galloped onstage. The Strokes, with their crumpled suit jackets, artfully dishevelled hair and droopy-lidded insouciance, were the post-millennial shot of energy that rock fans of all ages – and both genders – were crying out for. As well as impossibly photogenic, their music plainly shunned pop’s increasingly overwrought digitization, keying into a crunchy New York lineage forever known as “the Velvets to the Voidoids”, with their louche, puppy-cheeked singer, Julian Casablancas, suavely poised as a new Lou Reed. During their handful of songs that night, I remember one noted female critic barrelling over to whisper in my ear, “They sound like Gene!”, referring to a critically unfavoured late-Britpop ensemble. Overall, though, the packed crowd of 200 scenesters were exultant, as if indeed the Second Coming was upon us.  Their big tune at that stage was Last Nite, from their doubled A-sided debut single, a solid-gold party-starter about romantic miscommunication, whose tensile riffing – loosely nicked from American Girl by Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers – came as a mighty breath of fresh air after all of Radiohead’s hand-wringing quest for hi-tech originality. The flipside, The Modern Age, told of another clueless couple who amusingly can’t work out how to act in each other’s company – unpretentious, light-hearted rock ‘n’ roll fare – while another immediate stand-out, New York City Cops, railed at their local constabulary (“they’re not too smart!”) with a smirking sense of self-awareness at the goofiness of making such a statement. By the autumn, they’d drop the song from their set, out of deference to the NYPD’s many heroes amid the horror of 9/11, but through those preceding months the Strokes essentially redefined rock ‘n’ roll as a young and carefree artform. When I met them on their return to London in June ’01, they were dizzy from the outright hysteria that greeted them at the previous night’s sell-out 1,000-capacity show at Heaven. Gathered around a rooftop pub table in Islington, they had little interest in serious analysis of their work, as they nattered in scarcely veiled terms about their respective conquests back at the hotel after the show. “Every place you go,” Casablancas informed me, between gales of giggling, “there are always cool people and less cool people. I can’t remember where we were on tour, but I was taking a shower, and Albert [Hammond Jr, guitarist] was doing phoner interviews. Afterwards he walked in saying, ‘I just don’t like these very serious – British –  !’ He’d obviously got off the phone with someone going, ‘What is your message for the children of the UK?’ He’s like, ‘I dunno, I’m just a kid myself!’” The Strokes were, indeed, a bunch of hearty youths suddenly having the time of their lives. As we talked, they fought amongst themselves over two vast boxes of free clothes. Barely into their early 20s, they distractedly detailed how they’d had their first rehearsal together in October 1998, played their first gig in September 1999, and after the Monarch show, had performed a sell-out show back home, where, said Casablancas, news of their Transatlantic success had piqued fresh interest.  “The roar was so intense,” he mistily recalled, “it almost made you fall over. But instead of falling over, it just sort of feeds you. It’s like your brain’s getting electrocuted”. The five of them were very conscious that they’d landed in the right place at the right time. They knew that their provenance from New York was a selling point here, where the “I Heart NY” T-shirt was becoming ubiquitous as a generation of young adults capitalised on the proliferation of affordable flights to explore the Big Apple. “It’s a lot like London, except it’s open much later,” reasoned their lead guitarist, Nick Valensi. “Everything is at your disposal 24 hours a day, every day of the year, whereas here, man – by midnight you can’t get anything to eat!” Nevertheless, Valensi would soon wind up dating London society starlet Amanda de Cadenet, and it was eminently detectable that day that the Strokes themselves were anything but street urchins. It would soon emerge that Casablancas, whose father founded the Elite Model agency, had met the other members at various private schools between uptown Manhattan and Rolle, Switzerland.  Consequently, their hunger for success would be called into question further into their career when activity became sporadic, and from the off they approached being in a band with a savvy bordering on world-weariness. Valensi beamingly informed me that their first album was going to be called *Is This It?, “because the hype machine is in motion, and there have already been so many magazine articles. By the time people actually get to buy the record and put it into their CD player, they’re already thinking, ‘Is this it?’” They were, however, passionate and instinctive about what they were doing. “We all listen to different stuff,” revealed Valensi, “but there’s some things we all agree on, like The Velvet Underground, Bob Marley,  …and Spinal Tap.   “I don’t like talking about the lyrics,” added Casablancas, “because it’s like explaining a dream. It might f**k up someone’s imagination of it. With good lyrics sometimes, you read them and they rhyme and they make sense and they’re pretty, but then you hear them in the song, and you’re like, ‘Wow!’ The most simple line that even a kid could understand sometimes has the deepest meaning in that context. That’s the power that music has.”  Another hurricane of laughter swept the pub table as the singer’s band mates barracked him for the absurdity of that statement, and he responded by crooning, “That’s the pow-uuurrrgh! of meeew-ziiiiiiic!” with pseudo-Bon Jovi bluster. It was very clear that the Strokes, puerile banter and all, had the magic formula of a perfect rock ‘n’ roll band for their time. Rush-released on 30 July 2001 by the newly revived UK indie label, Rough Trade, Is This It? hit Number Two over here, and enjoyed massive slow-burning success Stateside, eventually amassing global sales of over two million copies. With that, came a deluge of guitar-toting competition from the likes of the White Stripes, the Hives and countless other combos, and a world of pressure, which their dream team simply wasn’t built to withstand. In the NME, their every step was documented and scrutinized: when you’re fielding banner headlines that read, ‘Strokes Write New Song!’, every time you take a creative breath, it must become mighty hard to remain productive. They suffered something of a success freak-out, and were slow to deliver their second outing, 2003’s Room On Fire, which came across as muffled and chorus-shy. When I met them again another couple of years later around 2005’s First Impressions Of Earth, they seemed to have grown up way more than the four years it had been since our initial meeting. They also lamented how all their friends they used to party with at gigs had been priced out of Manhattan by spiralling rents, migrating to the Boroughs.  “It gets kinda lonely up here,” Hammond mused, as he gazed out from their penthouse over the famous skyline. In the interim also, of course, the internet boom had exponentially multiplied the level of scrutiny that anyone in public life had to endure, a process which obviously only intensified through to the ensuing years. Though as early-twentysomethings they were laconic and self-aware, their initial eruption onto the scene can only be reappraised now as days of relative innocence, culturally and musically, never to be repeated. Indeed, what price a game-changing group of rock messiahs in 2021? That cyclical narrative of rock rebirth followed by relative slump seemed to fade out of prevalence around the turn of the 2010’s, as the incoming younger generation discovered their own culture around social media, and accompanying air-brushed sounds characterized by funereal beats and whingeing auto-tuned rappers. Whether that screen-dominated recipe will feel relevant in what has already optimistically been daubed the Roaring Twenties, remains to be seen. In a nutshell, let’s hope not.",1

For the remainder of the First World War, he raced in Ireland. His father invested in a prize horse called Philander for his son to ride. It would turn out to be a strangely prescient name: Formby kept his lecherous private life secret from a public who made him Britain’s most adored showbusiness star of the era. Formby, who raced under his birth name George Hoy Booth, quit racing after his 45-year-father died of pulmonary tuberculosis in February 1921, shortly after collapsing during a pantomime performance in Newcastle. The teenage Formby quickly decided to follow in his late father’s vaudevillian footsteps, copying parts of his act and adding his own skits as a  entertainer who sang minstrel songs and told jokes about parrots. His huge public popularity came later, when he finally invented his own popular persona as the cheeky ukulele-playing ‘Lancashire Toreador’. Now, 60 years after Formby’s death, it is hard to overstate the level of celebrity the singer-songwriter from Wigan achieved in the mid-20th century. His most famous record, Leaning On a Lamp-post, sold 150,000 copies in just over a fortnight in 1937. The public just could not get enough of him. Formby made 20 films between 1934 and 1946, when he was British cinema’s leading attraction. The contract he signed with Columbia Pictures in 1941 made him higher-paid than Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn and  . “He used to get about £35,000 a film – by modern standards that’s about £1,500,000. He was big time,” said lifelong fan Frank Skinner. The major turning point in his early career came in September 1924, when he married “Lancashire lass” Beryl Ingham, a tenacious clog-dancing champion – a skill that had a poignancy, given that Formby hated the anti-Northern nickname ‘Cloggy’ he’d been saddled with as a youngster by Epsom stable boys. She was four years older than Formby and exerted a controlling influence from the start. Formby later described their tumultuous, largely sexless marriage, as a “living hell”. Although she guided his career expertly, astutely directing him to build his act around his ukulele performances, even though he could only play in one key and was unable to read music, she was deeply unpopular on the circuit. Actress Irene Handl called Beryl “a nasty, spiteful, twisted, conniving piece of work”, while Betty Driver, who acted with Formby as a teenager and went on to find fame as a barmaid in Coronation Street, described her as “a monstrous woman”. Beryl shaped his stage image as the good-natured, gormless northerner, always happy to play the clown. He even approved a line in a film describing him as having “a face like a horse and a row of teeth like a graveyard”, and made his buck-toothed grinning shtick his selling point. On screen, his awkwardness around young women became a Formby specialty; his moments of rising panic in any romantic scenario usually punctuated by a yelped cry of his catchphrase, “Ooooh, Mother!”. People loved his squeaky-clean image as much as his squeaky voice. Actor Timothy Spall, who recreated Formby in his 2016 film Stanley, A Man of Variety, is among those who identified a disturbing hidden quality that Formby shared with other great entertainers of his era, including Max Wall and Noël Coward. “Beneath the appearance of cosy fun and jollity,” remarked Spall, “there was something sinister about their affability.” Although Beryl kept a lid on the darker parts of the Formby story, some of the elements, including her own affairs with young actors, came to light in David Bret’s 1999 biography George Formby: A Troubled Genius, the most explicit of the five biographies of Formby. “Beryl had her young men; he had his leading ladies,” said the author in an interview. Bret’s book sparked outrage among the legions of the entertainer’s fans – who call themselves Formbyites – especially diehard members of The George Formby Society, which was founded in the aftermath of the entertainer’s death in 1961. In July 1999, in an editorial in The George Formby Newsletter, the society reacted angrily to the salacious biography, admitting it could be “very damaging” to the society’s image. “Bret’s controversial book condemns George as a womanising drug addict who had leanings toward homosexuals and sympathy towards Hitler. Beryl was classed as a drunkard, a bag and a cow who had a string of affairs,” the editorial said. To add insult to injury, the society reported that Bret had dismissed their members as a bunch “who walk round wielding Zimmer frames and ukuleles”. As well as highlighting old family skeletons – including the story that Formby’s grandmother had been a sex worker in Ashton-under-Lyne and that his father George Formby Snr was a bigamist – Bret revealed the extent of Formby’s womanising with dancers and chorus girls, describing how Beryl flew into drunken rages when she heard about Formby’s philandering. When Formby had an affair with Kay Walsh in 1937, on the set of Keep Fit, Beryl tried to have the young actress removed from the production. When director Anthony Kimmins refused, Formby’s wife went to producer Basil Dean and asked him to have Walsh made look less appealing on screen, fitted out in dowdy frocks and given an unflattering haircut. Walsh, who married director David Lean three years later, apparently fell for Formby’s “charming flirtation”. Although the public believed in the image of ‘Good old George’, his seedy reputation among the acting fraternity was well known. “He screwed like a tiger until dawn,” Bret said in 1999. “Whenever we did a film with him, it would go round the girls’ grapevine: ‘He’ll make passes at you.’ He couldn’t resist trying to make it with all his leading ladies,” said Phyllis Calvert, Formby’s co-star in the 1940 film Let George Do It. Florence Desmond, who was Formby’s leading lady in the mid-1930’s films No Limit and Keep Your Seats, Please, even branded Formby “a dirty little man” and a “dirty little Northern would-be Casanova”.   was a fan of Formby – he chose his song Auntie Maggie’s Remedy as one of his Desert Island Discs choices – and the jazz singer was told by a friend of his actress sister Andrée that it was common knowledge on the northern theatre circuit that Formby would try to seduce dance girls by saying “‘Eee, I’m crazy about you” before offering them, with a wink, the chance to “play with my ukulele”. Sarah Gregory, star of Zip Goes a Million, said Formby used inappropriate physical contact during filming. Formby’s behaviour would have attracted #MeToo publicity in the modern era, but at the time actresses could not risk exposing such a powerful star. The 21-year-old Googie Withers, 14 years younger than Formby when they made Trouble Brewing in 1939, recalled years later that Formby took advantage of a scene in which they fell into a vat of beer to touch her up. “Because we were in water, my skirt had ridden up. He had his hand on my bare thigh and he kept it there and started to kiss me… Beryl was in on it like a flash screaming ‘cut, cut!’” It seems that many of Formby’s female co-stars were obliged to be part of the weird psychodrama of the Formby marriage. Formby’s sexual harassment usually occurred as part of a game of evading the hawk eye of Beryl. Perhaps the strangest of all Formby’s adulterous liaisons was with a chanteuse who went by the stage name of Yana, an affair that began in June 1960, when Formby was top-of-the-bill in a revue at the Queen’s Theatre in Blackpool. Formby was 56 and Yana was 29 at the time. Although Yana’s name hinted at an exotic background, the singer was in fact called Pamela Guard, a former hairdresser’s assistant from Billericay in Essex. She was famous enough to merit inclusion in the 1998 Daily Telegraph Third Book of Obituaries: Entertainers, which described her as “blatantly lesbian”. Formby, it seems, was unaware of her bisexuality, even though she was also living with an American actress at the time. Their affair, which came when Beryl’s alcoholism had started spiralling out of control as she battled leukaemia, was apparently torrid. It prompted a memorably lurid exchange in Bret’s stage play Our George: The George Formby Story: A Play in 2 Acts, during a scene in which Yana is helping Formby get out of his Mr Wu Chinese costume, after one of their shows in Blackpool. “George, would you like to stick it between my t__s again?” Brett has Yana ask Formby. It’s a far cry from Formby’s innocent movie naïveté displays. Bret, who has written biographies of Joan Crawford, Maurice Chevalier and Morrissey, also angered Formby fans with other revelations. Before he became a writer, Bret worked as an NHS administrator in Yorkshire, where he gained access to Formby’s medical records. Among the information he divulged in the book was highly personal detail about the singer’s time in a psychiatric hospital in York, where he was treated for depression and “morphine addiction”. Another controversy in the book concerned the time in 1944 Formby was supposedly investigated by the Home Office’s Dance Music Policy Committee over sympathies to Hitler, a period Formby referred to as “a nightmare”. There were claims that his song Swim Little Fish supposedly mocked the effort against the German U-boats, which were at the time sinking British convoys in the Atlantic. The investigation was rumoured to have been instigated by a jealous actor. In any case, the pro-Hitler charge seems ludicrously far-fetched. Formby was held in high regard by the government and his devotion to the war effort seems clear. He worked as a dispatch rider for the Home Guard and went on numerous overseas tours to entertain British troops, always reminding them that “it’s wonderful to be British”. In addition, the dream sequence in his movie Let George Do It, in which he descends from a balloon in the middle of a Nazi rally to punch Adolf Hitler in the face, was judged in a survey from The Mass Observation Project to have been “the biggest morale-booster of the Second World War.” It’s highly likely that Formby would not have been able to explain himself adroitly in a nuanced argument about lyrics. He was deeply self-conscious about having left school at the age of seven and never having learned to read or write properly. His lack of intellect was sometimes cruelly mocked by his fellow actors. Desmond said of Formby that “the man’s as thick as two very short planks”, while actress Pat Kirkwood, described him as “a cretinous little creature”, adding that “if you tried to converse with him, you’d find there was no one at home”. Although Formby had his detractors, he also had his high-profile fans. And none more elevated than Queen Elizabeth. The Queen’s parents were both Formby fans. He sang before King George VI at the 1937 Royal Variety Performance, and the king sent him a letter saying his family had been “convulsed with laughter” at Formby’s 1938 film It’s in the Air. He was later invited to give a private show at Windsor, which was watched by the young future monarch and her sister Princess Margaret. In 2003, for his book about the Queen, Gyles Brandreth interviewed Deborah Bean, Her Majesty’s long-serving Correspondence Secretary. “During our conversation Mrs Bean revealed to me that the Queen had once told her that she loved the songs of George Formby, knew all of them, could sing them – and frequently did.” There were even reports that she once asked to be president of the George Formby Appreciation Society, although no corroboration of this exists. In 2018, at a special Royal Albert Hall concert to celebrate the Queen’s 92nd birthday, the monarch was particularly delighted when Skinner, Harry Hill and Ed Balls joined members of The George Formby Society to deliver a version of When I’m Cleaning Windows, the Peeping Tom-style song about a man who spies on women undressing. The song was once banned as “not fit to be broadcast” by BBC chairman Lord Reith, who dismissed it as “a disgusting little ditty”. A lot of Formby’s songs were innuendo-filled, including You Can't Keep a Growing Lad Down, With My Little Ukulele in My Hand and With My Little Stick of Blackpool Rock, which was also banned by the BBC for its smutty double-entendres. My Little Snapshot Album contained risqué lines for 1938:  Formby was a witty songwriter – Our Sergeant Major is a fine example of war-time satire – and he attracted other influential fans too, including comedian Peter Sellers, who could do an uncanny impression of the Lancashire singer. Sellers praised Formby as “a terrific performer” and the ukulele man’s songs have been performed by Bill Haley, Richard Thompson and Lonnie Donegan.  was also a fan – paying tribute by including Formby’s iconic line “it’s turned out nice again” in his song Free as A Bird – while fellow Beatle  was such a devotee that he bought the gold-plated banjolele ukulele that Formby used in live performances. Beryl is often the butt of a story that claimed she limited Formby to a weekly allowance of five-shillings of pocket money in their early days, but once he made it big, he spent a fortune on cars and houses. Formby bought more than a hundred luxury cars in his most successful years, including 26 Rolls-Royces with personalised number plates. Then there were the properties. In the early 1950s, Formby bought a lavish 24-room mansion at Foxrock, outside Dublin, telling a reporter who spotted him in the estate agent office that “I’m sick to death of the taxman robbing me of 90 per cent of my earnings.” Some of his fortune came from lucrative foreign tours, including an eventful one in 1946 to South Africa, when he played to black audiences, despite angry complaints from Daniël François Malan, head of the National Party and the future prime minister who was one of the chief architects of apartheid two years later. When Beryl kissed a young black girl who presented Formby with a box of chocolates, Malan sought the couple out to shout at them. “Why don’t you piss off, you horrible little man?” replied Beryl. They were ordered out of the country, never to return. By the late 1950s, life was becoming more difficult for the couple, despite the opulence of their home in Fairhaven, Lytham, which was originally called Cintra, but which Formby’s wife immediately renamed as ‘Beryldene’. Formby was closer to his dog Willie Waterbucket than he was to wife. Although Formby had been warned to take it easy after his heart attack in 1949, he was still smoking 40 Capstan Full Strength and Woodbine cigarettes a day – cheerfully calling them his “coffin nails” – and eating lots of beef-dripping toast. As Beryl’s cancer worsened she sought solace in drinking, sometimes consuming a bottle of whisky a day. She was 59 when she died on Christmas Day 1960. Beryl’s illness had allowed him free access to conduct the affair with Yana, but when that ended – and with work now intermittent – Formby turned his attention to a local woman called Pat Howson. Formby was a friend of her father Fred (who as general manager of Loxhams Car Showroom in Preston had sold him cars) and Formby sometimes took the Howson family on holiday on his boat on the Norfolk broads. Pat Howson, then 35, taught religious education and was sympathetic when Formby told her that Beryl, an atheist, “tried to turn me away from my Catholic religion”. In February 1961, they announced their engagement. “I first met her when she was nine, just a pretty little schoolgirl in ringlets,” 56-year-old Formby told The Daily Mirror. He said they reunited after his wife’s death and after a fortnight of courting he “popped the question”. Just two days before the wedding, on March 6 1961, Formby died of heart failure. The aftermath of his death was engulfed in rancour. Formby’s mother Eliza vetoed Howson’s funeral arrangements and had her son buried in Warrington instead of Preston. Although Formby left almost all his £2.2 million estate to Howson, his 82-year-old mother took the matter to court, reportedly saying her family would “fight that little floozy schoolma’am with their last breath”. The legal battle lasted nearly a decade before a compromise was reached. The money seemed cursed, however. Howson died of ovarian cancer in 1971, aged just 46. Eliza lived on until 1981, when she died at 102. The 150,000 fans who lined the 20-mile route of Formby’s funeral procession knew little of the truth about Formby’s life. They simply loved one of their own, a man who admitted that, “I’m just a clown without the make-up, the circus clown who magnifies the reactions of ordinary people to the things that happen around them.”",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/interviews/black-crowes-interview-last-trouble-makers/,culture,"Following the breakup of the Black Crowes, on the penultimate day of 2014 the group’s front man, Chris Robinson, played a concert for a thousand people at the Cervantes Masterpiece Ballroom, in Denver. Trading under the name the Chris Robinson Brotherhood, the band were on the road in a van; not just this, they were setting up their own equipment, too. They had to – the singer needed the money.  Interested parties looked on askance. In his deliciously vengeful memoir Hard To Handle: The Life and Death of the Black Crowes, the group’s erstwhile drummer Steve Gorman writes that, “Chris seems to think that singing Black Crowes songs on occasion with a pickup band is in some way meaningful, but it’s dubious to suggest those shows are about anything beyond financial desperation.” Remarkable, really. In the final 10 years of the 21st Century, the Black Crowes sold somewhere in the region of 15-million albums. Re-issued last week in expanded form, the Atlanta quintet’s debut LP, Shake Your Money Maker, from 1990, found an audience of five million people in the United States alone. A year before Nirvana gatecrashed the mainstream, the “Crowes” were the first wholly credible international rock success story of the decade.  “All that record sales money, that’s long gone,” Chris Robinson tells me. On the line from his home in Colorado, about this the 54 year old sounds not all bothered. “We weren’t taken care of in that way at all. I’m not a person who’s very savvy with his finances. My wife knows that, my kids know that, we’re all good. Sometimes just doing things for money is like the most boring and worst thing. You can just see it in a band you love sometimes. No matter where they are in their career, when they just dial it in for the money there’s a light that goes out.” The quote is instructive. Wedded to honourable notions of artistic purity – as far back as 1992, the singer was bemoaning record executives “who call music ‘product’” – with tracks such Remedy, Sometimes Salvation and My Morning Song the Georgians were once giants. With better lines of communication, and with better advice, as with Pearl Jam they might have become an enduring stadium-sized worldwide institution. Instead, dependably fractious they proved capable of cocking up  .   On rhythm guitar the group’s line-up featured Rich Robinson, the singer’s younger brother. Today reunited as a two-man band, following the second of the Black Crowes’ two breakups, in 2014, the siblings didn’t speak for six years. The fracture occurred after Chris Robinson demanded a larger share of the money. “There will be no negotiation or wriggle-room when it comes to the percentages below,” the band were told, via email. Asked about this today, in mitigation the front man says that “I felt that the only way to make [the band] stop would be to ask for the one thing that I knew no one would go for”.  “As a family, the Robinsons aren’t good communicators anyway,” Rich Robinson tells me. “No one ever wanted to address [something that] had just happened. So it was easier for us to pretend that it didn’t happen and just keeping moving on. But ultimately it comes down to communication and transparency… [otherwise] you don’t talk for months and you’re onstage resenting the sh*t out of someone who’s your partner. How can you be in a band like that? How does that even work? The answer is you can’t, and it doesn’t, ultimately.” The Robinsons were merely the latest in a long-line of quarrelsome rock siblings. On the road with  , in 1996, the two groups titled their co-headline campaign The Tour Of Brotherly Love. Mark Lanegan, the singer with opening band Screaming Trees, arranged to have a fistfight with Liam Gallagher after the final date, in Miami (the concert was cancelled). Asked today, Rich Robinson recalls the rambunctious caravan as being “one of the most fun tours that I can remember”. “The two groups had a kinship because we’re two stubborn-ass brothers from Atlanta who would tell people to f*** off, and they were two stubborn-ass brothers from Manchester who would also tell people to f*** off,” he says. “So there was a mutual respect there.” As different as chalk and spaceships, in the days when he was spending $100,000 per annum on cannabis Chris Robinson married movie star Kate Hudson. Cocaine and (on occasion) heroin was also stirred into the mix. Three years his junior, crippled by anxiety and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Rich Robinson remained abstinent. “Drugs tapped into every fear and anxiety that I ever had, so I stayed away from them,” he says.  “I had some moments with drugs, but I knew where I was,” Chris Robinson says. “I knew what I was doing. There were a few times in the late Nineties, or a certain period in the Nineties, where depression just got a hold of me, but… for the most part I had an amazing time. It is what it is, I’m not ashamed. Back then I didn’t have children; I didn’t have responsibilities to anyone else. It’s as if I was a completely different being back then.” In 1990, the Black Crowes came out of nowhere. Signed by producer George Drakoulias to Rick Rubin’s Def American label (now American Recordings), in Atlanta the group’s name would draw crowds of fewer than a hundred people. In lieu of a local following, or anything like a buzz, instead they had a berth on a fast-emerging maverick imprint that would soon be recognised as one of the most fearless in North America. Green they may have been, but suddenly the Crowes shared a roster with Slayer, the Geto Boys, Danzig and the Jesus and Mary Chain.  Released on February 13 1990, to the casual ear Shake Your Money Maker was simply a persuasive mélange of classic Seventies American rock and The Faces without the boorishness. But within the grooves there was something deeper, and more sinuous. Forget Rod the Mod, the Black Crowes learned their most important lessons at the feet of punk bands such as The Replacements and X. Seeing REM play Aerosmith’s Toys In The Attic at the Fox Theater, in Atlanta, Rich Robinson thought, “I want .”  It was more than lip service, too. After Chris Robinson (not for the first time) criticised ZZ Top’s decision to allow the Miller Brewing Company to sponsor their live campaign, following a hometown show at the Omni the Georgians were bounced from the opening slot on tour. Speaking to MTV, Robinson explained that “I can see them being defensive about corporate sponsorship. But we’re not sponsored by anyone. We’re the Black Crowes.” There was plenty more where that came from. Spoiling for a scrap, when Tower Records offered to hoist a Black Crowes promotional flag on the roof of their iconic store, on Sunset Boulevard, the band insisted it fly at half mast. “It’s a symbolic gesture that says to all the people in the capital of the music industry that we’re in mourning for the death of rock’n’roll,” Chris Robinson told the writer Max Bell, in 1991. “Think about that instead of what’s in the charts and all the demographic bullsh*t.” Unencumbered by anhedonia, other members of the band were not quite so enamored of their singer’s tireless crusade to start a fight in every empty room in the world. With a clearly delineated hierarchy – the Robinsons wrote all the songs – Gorman, bassist Johnny Colt and lead guitarist Marc Ford, who joined in 1991, tended to regard their singer’s expectorations with a mixture of weariness and irritation. Gaining a taste for the trappings of fame, some people just wanted to rock.  “The second we got some success there were certain people who wanted to play it safe,” says Chris Robinson, unrepentant to the last. “They’d say, ‘Oh we’ve got a big tour, man, and we’ve got mortgages to pay’. Well I’m not here to pay your f****** mortgage, man. I’m here to sop up all these experiences like a big piece of French bread with some nice gravy. Those guys knew that when they met me. Especially back then, when the world was wild and rock’n’roll was a thing, you know.” If the Black Crowes appeared temperamentally unsuited to fame, who wouldn’t be? In the year before alternative music turned the mainstream upside down, Chris Robinson’s barbed mouth was seen by many as evidence of chippiness, or ingratitude. In 2021 the singer still says things like “you don’t want to get a whiff of the corporate f****** assholes of the music industry”; 30 years earlier, quintuple platinum he was simply another newbie millionaire left alone to deal with the consequences of life-changing success.  “It was a shock,” is how Rich Robinson describes the music industry’s most glaring deficiency. “None of us were ever taught how to handle success. There was no manual. We were just left on our own to deal with things. And that comes into play when we’re talking about drama and how we handled ourselves. We did the best we could, but it was definitely shocking. This thing fell in our laps.” On record, the Black Crowes were a world-class group for barely two years. Released in 1992, then and now the band’s second album, The Southern Harmony And Musical Companion, is rightly regarded as a capstone of American rock music. Recorded in only nine days, the organic masterpiece found its authors in altitudinous form. As well as this, Def American’s rookie error in failing to exercise the option for a second record before the deadline for doing so elapsed meant that the group were able to renegotiate their royalty rate to a level befitting their superstar status. Long story short, it went to their heads. Costing $600,000, the band’s third album, Amorica, itself no dud – and it ought not to have been, it was recorded twice – tiptoed uneasily into a domestic scene dominated by Green Day and The Offspring. By now it was like Lynyrd Skynyrd trying to look hip at a party thrown by the Buzzcocks. Having survived the grunge revolution, by 1994 the Black Crowes were no longer hungry insurrectionists. Crabby as ever, instead they looked old before their time.    Inevitably, they toured themselves into the ground. Often obdurate, usually intense, occasionally boring, come the latter part of the Nineties the Crowes were as powerful and precise a musical unit as any on the circuit. But for all their nuance and finesse, Steve Gorman’s observation that “[Oasis] struck me as a ‘great songs, good band’ kind of a band, whereas I thought that [we] were often a ‘great band, good songs’ kind of a band” is piercingly true.  “The history of rock music shows quite clearly that the former succeeds far more than the latter,” he writes.   “I think our main mistakes were that we didn’t take some time to get off the treadmill,” says Chris Robinson. “But it’s kind of like being a fighter, they want you to fight as much as you can when you’re in your prime because you get the biggest purse. I felt at the time that I was somewhat savvy enough to realise the nuances of that. It doesn’t matter how good the music is, or how deep or soulful your expression is, they just want you to make them some money.”  By the 21st Century it was all a mess. Scrapping like tomcats, the Black Crowes fell out over royalties, over the cost of tour buses, and about how best to deal with members misusing hard drugs. A reliable theatre draw – even at their most popular, the group declined to move into arenas – by now the Georgians were playing corporate events for a hundred grand a pop. Nice work if you can get it, I suppose, but a distant cry from the days of railing against a beer company sponsoring a tour on which they were merely special guests.   For his part Steve Gorman recalls that “there were fistfights on the [tour] bus. There were insults lobbed at wives. There were threats given and received with staggering regularity. It never ended, so it never began anew. It was constant. And every night, through all of that [there] were [other] things that happened that Chris and Rich couldn’t be bothered to notice.” To no one’s surprise, neither Robinson brother will admit to having read their drummer’s 346-page letter of revenge. “I get that the last bit of money he can get is to make me and Rich look bad,” says the singer, adding “I’m just not interested in his point of view.” On the line from Tennessee, the younger sibling says something that to me sounds valid. “Steve Gorman told me one time that the thing that scared everyone the most was when me and Chris got along,” he says. “And I thought, ‘What a really f***** up way to look at things. All of our greatest records and successes with the band happened when Chris and I were on the same page. And when that’s the case, whether or not that’s counter to people’s little power grabs, a rising tide floats all boats.” Which is why, even now, it is surely unwise to write off the Black Crowes. In recent publicity photographs, the Robinson brothers look like the kind of bearded and suited Southern gentlemen who have never once raised their voices in anger. The fact that their group has burned through fifteen members suggests otherwise. But with an American tour having fallen prey to the virus, instead the pair have written a batch of songs that Rich Robinson describes as “our best in decades”. If this is true, and should their authors be able to cleave together, for the first time in an age the results might just be remarkable.  “There’s nothing wrong with success and there’s nothing wrong with ambition,” Chris Robinson tells me. “I’m lucky to be in one of the last generations of people who caused trouble. It might look destructive in my career, but I didn’t care what the record company had to say. I still don’t care. Those guys don’t live like me, they don’t look like me, and they don’t smell like me. It’s part of that idea of the artist as the outsider. It’s about being able to find beauty and art in madness.  ",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/concerts/maroon-5s-live-streamed-gig-offers-authenticity-instagram-filter/,culture,"The problem with performing a live-streamed pop concert towards the end (let’s hope) of a global lockdown is that all the best online tricks have been used. Over the last year, we’ve seen Gorillaz perform with   of holograms and avatars, and Dua Lipa stun fans with   in a recreated Studio 54 nightclub. All this set the bar high for what Maroon 5 promised would be a “visually spectacular journey” through their music. It was therefore perhaps inevitable that the Los Angeles pop band came up short. The set of this online gig was like something from an MTV Unplugged concert in the 1990s. While its Doric columns, foliage and billowing drapes gave it the faint air of Brixton Academy (remember that venue?), a vintage car and a stack of flickering television sets recalled U2’s ground-breaking Zoo TV tour of 1992. There were also – oddly – what looked like statues of poodles dotted around, though these were visual hints rather than a concept (unless Brixton Petting Zoo was the aim). For me, the set lacked oomph and innovation, but Maroon 5 have never been a band to scare the horses. And this is partly why they’re so popular. Since their breakthrough album, 2002’s Songs About Jane, they’ve won three Grammys, sold 75 million albums and played the Super Bowl half-time show. Singer Adam Levine – every inch the lithe and tattooed frontman – is a star in his own right, having appeared as a judge on The Voice in America for 16 series. They’re also something of a rarity for an early 2000s band, in that they’ve endured into the digital age: their new songs garner billions of Spotify streams. It’s astonishing to think that they broke through in the same year as The Libertines. That band’s Pete Doherty was pictured last week settling down into comfortable middle-aged obscurity in France. Comparing him to Levine, it’s clear who’s had the better campaign.  Musically, Maroon 5 take in rock, pop, RnB and hip hop. They’re undeniably slick at what they do: their music is catchy and inoffensive. Between the songs there were some anodyne “fan Q&As” with Levine and golden-haired guitarist James Valentine, who is visually the mid-point between Harvest-era Neil Young and Prince Harry. (The band has been reduced from seven-piece to six-, after bassist Mickey Madden took a “leave of absence” last summer, following his arrest for alleged domestic violence.) Rapper Megan Thee Stallion appeared on a screen for their new single Beautiful Mistakes, while Cardi B popped up on the TVs during Girls Like You. Crossover hits such as these also explain the band’s broad appeal. But what Maroon 5 achieve in breadth, they lack in depth. Perhaps it’s me, but when I was growing up in the 1980s and 1990s, bands stayed in their lane. Their authenticity relied on them sticking to one genre, and woe betide any that strayed. If a folk band deployed a dance beat or a rocker cut his hair, they were committing crimes against music. Maroon 5 are the opposite of that. Last night’s show embraced the entire canon. Sugar, from 2014, brought to mind mid-paced Prince, all falsetto and slick pop-funk, while This Love’s funky organ and squelchy bass could have been an outtake from Stevie Wonder’s mid-1970s purple patch. Sunday Morning had a breezy Bill Withers vibe, while Animals ended with an eye-popping thrash-metal coda that was pure Metallica – although Levine’s badass “rawk” credentials were somewhat diluted by the vast Hello Kitty face on his pink Fender guitar. In this sense, I suppose it was a musical journey. But the band’s genre-hopping approach makes them the sonic equivalent of the Instagram filter function. Each of Maroon 5’s tracks has its own distinctive and authentic-seeming wash – but they leave you wondering what the band underneath really looks like.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/non-fiction/sharon-stone-could-pick-pocket-bit-practice/,culture,"Perhaps you only think of   as the dazzling beauty who uncrossed her legs so unforgettably in Basic Instinct? Think again. Her memoir begins with a horrifying account of the stroke she suffered in September 2001 that she believes divided her life in two. She banged her head falling over at home and spent several days with a blinding headache before calling a doctor. She was whisked off to a local hospital and then to a top neurological one in San Francisco where she was told she had a bleed to the brain. She was actually being wheeled into the operating theatre when she heaved herself up from the gurney and shouted at the neurosurgeon: “You’re fired!” His crime was to have claimed she signed consent forms when she knows she didn’t, and also to have given an interview to People about her condition. She insisted on waiting another day for a different neurosurgeon to arrive even though she knew she could die any moment. At this stage, a few pages into the book and before you’ve got to know Stone’s combative character, you think possibly she’s mad, but by the end, you’ll want to cheer. , a brawler, from “kitchen-sink Irish” hillbilly stock. Kitchen sink, she explains, means “if you have four kids and one bathroom, you piss in the sink”. She grew up on a hardscrabble farm in Pennsylvania, in Amish country, the third of four children trained to work hard – her tasks included painting the barn, mowing the lawn and pouring concrete. Her parents were always too busy to pay much attention to her. There were dodgy relatives around, like Uncle Gene, who was good fun until she found him holding a gun to his head and threatening to kill himself for what seemed like hours. “This killing-oneself business is a very time-consuming situation,” she sighs, “and, I have found, somewhat boring.” But she also had her beautiful Aunt Vonne and even more beautiful grandmother Lela, who wore Schiaparelli suits and Guerlain perfume, and would take her to stay with them where she felt “I was someone’s favourite. I mattered somewhere.” Aunt Vonne taught her about books and paintings; grandmother Lela taught her to steal – “Oh I could put the entire dinner service in your bag while talking to you. Yes, I probably could pick a pocket with a bit of practice. Old light fingers.” Stone was obviously bright but a misfit at school. “I was in trouble all the time for doing that wholly unfeminine thing of THINKING.” Rather than go to university, she preferred waitressing at the local McDonald’s and winning county beauty pageants. Her elder brother Mike worked on an air force base unloading headless corpses from Vietnam – “The Viet Cong took heads, we took ears, in case you didn’t know about the trophy side of war.” But when he started dealing cocaine “it got really scary really fast”, and he was sent to prison for l0 years. Sharon’s mother, Dot, thought she should get away and decided she should be a model. She had seen an interview with Eileen Ford on television, so she took Sharon to New York and turned up at Eileen Ford’s agency. Mrs Ford signed Sharon on sight. She was too short and curvaceous for catwalk modelling but she still made $5,000 a day doing all the “difficult” jobs – bathing suits in winter and fur coats in summer – whizzing round New York on roller skates. Then she went to an extras’ casting call for a   and Allen spotted her in the queue, told her she was a natural, and gave her a part in Stardust Memories (1980). Other parts followed and she went to Cannes for Total Recall with Arnold Schwarzenegger. But she felt she was “ageing out of the business” by the time she made her l8th film, Basic Instinct, which made her a star. Critics panned the film and laughed when she was nominated for a Golden Globe, but audiences loved it. She made dozens of films, mainly forgotten, though she was Oscar-nominated for her part in Casino, directed by Martin Scorsese. As an actor she had a reputation for being difficult – she says it was often because she refused to sleep with the director or her co-star. “Sex, not just sexuality on-screen, has long been expected in my business.” But also she was proud to be “a studio girl” and would happily snitch on other actors or crew if she felt they were drugging or drinking and not doing their jobs. “I was on the side of the studio – not a popular position to be in… It would be fair to say I f----- myself.” By the late 1990s her career was already winding down and she moved from Los Angeles to Northern California. She was married and wanted to have children but after a series of miscarriages she adopted a baby, Roan. He was only l8 months old when she had her stroke. The surgery took seven hours and left her with a distorted face and a dragging leg. She lost short-term memory and couldn’t read for two years. “Yes, I lost many things: my career, my savings, my residential custody of my son, my so-called marriage, my place in line in regaining my career, my former ability to simply look at any page of dialogue for two minutes and have instant recall, and a kind of luminous beauty that I hadn’t even realised that I’d had.” She fought for custody of her son for l3 years, unsuccessfully, but she adopted two more sons, Laird and Quinn, as a single mother. Dior gave her a beauty contract that kept her going financially for several years, until she blew it by making disobliging remarks about China, which jeopardised Dior’s Chinese market. She says now, at 63, she is something of a recluse. She can walk normally and has regained “most” of her memory but the right side of her head still hurts. She takes acting roles when offered but is not hungry for it as she used to be. She spends most of her time doing charitable work, raising money for Aids or handing out sleeping bags to homeless people, or taking a friend to Native American full-moon hoop ceremonies to cure her cancer. Unfortunately this is much less fun to read about than her rumbustious childhood or her Hollywood career. But there are enough great yarns and sardonic jokes in the rest of the book to make up for the woo-woo “inspirational” babble at the end.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/new-long-leg-dry-cleaning-lead-renaissance-british-monologue/,culture,"“I just want to put something positive in the world but it’s hard because I’m so full of poisonous rage,” drawls Florence Shaw in tones of exquisite boredom. While her band, Dry Cleaning, stir up a furious squall of post-punk energy on their debut album New Long Leg, their frontwoman, a former art-school lecturer, maintains an indifference to melody or emotion unmatched since Grace Jones’s 1980s pomp. Shaw, however, has little of Jones’s exotic imperiousness. She offers spoken-word surrealist recitations crammed with mundane domestic detail. “Just an emo dead stuff collector / Things come to the brain,” she intones, with less expressiveness than a newsreader giving the Third Division football scores. “It’s useless to live / I’ve been thinking about eating that hot dog for hours.” Pre-pandemic, a wave of punky guitar bands with spoken-word vocalists arose, including Idles, Shame, Sports Team,   and The Murder Clinic. They’ve been followed this past 12 months by a second wave, who haven’t even had live venues in which to declaim their monologue rock. That might explain the less declamatory and more poetically nuanced developments in this deadpan style, as exhibited by such recent contenders as Black Country, New Road (whose brilliant debut came out in February) and now the Brighton quartet Dry Cleaning. New Long Leg is an album as jagged as a shard of glass, counterpointing brittle yet glisteningly lovely rock instrumentals with a lyrical voice that might be likened to ennui frozen and served on a stick. Shaw’s non-sequiturs are baffling enough to suggest that they’ve been assembled from overheard conversations and random social-media texts via some  -style cut-up machine. She pitches dizzyingly between banality and psychosis. As she declares on Scratchcard Lanyard: “I think of myself as a hardy banana with that waxy surface and the small delicate flowers / A woman in aviators firing a bazooka… and thanks very much for the Twix.” Yet there’s both art and humour in her abstractions, a sense of aesthetic intent that ensures that her imagery clusters around core themes – feminism, alienation, depression and paranoia softened by the joys of small comforts – and constantly threatens moments of revelation. The real plaudits should go to Shaw’s brightly inventive guitarist and fellow art-school lecturer Tom Dowse, and his taut, minimalist rhythm section of bassist Lewis Maynard and drummer Nick Buxton, all thirty-something veterans of amateur metal bands. Under the production of PJ Harvey collaborator John Parish, they concoct intense and exciting instrumentals, expanding post-punk influences (Gang of Four, Magazine, Joy Division) to encompass the melodic indie rock of The Smiths and The Strokes and the noisy abandon of Sonic Youth. Any vocalist might thrill to engage with such sleek backing tracks, yet Shaw’s cool delivery and off-kilter lyricism occupies unusual spaces in the band’s arrangements, pushing the whole project into edgily discombobulating territory. And for a brief moment, on More Big Birds, Shaw wordlessly hums “da da da” with enough melodiousness to suggest she might be able to hold a tune – if only she could be bothered. Whatever next? Singing?",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/tumultuous-final-years-janis-joplin-brother-sister/,culture,"On August 14 1970,   went home. Thomas Jefferson High School in Port Arthur, Texas, was holding a 10-year reunion. Joplin rocked up in hippie flares, a scoop-necked T-shirt, a feather boa that she wore as a hat, and her trademark round, colour-tinted sunglasses. At the time, the 27-year-old singer and songwriter was one of the biggest counter-cultural forces in America. An incendiary performer on- and off-stage, she was a hippie style icon and feminist trailblazer who’d made her name on the San Francisco scene as frontwoman with Big Brother and the Holding Company. Her incredible blues range saw her credited as having “The Voice of a Lady Leadbelly”, as the New York Free Press headlined a February 1968 profile. The previous summer Joplin had been one of the star performers at Woodstock, managing to cut through the stoned fug and 2am start time with an earth-shaking performance. As The Who’s Pete Townsend wrote in his memoir, Who I Am: “She had been amazing at Monterey, but tonight she wasn t at her best, due, probably, to the long delay, and probably, too, to the amount of booze and heroin she d consumed while she waited. But even Janis on an off-night was incredible.” Indeed. As The Washington Post wrote in April 1968 of her stage persona: “She screams, she stomps, she jumps, she quivers, she flails her arms, she flings her great wild mane like an unbroken pony.” Later that summer of 1970, Joplin would begin work on her second solo album, Pearl, which would feature some of her best-known songs, including her cover of 1963 R&B track Cry Baby and her own (co-written) Mercedes Benz. But before that, there was that detour back to Port Arthur, the small, conservative Texan community in which, as a beatnik-channelling teen rebel, she’d never felt at home. “It was a formal event and it was an awkward fit!” recalls her 72-year-old sister, Laura, laughing. She accompanied Janis, six years her elder, to the reunion, and wore a dialled-back version of her sister’s fabulous freak-out garb. “Everyone else was in straight, middle-class clothing and teased hair. There was a sense they didn’t quite know what to do about her. But in my mind, and in Janis’s, they should have made her attendance and her success one of the central points to celebrate – ‘Look what someone from our high school has achieved!’ “However, the guy running things thought in terms of how many people had law degrees. It was only when the president of the class said, ‘What about Janis Joplin?’ that everyone stood up and applauded. “I think that hurt her feelings. No matter what she did, she could not get applause from her classmates.” Even then, the recognition was miserly. At the reunion, Janis was symbolically gifted a tyre, to represent “that she’d come the farthest”. And that was meant literally. “That’s what I find most insulting,” says Laura, audibly pained 51 years later. “Instead of being the person who had reached the greatest visible recognition in the country, Janis got a tyre for having travelled the longest distance.” Later that same night, the Joplin girls went to see Jerry Lee Lewis play in Port Arthur. Janis was proud to be able to take her little sister backstage to meet the man, part of “a desire to show she had connections with powerful people.” Nonetheless, it was an “unfortunate experience. He couldn’t have been more rude. He looked at me and looked at her and said: ‘You wouldn’t be bad-looking if you weren’t trying to look like your sister.’ The jerk that he is,” Laura says, witheringly. “That really hurt Janis. So she punched him.” Less than three months later, Janis Joplin was dead. Half a century on from her heroin overdose in Hollywood – midway through the Pearl recording sessions – her visceral, moon-shooting, too-close-to-the-sun artistry and personality are opened up in a lavish new book. Janis Joplin: Days & Summers: Scrapbook 1966–68 is centred on exactly that: Janis’s own scrapbook from those tumultuous two years, the period in which she broke into the international consciousness at 1967’s Monterey Pop Festival and then, the following year, had career-launching US hits with covers of the soul standard Piece of my Heart and George Gershwin’s Summertime. It features newspaper clippings, press photographs, far-out Sixties concert poster art, letters and postcards home, doodles and, in her own handwriting, Janis’s diary entries. “Speaking of England,” begins one 1967 note, “guess who was in town last week – Paul McCartney! (He’s a Beatle.) And he came to see us!!! SIGH.” This ambitious – not to mention pricey – limited-edition book, in part curated by Laura Joplin and her brother Michael, 67, also features pages from an earlier scrapbook, dated 1956 to 1959 and kept by Janis while she was at high school. Alongside those DIY pages are revealing interviews with myriad friends, collaborators, peers and admirers, including Fleetwood Mac, Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane, friend Kris Kristofferson (with whose song, Me and Bobby McGee, Janis had a posthumous US number one in 1971), and fans Michelle Phillips, Jimmy Page and Chrissie Hynde. To quote the last of these, who saw Janis perform in in Richfield, Ohio, “there was just no one else like her – total rebelliousness, abandon, musical excellence and total connection with everyone in the audience. Pure magic. Everybody loved her. She gave us a voice that was anti-establishment, and I’ve lived by it ever since.” This is a deeply personal, kaleidoscopic, hippie-vivid portrait of a woman finding her way in the world, and a window into the dizzying contours of America in the mid- to late-Sixties. Harder to divine is the darkness inside that compelled Janis to overindulge to the extent that it killed her. As Kristofferson describes her in his afterword, which comes in the form of poem titled Epitaph, this was a woman “born so black and blue”. “Janis’s scrapbook has been a personal family thing for such a long time,” begins her brother Michael, down the line from Arizona, “and we’d all looked at it, and laughed and pointed and wondered and cried. And we never felt like sharing that personal, gut-wrenching family thing. But after a while it became obvious that it was something of not just interest but importance. After keeping it that way for decades, it just seemed the right time to do something with it.” As Laura writes in the introduction, from childhood her big sister was always keen on “logging” her life. “It certainly was a steady part of who she was from early on,” she tells me, speaking on the phone from California. “That may have been a reflection of our mother – she chronicled our lives on photo scrapbooks. Janis’s scrapbook told you a lot about what she valued, what was important to her, what gave her joy. I remember her working on that scrapbook in her bedroom, cutting things out and doodling. So there’s a sense of her vitality whenever I look at it. It feels more alive.” Janis stayed in touch with her family after she moved to the West Coast in pursuit of her musical dreams. Michael remembers that move as “the logical progression. There wasn’t much in our town. If you wanted to work at the oil refinery, that was fine. But our parents supported us – if you wanted make music or art, go for it.” In the talismanic summer of 1967, the family made the long car journey to visit San Francisco and see Janis at home and, as it were, in action. For Laura, who had just graduated from school, and Michael, then 14, it was “mindblowing” to tour Haight-Ashbury with their big sister and see her perform with Big Brother at the Avalon Ballroom. Michael even had a go at manning the concert lighting rig. “I’m a wannabe hippie in every aspect,” says Michael, who now makes a living as a glassblower. “And I was so proud of Janis. Everybody in there treated with us absolute respect. There were all in awe of her, and [to us] they were helpful, respectful and kind: ‘Yeah, come on and do the light show! Watch the dancing! Listen to all this!’ Big Brother showed up, and they and the dancers and the hippie freaks were proud that we were there. They were protective, too. They weren’t just Big Brother – they were big brothers.” For Mr and Mrs Joplin, it was a different experience. “They were totally out of their realm,” remembers Michael, “so they were really uncomfortable. But they could see that something was happening. They were small-town Texas people, so just the city itself was mind-blowing. And, of course, nobody knew at the time that the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco, in that Summer of Love, was changing history. We just knew something was going on, but nobody knew what.” Alongside Janis’s mesmerising appeal as a blistering, unfiltered singer was her expression of raw sexuality. Even in the go-go late Sixties, that set her apart. “Part of [her] force is an open sensuality,” wrote The New York Times in April 1968, “with no tinge of coyness or come-on.” “The sex thing they keep trying to lay on me,” she told the newspaper, “is always in the receiver’s head, which is where it should be. If I turn anyone on that way – great! Because that’s what it’s all about.” But it wasn’t entirely accidental. Michael says his sister was a great “salesperson”, meaning: “She knew how to talk to the press, be available to the press… She was trying to sell the music and herself.” Equally, Laura points out, “There wasn’t a cerebral Janis and a [separate] sexual Janis. Her entirety was an expression of her art, and sexuality was part of that.” Likewise, she adds, her sister’s fashion sense. “Our mother raised us to be creative about we wore. Mother sewed, and she always got us involved with designing the clothes we were wearing. So we were using fashion magazines, going to the store and picking fabric. Both Janis and I sewed and made some of our clothes. Mother thought that was a basic skill that women needed to know. “And Janis just took it farther. She combined that knowledge of fabric and shaping it for your body along with her artistic flair. So it really grew.” The bangles up her forearms, the feathers, beads, headgear and layers “all became a real sense of her – decorating your body as an expression of who you are”. But even from early on, there had been a sense that Janis was overdoing everything. Michael remembers an early visit home when his sister was clearly “strung out”, as he writes in the book. “She was obviously not well. I didn’t really understand what was going on, but she came contrite and wanting something different from what she had. And rightly so – she knew that [she had] some problems. Drugs and alcohol were not treated the same as they are now. People were like: ‘You just have to get your act together and everything’ll be OK.’ That’s what she came back to do, to get healthy and to figure out how to proceed in life in a more rational way. But she didn’t know what that was.” Does he mean strung out on heroin? “Ah, well, I mean… I’m still protective of my sister, so I don’t like saying a lot of that. But she was strung out on drugs, and drinking, and being poor as bejesus, and not eating. She was trying to stay afloat, and not able to.” Nonetheless, her good friend and Big Brother bandmate Dave Getz is quoted in the scrapbook thus: “You can’t talk about Janis without talking about heroin.” “There’s probably some truth in that,” allows Michael. “People have accused me of trying to protect her, and of course I do. But she did heroin. She did massive amounts of drugs and alcohol, and she slept around. What am I going to protect her from? So yeah, heroin was definitely involved in her life. She liked to do drugs and alcohol and get laid. What can I say? Everybody did.” In January I interviewed  – who, like Janis, was managed by the fearsome Albert Grossman – and the producer recalled his ultimately ill-fated attempts in early summer 1970 to prepare the groundwork for the recording of Pearl. “I hadn’t worked with an artist like her before,” he told me. “I was very much about the musical aspect, getting everyone together to do a performance in the studio somehow, and not mess around too much with the psychology or play head games. “And Janis, I think, hated making records. She loved playing live. That was her life – to get up in front of an audience, freak out and do her thing. But she was just never comfortable in the studio because there was no audience.” Equally, he added, “she in some ways was like a crazy teenager. She’d suddenly go off on a whim of some kind. I recall being in her house in Mill Valley [near San Francisco], and a bunch of people are coming in with songs for her, and then I get a call in from Janis: ‘I’m gonna be late, I’m at the police station!’ “Five minutes later, I walk past her bedroom, and the door’s open and she’s in there with some guy! She’s calling from her own bedroom, making excuses for not showing up because she doesn’t want to get out of bed with some guy she’s picked up the night before!” Rundgren eventually left the project after recording moved to Los Angeles. As he admits, “it became apparent that I didn’t have the touch to get her to deliver in the studio. But after that they formed a band for her and that helped a lot – she finally had a musical unit she could interact with, and abandon herself to. And they found another producer, Paul Rothchild, whose style was completely different from mine. Mine was: ‘Let’s make some music in here.’ His was: ‘Let’s make everybody feel real good in here, and maybe the music will happen.’” The sessions, though, came to an abrupt halt on October 4 when Janis was found dead in her hotel room. For Mick Fleetwood, who knows of what he speaks, it was a sadly inevitable outcome of the hedonism of the scene. “Yes, she was a child in a toy shop,” he says in Days & Summers, “and it just became too much for her.” “None of us knew what we were doing with drugs – we were young and stupid,” admits Grace Slick. “We were either having a good time with them, or using them to calm down. When you felt bad, you’d go shoot some heroin or drink some alcohol or whatever. Everybody was doing it. Heroin is really tricky, because you only take a small dose and so then you think: ‘Oh, I’ll have a little bit more.’ But a little bit more will kill you.” Her death, terribly, was a sign of the times. “That whole rock star thing caught up with her, as it did with a lot of pop idols in the early Seventies,” says Rundgren of a singer who was an early member of what Kurt Cobain’s grief-stricken mother later called “that stupid club” – musicians who were dead at 27. Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison were all that age when they died between 1969 and 1971. “There was this feeling of invincibility going around,” the producer continues. “Once you’d achieved that stardom, you got giddy. And it was proven several times over that these people weren’t invincible, with Morrison and Hendrix and Joplin all dropping like flies.” But it was, of course, also an awful family tragedy. When the news came, Laura was in Dallas, where she’d begun graduate school. She was at home alone in her shared apartment. “It was very difficult,” she says now, “to be surrounded by silence when internally I was very empty.” Michael was at home in Port Arthur. The call came in the middle of the night, and his father woke him in the morning. “He could barely get the words out. He said, ‘Your sister’s dead’, then he had to leave the room, because he was gonna lose it. “What was really weird was that I wanted to go tell somebody, and have that conversation with my best friend: ‘My sister passed away.’ But he already knew. ‘How did you know?’ ‘It was on the radio.’ That was my first taste that I didn’t have any [private] family thing about this. And my parents were not able to deal with that at all. It was so talked about – it was on the national freaking news!” In fact, so was Michael. When his parents travelled to California to make the arrangements, they left him at home. “They were afraid to have me part of that scene, which I understand. But they also didn’t realise that Dan Rather was going to call the house. And I’m there, waiting for them to call, so I answer the phone and I’m 17, talking to Dan Rather on the nightly news! We were just unaware of what was going to be transpiring. “That was a really hard time,” he continues. “My idol was dead. And it was tough. Mostly, if you ever lose a family member, they go away. And your memories are what keep them alive in you. But with this, I’m talking to you 50 years after – it’s crazy, a weird thing. You’ve got your perceptions of Janis, I have mine, and I can’t change everyone else’s.” Given the cultural lionisation – and the tearing down – of various Sixties and Seventies musical legends in the decades since, it’s remarkable that there’s been no film of the life of Janis Joplin. That’s not for the want of trying, notes Michael. Over the years, multiple actresses have been linked to the role, including Pink, Amy Adams, Michelle Williams and Courtney Love. “There’s been a lot of people in the talk, and until it happens, it’s only all talk. For a long time I was holding my breath, then I gave up because I started turning blue. Now I’m like, if you want to do it, you better come to me with something real. Until then, it’s just BS. It’s Hollywood, man. I have a drawer full of scripts!” But nothing that he and Laura thought was up to snuff? “We didn’t stop anything. We have never said no to anybody. I would love to have had Pink involved. But things just don’t happen – the funding fell through, or whatever. It’s just that kind of stuff. I’m not an a--hole or anything. If they can figure out how to make it happen, we’ll support them, if it’s good.” For Laura, looking after her sister’s memory – the family have been careful not to overexploit her legacy – “helped me heal a lot. Talking with people, feeling the incredible love they have for her, really helped me get more anchored. In that regard it’s a pleasure to listen and hear what she meant to people.” Also, she points out, for all the sense of a depressed and doom-laden mythos that’s attended her sister in subsequent years, “the thing that can sometimes be overlooked is: she was so much fun to be around. Janis was a high-energy girl who had an unending curiosity.” Or, as Janis said to Eye magazine in June 1968: “I have at least a thousand people inside of me and I don’t know which is the real me.” Those qualities are all over the deluxe, coffee-table pages of Janis Joplin: Days & Summers: Scrapbook 1966–68. Immerse yourself in the mind and soul and chaos of Joplin’s too-short life and career, and you understand why her siblings might still want their sister’s story told on screen, but told right. “There’s been a lot of powerful woman that wanted to portray her,” says Michael, “because Janis is a perfect story in every aspect. It’s like Shakespeare.”",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/captain-toms-secrets-long-life-patience-positivity-porridge/,culture,"A year ago a shocked and baffled Britain began to receive its first doses of the spirited optimism of the World War II veteran and charity fundraiser  – something that gave the nation’s well-being, in those otherwise bleak weeks of the first lockdown, a boost every bit as valuable as anything AstraZeneca has come up with.  There was something extraordinarily touching about this man, who had managed to live 100 years without having his belief in the decency of human beings or his faith in the future knocked out of him, assuring us that “tomorrow will be a good day”. Many of us were hoicked out of real dejection by the example of someone who had survived not just the Second World War but all the various setbacks and tragedies that befall anybody who lives a long life, and still had a smile on his face.  It is appropriate, then, that in the final months before his death in February, Captain Tom was distilling his wisdom into this last book, a paean to the power of positive thinking. It’s a sort of self-help manual on how to will yourself into the state of mind that will get you to your 100th birthday.  The first chapter offers a few practical tips on how to achieve longevity. Moore had porridge for breakfast every day from boyhood, even asking the Army cooks to prepare it for him specially when he served in the jungles of the Far East. He always ate healthily and moderately – he is “staggered” by today’s portion sizes – and never smoked. He was only drunk enough to be hungover once in his life, when he had too much brandy in Kashmir “in order to impress a lass”. He boasts – and has every right to – of being free of diabetes and high blood pressure in his second century.  The bulk of the book, however, is about adopting the sort of attitudes to life that will make you feel it is worth the candle. Take pleasure in what you have, and don’t envy what you don’t; remember during bad times that everything passes; find ways of helping other people; take pride in your appearance (he never ventured out of the house in his “gardening clothes”); remember the value of “a certain amount of discipline and order” in your life.  He admits to being sad that there’s nobody left to reminisce with about “trams or Zeppelins, parkin, woollen swimwear, weekly baths or gaslights”, but advises his fellow oldies to embrace the Internet and befriend as many young people as possible. For the younger generations he provides a list of questions that might get oldsters to open up their treasure trove of stories: “If you ask us about the most dangerous, risqué or surprising things we ever did, or which was our happiest decade, I promise you’ll be in for a treat.” Having children at 50 helped to keep him young, he says, and I suspect he is right to think that employers missed out on a valuable resource when he found no takers on his attempt to re-enter the job market in his late 80s.  The book is not entirely free of self-help sententiousness (“The overgrown track is always the more interesting option than the well-trodden path”) but if it sometimes veers a little too far towards the impersonal, it’s always quickly rescued by some illustrative reminiscence. He writes – all the more movingly for being matter-of-fact – about growing up with a deaf father and how it taught him self-reliance, which led in turn to his being comfortable in his own skin and never minding what other people thought. As a husband and father, for instance, he never minded being “the only chap doing the ironing or taking the family washing to the launderette”.  Inevitably he quotes the motto of his old regiment, the Duke of Wellington’s – “Fortune Favours the Brave” – but he is less interested in talking about his wartime heroics than the courage it took to bring his unhappy first marriage to an end, or to accept that he could no longer look after his second wife after she became ill and to put her in a home.  He stresses the importance of heroes and role models, and the  objects of his admiration include  ,   and  ; nobody, however, matches Vera Lynn, who risked her life to entertain Moore and the rest of the troops in the Burmese jungle.  Above all, he insists that golden opportunities can always be salvaged from missteps and mishaps. Although he was not desperate to be conscripted, he thinks that the comradeship he found in the Army saved him from being “a rather self-contained and isolated person”. Later on the collapse of his family business led to his taking jobs as a labourer and a salesman for Woman’s Own (“I was too soft-hearted to be a salesman... never quite able to seal the deal”) but he built up contacts that enabled him to become a more successful businessman than ever. And then, of course, if he had not suffered a severe and debilitating fall in later life, he would never have embarked on the fundraising walk round his garden for NHS charities that earned him a knighthood and international adoration.  He also admits that his “competitive spirit” has aided his determination to keep going, and at one point admits that he has his eye on the record for the oldest person to go skydiving, which currently stands at 103. It’s hard not to finish the book, counter-intuitively, with the feeling that its 100-year-old author was cut off in his prime. But at least it gives us a chance to spend a bit longer in his company, to enjoy his wry humour again and to understand how his apparently ordinary life equipped him for his final extraordinary year.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/mauritanian-review-cumberbatch-guantanamo-no-ones-idea-thrill/,culture,"Kevin Macdonald’s The Mauritanian is a legal thriller of sorts, but one with a timeline that sets about defeating suspense: a 14-year incarceration without trial at Guantánamo would squeeze the hope, or second-act tension, out of anyone’s life story. It follows Mohamedou Ould Salahi (Tahar Rahim), a detainee from Mauritania   two months after 9/11, as part of the CIA’s program of extraordinary rendition. While in prison, he wrote a tell-all memoir, published as Guantánamo Diary a year before he was finally released. Pursuing the idea that he was a major figure in al Qaeda’s recruitment drive, the authorities had little to go on except old connections and family ties. In the early 1990s, when barely out of his teens, Salahi had trained with al Qaeda to help topple the communist government of Najibullah in Afghanistan, a coup the US were actually backing at the time. Meanwhile, his cousin was a spiritual adviser to Osama bin Laden and therefore another person of interest, though he had opposed the 9/11 attacks and left al Qaeda soon after they occurred. No matter: sifting through this kind of fog of motivation was exactly the purpose Guantánamo was designed to serve, even if years and years drag by on screen, with ever-worsening interrogation methods, and nothing concrete materialises. Salahi might still be there if it weren’t for his legal team, headed pro bono by a formidable defence attorney called Nancy Hollander (Jodie Foster), who flies to Cuba with a colleague to do the translating ( ). They’re surprised to find that Salahi, resourceful in his rather antic way, has picked up a solid grasp of English from the guards and fellow prisoners. While these two organise his defence, it falls to a military prosecutor called Lt Col Stuart Couch (Benedict Cumberbatch) to bring him to trial, with evidence that could be described as circumstantial at best – like Salahi deleting all the numbers off his phone, to protect family members, in the moments before his arrest. Everything hinges on a confession the military has up its sleeve. By now, at Guantánamo, we know how that goes: the darkest flashbacks, well into the second hour here, are a nightmarish vision of sleep deprivation, heavy metal blasts, horror masks, sexual humiliation and water boarding. Classified to high heaven as these methods all were, the defence have no access to them, and Salahi has all but blocked the scribbled confession from his memory. Even Couch is flooded with doubts about whether he can make a conviction stick: on paper he’s the chief antagonist, but Cumberbatch, well-deployed with his clipped official manner, is a figure of conscience being hung out to dry, just as horrified as the defence about the various coercions behind bars.  Woodley’s role is pretty feeble – with translating out, her main function is bringing along snacks – but Foster is briskly effective in a tidy grey wig, as an unsentimental counsel ever-ready with her set spiel that even the guilty need legal advice. When she places a hand on Salahi’s, late into the film, it’s a pivot towards compassion in light of everything he’s gone through. The Mauritanian has more of a pulse than The Report, last year’s bone-dry procedural about the US Senate’s investigation into CIA torture, but there’s a feeling of being peddled old news which it periodically struggles to enliven. It’s naggingly amorphous and lacking in dramatic friction, falling too often into a docudrama no-man’s-land. A handful of bad eggs in the military may have pushed the button on ignoring Salahi’s human rights, but all these moments are redacted from the record and might as well be from the script. Neither Macdonald nor his screenwriters have wrestled Salahi’s story into riveting shape as cinema. What lifts it to a major degree is Rahim’s performance. We know little of Salahi’s life outside Guantánamo, dealing with him as a virtual blank slate, but he fills this in with a remarkably charismatic personality, riven with contradictions, and clinging to bursts of mischievous humour as a survival strategy. Rahim made his breakthrough behind bars, as the French-Algerian convict learning the ropes in Jacques Audiard’s A Prophet (2009), but we get an utterly different sense of a person here, right down to the set of his teeth, the amount of sly eye contact he makes, his persistence with the sign-off “see you later, alligator”. It’s inspired work in the rather dogged circumstances.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/theatre-snobs-get-behind-game-thrones-might-actually-enjoy/,culture,"It was inevitable, I suppose. Game of Thrones, the HBO fantasy phenomenon that became  , is to turn into a stage show destined for both Broadway and our own West End. Theatre snobs may roll their eyes and whinge about a lack of imagination in commissioning; many will say it’s a cynical money-making exercise and a sign of cultural moribundity. But that would be short-sighted. The combination of two talented individuals, director Dominic Cooke (in my view, one of the greatest artistic directors of the past few decades) and writer Duncan MacMillan (whose 2015 play People, Places and Things made me literally gasp for breath) suggests that this extravaganza will be, to paraphrase actor Ian McShane – who appeared in Game of Thrones on TV – more than just “t---s and dragons”. It is my hope that, once we have come out of a lockdown that has devastated the sector, a new direction for theatre will emerge which is both sensible and free of the political agendas that have dominated the sector in recent years. Ultimately, the industry needs to realise that shows such as Game of Thrones are going to be instrumental in alleviating their considerable financial woes and inspiring a public who desperately need cheering up. There is also a by-product to all this. As we have seen with the phenomenal success of  , theatre can be highly effective in connecting us, in a visceral way, to something read on the page or seen on screen. The cinematic world inspired by JK Rowling is a mere shadow of what Jack Thorne, John Tiffany and Sonia Friedman’s production achieved at the Palace Theatre: emotionally engaged and (yes) much more magical. And, aside from Game of Thrones, there are other big ventures afoot. There’s the new Doctor Who immersive theatrical experience, Time Fracture, and postponed productions of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cinderella and Frozen (the latter based on the successful Disney franchise). The return of theatre as spectacle suddenly looks tangible and thrilling. I am not trying to be a Pangloss or Pollyanna. I realise that theatre must challenge us, and provoke big questions about the world we live in, but at the moment it has such obstacles to overcome – principally, the salvage of the livelihoods of those working in the industry – that, when it returns, its mission to entertain must be paramount. The sector needs to be free, too, from the constraints of woke agitation – for examples,   – which have proved so corrosive, so resistant to artistic freedom on the stage. Although the phrase “learning from history” is unconvincing – can we ever really “learn” from history? – I think we could do worse than look at our 18th-century ancestors, whose reputation for unbridled (and licentious) entertainment gave a fillip to the industry. Despite a new stability, brought about by Britain’s aloofness from the conflicts raging through Europe, life for the majority of people in Georgian Britain was tough. Precipitated by the Industrial Revolution, there were dire conditions, overcrowding in our cities and little in the way of human rights. Nevertheless, with booming literacy came a growing appetite for culture in all its forms – and in particular, light relief. These conditions made the 18th century the golden age of theatre. Vast auditoria were built in order to accommodate punters from different social backgrounds who enjoyed different sorts of entertainment. There was a growing interest in Shakespeare, albeit in radically altered productions (spoiler alert: neither King Lear nor Cordelia died in the productions of the 1700s). There were, meanwhile, new hits such as John Gay’s The Beggar’s Opera, and high demand for acrobats, tightrope walkers and the like. Most importantly, this was the age that gave lifeblood to London’s West End. Despite the constraints imposed by the Licensing Act of 1737, which gave the Lord Chamberlain the final say on what did and what didn’t get produced – and remained in place until 1968 – theatre was given a new vigour by actor-managers such as David Garrick, who embodied a new populism and ushered in a radical acting style that was more realistic and less mannered. Far be it from me to suggest that we should reintroduce cock-fighting or badger-baiting into the ecology of post-pandemic live events. But there was a pragmatism in the spirit of the British under the Hanoverians, and we in 2021 could all be inspired by it. Despite the gloom that has descended on the industry I love, I feel optimistic for the future of theatre. It will emerge from the fog of the past year leaner, but (I hope) with a renewed sense of purpose, and a clear vision of what is important. Westeros may seem like a world away from what, to many people, the West End should be about, but popular spectacles such as this should not be faulted. They are going to play a crucial part in London’s recovery – and that of the world of theatre beyond it.    ",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/radio/what-to-listen-to/alas-poor-rsc-will-left-pandemic-done/,culture,"‘This green plot shall be our stage,” announces Peter Quince in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, foreshadowing the era of open-air theatre that may be about to open up before us as lockdown eases. Shakespeare knew all about disease outbreaks and their choking effect on theatres. It seems such a long time ago now, when the first lockdown began last year, that everyone talked about how Shakespeare wrote King Lear during a plague lockdown when theatres were closed. (History remains silent on the number of Jaffa Cakes he ate out of sheer despair in that time.) More than 400 years on, theatres have been struggling with plague closures again, as   (Tuesday, World Service) explored. Karl Bos presented and produced this loving and contemplative behind-the-scenes look at how the   has navigated the pandemic, with contributions from RSC actors David Tennant and Noma Dumezweni, as well as Artistic Director   and Deputy Artistic Director Erica Whyman. Bos’s interviews took place at various points over the last year, and most heartbreaking was the sense of confidence, in the early conversations, that the pandemic was a storm that the theatrical behemoth that is the RSC, among the most firmly established and financially robust of all British theatre companies, was prepared to weather.  The RSC had kept paying its actors for as long as possible, while planning new projects using every technology they could think of. Initially they were bullish about their ability to ride it out. But a company that size costs a lot of money to run, and without any income from ticket sales, the coffers wouldn’t hold out for long. Panic soon crept in. In Shakespeare’s day, theatres were closed due to plague for long stretches of time. Obviously, it didn’t damage his legacy. His spirit lives on in the RSC management, but although the actors who contributed to the programme were passionate and determined, Bos’s conversations with Doran and Whyman sounded much less certain. There was fear in their voices for the fate of a beloved institution. We heard of the future, too, and the RSC’s plans for staging A Winter’s Tale for the screen, which will centre on a few key “electrifying” moments of physical touch, and of the company’s marking out of a new outdoor theatre space in which to stage fresh-air performances. The atmosphere was mournful for what we’ve lost, but still hopeful in the face of lockdown gloom. Bos asked Doran for a message from Shakespeare that might speak to how it will feel when we’re finally allowed to gather together again, waiting for a play to begin. Doran chose lines from Sonnet 67: “How like a winter hath my absence been from thee.” When Radio 3 plays Nirvana, you know that either something is very wrong, or that something radical is about to go down. It was the latter in   (Sunday, Radio 3), which began with the unmistakable power chord riff of Smells Like Teen Spirit.  A long way from 19th-century French poetry? Not really: the point of the programme was to explore Charles Baudelaire’s “transgressive” and “dangerous” resonance today, as well as his history as an inspiration for tortured countercultural heroes from Mick Jagger to Kurt Cobain and beyond. John Cooper Clarke, the poet who calls himself a “Bargain Basement Baudelaire”, said that he sees his own countercultural habits and drug use as pretty lightweight compared to Baudelaire’s daily mercury injections. The title of the programme was annoyingly po-faced and, thankfully, didn’t really represent the content at all. Presenter Michèle Roberts and producer Sara Jane Hall, did, however, elegantly draw a picture of the history of the bohemian flâneur and society’s double standard when it came to the treatment of women in 19th-century Paris, particularly when in relation to living a life of art, drugs and sex.  In the modern era of #MeToo (and its more in-your-face French equivalent, #balancetonporc, or “expose your pig”), what’s it like to read Baudelaire’s sexually exoticised, sometimes dissociated poems about women? Compelling, disturbing and vital, it turns out.  This programme was by no means the invitation to cancel Baudelaire that its title suggested; instead it presented Baudelaire’s work as eternal literature to surprise and unsettle us, and a mirror to confront our own most taboo darknesses, as real now as they were 200 years ago. The conclusion was hard to argue with: “Everybody should read Baudelaire, damn it.”",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/consigning-bbc-four-repeats-betrayal-itsreithian-intentions/,culture,"A decade ago,   felt like the jewel in the Corporation’s crown. It was responsible for several great dramas (including an acclaimed string of biopics featuring such figures as  , Tony Hancock and Margaret Thatcher), the occasional hit sitcom ( ), and - its lifeblood - a raft of great documentaries, not least those with an arts focus. It also, of course, introduced us to the irresistible gloom of Nordic noir with shows such as   and  . Yet there has been a downward slide, both in terms of quality and output, with fewer original programmes being made (currently repeats account for 76 per cent of its broadcast hours). Thus, the announcement in the Corporation's Annual Plan for 2021-2022, that BBC Four would “become the home of the most distinctive content from across the BBC’s archive” feels crushingly inevitable; a sort of demotion for a channel that the big bosses fell out of love with, even if viewers like me didn’t. I always felt that the intentions of BBC Four were noble: Reithian certainly, sometimes accessible, and sometimes inspirational in their intellectual ambition (note the channel’s commitment to the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures). But in recent years there has been a tendency to demystify - particularly in its documentaries - so that programmes became more like conventional primers on a certain subject (all those   history shows for example), than carefully thought-out authored pieces by great iconoclasts (I will never forget punk poet ’s wonderfully hallucinatory take on Thomas de Quincey’s Confessions of an Opium Eater).  BBC Four has also had to contend with the rise of  , a veritable commissioning machine which has muscled in on its turf and, last year, ended up moving to Freeview - seemingly a “tanks on the lawn” moment. The Sky channel might not be high profile, but there is no doubt that it has taken away some of BBC Four’s sense of purpose. Certainly, I feel sad that BBC Four is being relegated to a repeats channel. Surely, iPlayer is already a repository for that - with plenty of good stuff from the archive, to boot? But as well as losing its raison d’etre, my main concern is what this all means for arts programming, long considered by many to be the Cinderella of British television. Yes, the ratings are usually low, but there is more to it than that, particularly when you bear in mind that the BBC is a supposedly non-commercial broadcaster. Arts programmes bring prestige, and also a form of education for those who do not have immediate access to concerts or galleries or theatres. The million-dollar question is how far BBC Two (in a pre-digital world a natural home for the arts) will be committed to culture coverage. Certainly they have already stated that they will double their investment in arts and music over the next two years with a swathe of programmes announced, including Mary Beard on forbidden art, and a sweeping history of British creativity.  This seems all well and good, but something within the report made me feel a little anxious. It reads thus: “We will deliver more value to audiences by focusing on unique, high impact content, commissioning fewer but bigger titles of higher quality that can reach more audiences and with more opportunities for creative innovation.”  Apart from the fact that this reads like something that was written by a computer not a human being, it also suggests that there is going to be an obsession with “flagship shows” or “high impact content” which means only the big beasts (shows such as the critically mauled  , which the report goes on to mention) will get a look in. At the height of BBC Four’s success, you could always guarantee something which was ostensibly niche but had a terrifically strong narrative thread to hook you in. I am thinking of something like Jonathan Meades’s  , which honed in on the much-maligned county to uncover a story of Victorian social experimentation and artistic dissent. It would be hard to imagine such an excellent standalone piece being given airtime on BBC Two now.  Of course, BBC Four’s fortunes are now contrasting widely with those of its original sister channel BBC Three like heroines in a Victorian novel. The Corporation have been upfront about their aim to pursue younger viewers in an increasingly fragmented age, and returning BBC Three to a mainstream TV audience is a sensible move, but it’s sad to think that its more rarefied sibling doesn’t hold the same value. ",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2021/04/01/bbc-should-use-holy-week-reflect-anti-christian-bias/,culture,"To a large section of the population this week,  , will be no different from any other week of the year; perhaps remarkable this year only inasmuch as it marks the beginning of the slow easing of our escape from  .  It is different for the country’s dwindling band of observant Christians for whom this week, leading up to Easter Sunday, is a solemn time of remembrance when we try to penetrate the mystery of Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection and remind ourselves of why this event, some two millennia ago, still matters. The rest of the country looks on with a largely benign indifference, accepting Easter, like Christmas, merely as a public holiday stripped of its religious significance. This will be a matter of regret for many sincere Christians who may be asking themselves why it is that this society, which only a few decades ago was so much more explicitly religious, has altered so swiftly? Why it is that religious practice is such a minority pursuit and why an understanding of the fundamentals of the Christian religion cannot now be taken for granted even among supposedly educated people?  And if they dig deep enough they should conclude that part of the answer to those questions lies with the way our broadcasters treat religion. We now live in an era in which the mass media, for better or worse, shapes our public morality. Observing this changed landscape, many social conservatives are apt to point the finger of blame at the Church of England itself; it is the C of E, they say, which by bending before the prevailing wind of permissive liberal attitudes has allowed the old Christian morality to be repudiated and replaced by a new ""media morality"".  This new morality, in essence, tells people that fusty old notions of ""sin"" can be dispensed with because they have no substance. Criticisms of the Anglican church do have some force (Private Eye’s parodic Rev. J.C. Flannel seems sometimes more documentary than imaginary) but are also unfair in my view. The Church faces, in the shape of our media, an opponent which vastly out-guns it in terms of reach and influence. Which is why the remarks by the Bishop of Ripon, the Rt, Rev Helen-Ann Hartley in the Radio Times are worthy of note.   Bishop Hartley   where safely ""siloed away"" as she puts it, the Corporation can fulfil its quota of ""religious broadcasting"" without troubling the general audience overmuch. And she asks a pertinent question:  “Where are the documentaries that challenge us to rethink the world we live in? Or the dramas that ask us to re-imagine our human relationships? Instead of congratulating itself on producing more content than ever, I wonder if it’s time for the BBC to ask just what is the point of religion on the telly, or the radio for that matter?”  Good question, Bishop. The truth is that the BBC shies away from any explanation of the ills that afflict contemporary society which might undermine belief in the tenets of a permissive, liberal, interpretation of ""progress"". The BBC seemingly does not wish to engage with ideas that implicitly cast doubt on the benefits of our modern morality. Nor does it wish to explore the debt that the liberalism it so enthusiastically embraces owes to Christianity; for, in truth, without Christianity there would be no liberalism. No one has more deeply studied this phenomenon and better understood it than the political philosopher Sir Larry Siedentop, whose book Inventing the Individual – the Origins of Western Liberalism is an indispensable guide to understanding how we came to be as we are. As he trenchantly states in that book : “….in its basic assumptions, liberal thought is the offspring of Christianity”. And this matters greatly because as the influence of Christianity wanes in Britain, and throughout the western world, the danger surely is that liberalism itself will be imperilled.  Siedentop’s crucial insight is that the Christian notion of the uniqueness of every human being made ""in the image and likeness of God"" and endowed with an immortal soul is a deeply subversive one. Subversive because anyone who understands this concept and acts in good conscience on it can never be a supporter of an unjust hierarchical society where some people are treated as  unworthy and lesser beings. If practised sincerely the ‘Golden Rule’  that one should ""treat one’s neighbour as oneself"" is a surefire insurance against cruelty and injustice.  Siedentop points out that in the ancient world of the Greeks and Romans, slaves were accepted as part of the natural order and were – in a chilling phrase – regarded as ""living tools"". As Christianity took root and spread it inevitably undermined the whole notion of slavery which is why (even though it took hundreds of years and was sometimes disgracefully re-introduced in the pursuit of profit), slavery was abolished in western Europe.  So what has this to do with religious broadcasting and the BBC? Only this: that in order to understand our society, so concerned as it is with ""rights"" we have to understand where the notion of ""human rights"" comes from. And properly understood that leads ineluctably back to basic Christian teaching. But this is an understanding constantly frustrated by the BBC’s secular instinct which is to ascribe all that is good in our society to the Enlightenment of the 18th century and the insights of the leading intellectual figures of that period.  I was forcibly struck by this when listening a few days ago to an interview on the Today programme with Professor Richard Dawkins. The grand old man of militant atheism recently turned 80 and has published a new book. The BBC, ever-eager to promote a man who it clearly feels has vanquished the primitive superstitions of the Christian religion, gave him the usual courtesy of promoting his tome at length and conducted another fawning interview (this time by Nick Robinson).  In it he was allowed to state, yet again, that science explains all and will lead us all to a better world. But he was spared any thoughtful or difficult questions. He might, for instance, have been asked something like ""Would the strictly rational principles of science lead to the abolition of slavery? And if so how and why?"" Because, as far as I can see, science offers no moral insights whatsoever. They come from a different part of the intellectual spectrum – a part that people like Dawkins dismiss as make-believe.  The BBC’s worldview consciously militates against incorporating in its output an understanding of religion and its importance in human affairs. This is, in my experience, primarily because the BBC is staffed by people contemptuous of, and often also ignorant of, Christian history and teachings. Most programme-makers in the BBC are highly educated folk who have come through the atheistic degree-factories of Oxbridge. Many of these pocket intellectuals seem to think that all human progress began when the beliefs that dominated the years they call the ""Dark Ages"" were discarded in favour of the rational ideas of people like Voltaire.  In fact – as Siedentop clearly demonstrates – the truth is the exact opposite of this. Throughout the post-Roman era into the middle ages and the early-modern period the intuitions of Christianity, nurtured by Christian institutions like the monasteries, made for a constant improvement in the human condition – at least in Western Europe. But our modern intellectual class (to whom BBC people largely belong) reject the Christian contribution to western civilisation - which is immeasurable. This has led to distorted news values; it is why, for instance, the BBC rightly reports extensively on the plight of the   but consistently underplays the persecution of Christians in Muslim countries like Pakistan. In its skewed view the BBC seems to think that highlighting and campaigning for better treatment for Christians would show some kind of favouritism whereas, by championing the cause of the Muslim Uighurs it demonstrates its ""impartiality"". It is a shockingly partisan stance which only demonstrates the Corporation’s inherent antagonism towards Christianity. Over the years there have been many complaints about the BBC’s perceived anti-Christian stance – something we might term its ""Christophobia"". Back in 2011 Cardinal Keith O’Brien, the RC leader of Scotland’s Catholics, commissioned research into BBC news coverage after which he levelled the charge that the BBC was institutionally biased against Christianity. Peter Sissons, for many years one of the BBC’s most recognisable newsreaders, wrote in his memoirs about the Corporation’s animus against Christianity; he said the BBC saw Christians as ""fair game"". And just a few years ago a BBC World Service journalist of 30 years’ standing, Catherine Utley, went public with criticisms of how the BBC covers stories involving Christians. So Bishop Helen-Ann’s strictures on the BBC’s religious programmes are in good company. But the BBC will likely take no notice of her whatsoever. She will be airily dismissed along with all the complaints of those listed above – and many others. Supremely confident of its own good intentions, and convinced of its own superior wisdom, the BBC is leading our society down the wrong path. And that, in this Holy Week, is my Thought for the Day.  ",0

There will be four phases to the easing of restrictions, but where do the arts fit in? Indoor performances will resume on or around May 17, as part of Step Three of the Government’s plan, with capacity  limited to up to 1,000 people. Normal outdoor performances of up to 4,000 attendees, as well as seated outdoor performances for up to 10,000 attendees, can also resume. Larger indoor performances will be back no earlier than June 21, as part of Step Four. The Prime Minister also suggested that rapid testing might be introduced as part of the return of larger performances. Hairspray at the Coliseum is  scheduled to open to the general public in June, while Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cinderella and The Prince of Egypt will open in July. Some other big West End shows have postponed their planning openings for this year, including Sister Act, Frozen, and Get Up, Stand Up: The Bob Marley Musical.  Social distancing will remain in place until at least June 21. It has a decisive effect on whether shows are financially viable or not, since it reduces the audience capacity dramatically, in some cases to one-third or less. Most shows need around 70 to 80 per cent of seats filled merely to break even. As a result, if social distancing continues into mid-summer or later, many venues might delay re-opening, as they work out whether they can actually afford to keep putting on shows with reduced audiences, or whether it’s best to wait and save their resources for now. Inside the auditorium, audiences should expect most Covid precautions to remain in place – such as compulsory mask-wearing during performances, the use of e-tickets and card payments rather than cash, one-way systems and frequent use of hand sanitiser. It is not yet clear whether venues will require any proof of vaccine, or will continue to do temperature checks at the door as they did in 2020. Drive-in cinemas can reopen from April 12, while indoor cinemas will return on May 17 or soon after. The range of films on offer will most likely feel bare compared to pre-Covid times but song-delayed blockbusters including  , starring Tom Cruise, Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical In The Heights, and Marvel's Black Widow, which have all moved to mid-summer releases, will capitalise on the timing. The much delayed Bond film,  , however, is unlikely to brought forward from its current November date. The experience for cinemagoers will likely be similar to 2020. Most chains were maintaining social-distancing measures across all areas within the cinema, and offering hand sanitiser to all ticket holders and employees, while toilets were stocked with anti-bacterial hand soap and staff had been given stringent hand-washing guidelines. Since last year, booking systems have been updated to allow friends and family to sit together while ensuring a safe distance between customers from different households in the auditoria. Start and end times for films were being staggered to regulate crowding, and one-way systems operated throughout the buildings. Face coverings were mandatory. Museums will be able to re-open from May 17; while art galleries were not specifically mentioned in the announcement, it is assumed that they will also re-open then. Jean Dubuffet: Brutal Beauty at the Barbican will open on May 17; Matthew Barney: Redoubt and Igshaan Adams: Kicking Dust at the Hayward Gallery will open on May 19. Major spring and summer exhibitions, like the V&A’s Alice, Whitechapel Gallery’s Eileen Agar and Tate Modern’s Rodin, are expected to open from the earliest possible dates. Mask wearing, limited advanced booking and social distancing measures will remain in place until at least June 21. Indoor concerts of up to 1,000 attendees, outdoor performances of up to 4,000, and seated outdoor performances of up to 10,000 can resume from May 17, while larger indoor and non-seated outdoor performances could be back from June 21. Pilot events to gauge the feasibility of that timescale will be running from April. This looks like excellent news for summer music festivals. While Glastonbury had to cancel its 2021 plans, many other major events, including Reading and Leeds, The Isle of Wight, and Wireless, have  Thanks to bubble systems and regular testing, many shows resumed production in 2020 and have continued into the new year.

The last of these, to my mind, have proved the most effective as a viewing experience, since they’re specifically designed for that medium – and our couch-bound attention span. “I’m not sure people want to sit in front of full-length ballets at home,” Nixon agrees. “The energy and focus in the theatre keeps people engaged.” Post-pandemic, I’d hope to see more practitioners making a virtue of the digital turn, as that’s what the best ones have done this past year: we’ve had the wit of Corey Baker’s Swan Lake Bath Ballet, the ingenuity of Sophie Laplane’s Indoors, the hard-hitting provocation of Jonzi D’s Our Bodies Back.

It’s a way for dance to sell itself to new audiences – not always its strongest suit. “People often say ‘I don’t like ballet’,” Nixon says, “but they’ve never actually seen it. They just think of tutus and men in tights. Part of our job is to get a broader audience to understand that the menu has changed. Some of our online pieces are almost short films first, dance second.” This might be a way to close the gap between TikTok crazes and Swan Lake. “Perhaps there’s an audience that isn’t interested in sitting in a theatre, but will watch our work on an iPad.” The problem, as ever, will be financial. As an alternative business model, digital “is not yet realistic,” says Tamara Rojo, English National Ballet’s artistic director and lead principal. “We’re a company of 70 dancers and 60 musicians. We need to perform in theatres.” Unfortunately, that’s still a way off: the Government’s roadmap has venues reopening no earlier than May 17, and with full audiences – theoretically – in June. And companies such as ENB also need to know whether they can tour productions any time soon. That’s a major way of democratising dance: companies bring it to your local theatre, and at a reasonable price. National tours involve moving easily around the UK. “Will we be allowed to do that?” Rojo worries. “Dance is a people-heavy art form: a big classical ballet means a full company, musicians, backstage workers. We’re paying for travel and hotels. It’s expensive.” Beyond our borders, too, there are worries about travel arrangements. Normally, ENB’s national tours make a loss, but they’re subsided by their international ones. The latter are more profitable, Rojo explains, because “those producers have bigger budgets, and we can form commercial partnerships, or perform at high-paying festivals.” Might this mean raising UK ticket prices, at least while social distancing is still in place? It’s an adamant no. “We supply thousands of tickets for as little as £12. That’s part of our mission.” And when audiences come back, what will they see on stage? Dance isn’t usually the most reactive artform, since productions have such long lead-times. Recently, though, the best works have shown new boldness and urgency. Last October, for example, I was moved by Will Tuckett’s Lazuli Sky for Birmingham Royal Ballet, a one-act piece that drew on our rediscovery of nature during lockdown. Nixon doesn’t feel as though he needs to put Covid on stage just yet: “Maybe in a year or two, when we come back to reflect on it.” But Rojo thinks some work is ripe for fresh resonance: her forthcoming Florence Nightingale-inspired reworking of Petipa’s Raymonda will honour the nursing profession. Rojo herself is an optimist: she reckons we’re going to see “an artistic renaissance” post-pandemic. Sadly, it won’t involve everyone. Some have already left the industry, hit by the triple whammy of no work prospects, no financial support and the loss of intensive physical training. Dancers, at this level, are akin to Olympic athletes: dormancy is lethal. It’s also tough on students and emerging artists, cast into a punishing job market with few professional opportunities. How many can stick it out? Are we in danger of losing our next generation of talent? And given closed borders and post-Brexit visas, one might worry that Rojo’s “renaissance” will be too UK-focused. Dance is such a collaborative form, led by international choreographers. Nixon is cautious: “We have fantastic British dancers in the company, but lots from other countries too. You don’t grow in isolation – you need to be fed by what’s out there.” But if anything, he believes, Brexit “will push us even more to collaborate and reach across borders”. After all, dance is a universal language. Rojo agrees: “Anybody can look at it and feel something.” In her view, we should take pride in the fact that British companies are in such demand all over the world – something that isn’t going to change. One positive consequence of the pandemic has been a lasting change at the political level: this artform – so often overlooked – is now firmly on the agenda. Rojo thinks of her position at ENB as “an honour and a great responsibility. Speaking out for the arts, lobbying the Government – it’s given me more conviction.” She now advocates the introduction of a living wage and better job security. With dance taking its rightful place centre-stage, the prospects really are exciting. “We’ve sustained everyone through lockdown,” says Rojo. “We drive the recovery of other sectors, and we help give the UK its identity. “We know how many doors the arts can open. That’s going to be more important than ever.”",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/westeros-west-end-game-thrones-spin-offs-need-stop/,culture,"This year will mark a melancholy anniversary for fans of incestuous twins and dragons with hot and heavy mother issues. Summer 2016 was the last time   was any good. It was the season of Battle of the Bastards and of Cersei Lannister blowing up Margaery Tyrell and half of King’s Landing with explosive green goo. After the explosive green goo and Jon Snow v Ramsay Bolton it was a quick slalom downhill to one of the worst finales in television history.  Half a decade later does anyone still care about Game of Thrones? Or have we all moved on to the latest whiz-bang Marvel and Disney property? That is the multi-million dollar question upon which American network HBO (and UK partner Sky Atlantic) is making the Mother of Gambles.  Game of Thrones is about to undergo a Marvel-eseque spurt of exponential expansion. With one GoT prequel series already underway, HBO has now announced a further five – including an animated spin-off and something called the “ ” (also the name of a quiz concept Noel Edmonds tried flogging to Channel 4 in 1997). And that’s just the start. Just this week, Game of Thrones author George RR Martin announced plans for a Broadway play. The project is to be based on a story by Martin working with playwright Duncan MacMillan and director Dominic Cooke. Inevitably it is yet another prequel – time flows only one way in Westeros apparently – and is to be centred on the fateful Great Tourney at Harrenhal, just 16 years before GoT season one.  The big idea, it seems, is to bring back fan favourites Lord Eddard Stark and future King Robert Baratheon. Now obviously in a fair and just world, the play would be a musical and there would be a song in which Lord Stark sings “My name is Ned / whoops, what happened to my head?”  Alas, it is more likely to be just another serving of Martin’s patented “grimdark” fantasy, in which everyone is uncouth,  and drops the c-word as if it is going out of fashion. And, as it happens, dropping the c-word in fantasy IS going out of fashion. The genre has moved on from George RR Martin’s gloomy vision – what if Lord of the Rings only bleak? – to something more expansive. You can see the shift in the writings of Brandon Sanderson, heir to Martin in terms of sales and cultural clout. His books are epic and ambitious – but there is no gratuitous sexual violence or “stunt incest”. Plus, when he starts a multi-volume doorstopper series he makes sure to finish it. And if fantasy fans have moved on from Martin, rest assured the wider public has done likewise. It’s less than two years since Game of Thrones fizzled out with one of the sorriest final seasons in the annals of TV. Almost immediately, the show seemed pull off the daring trick of erasing its own cultural legacy. Remember when coffee shops would give you a free mochaccino if you ordered in fluent High Valyrian? Or when Primark was flogging House Baratheon-themed PJs? It feels like a fever dream doesn’t it? What were we all thinking? Were we thinking at all? What HBO and Martin are thinking is that there is an untapped reservoir of Game of Thrones fandom to exploit. Hence plans for House of the Dragon, starring Olivia Cooke, Emma D’Arcy, Paddy Considine and Matt Smith and set 300 years before Game of Thrones. That show is presently filming in England and is due to debut in 2022. Further down the pipeline is the slate of newly-announced projects. These include a telling of the story of warrior queen “Nymeria” – a “revered figure of House Martell”. There is also 9 Voyages, a maritime caper from Rome creator Bruno Heller, and Flea Bottom, a gritty urban series set in the slums of King’s Landing. Plus Dunk and Egg, based on a trilogy of Martin novellas, and the new animated show.  The irony around all this is that the longer Martin spends working with HBO – he has just signed a huge overall contract with HBO Max – the less time he will presumably be able to devote to finishing the final two novels in A Song of Ice and Fire. Game of Thrones is, after all, just one prong of his HBO Max deal. There will also be a series based off his Wild Cards superhero anthologies and one adapted from his In the Lost Lands adventure stories (weirdly there is no room for an adaptation of his best novel, Fevre Dream). He’s also launched an “immersive entertainment company” Meow Wolf, which has already unveiled “mind bending” attractions in New Mexico and Las Vegas.  The impression one gets is that Martin isn’t all that invested in the actual Game of Thrones story – which he began in the early Nineties and shows little inclination of finishing. And if he can’t be bothered, why should the public feel any differently? It isn’t as if fantasy fans are in danger of being left in the lurch. In April Netflix will unveil its blockbuster adaptation of Leigh Bardugo’s Shadow and Bone series.  Meanwhile, Amazon is assembling both a Lord of the Rings prequel and a small screen version of Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time – a saga which, in scope and political complexity, served as a huge inspiration for Martin. Before HBO gets around to unleashing its deluge of fresh Westeros content it may find the fantasy TV throne already occupied. And by the time Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon start duetting on Broadway the show may well and truly be over. If HBO and George RR Martin think this has a happy ending, they probably haven’t been paying attention. ",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/disney-has-death-nile-dilemma-thanks-disgraced-armie-hammer/,culture,"It’s a dilemma that not even   and his little grey cells can solve: what to do about the latest movie version of  ’s Death on the Nile, which features disgraced actor  ?  Directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also stars as the iconic moustachioed detective (Branagh reprising the role from 2017’s Murder on the Orient Express), the Egypt-set film has an all-star cast, including Gal Gadot, Rose Leslie, Sophie Okonedo, Letitia Wright, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, Annette Bening, Emma Mackey, Ali Fazal and Russell Brand. Although   received decidedly mixed reviews from critics, it grossed a healthy $351 million worldwide - and its follow-up could well follow suit, with Branagh talking confidently about creating a new “cinematic universe” of Christie films. However, the fate of this latest outing looks uncertain. Originally scheduled to be released in December 2019, it was juggled around the calendar due to Covid, and then removed from schedules altogether. The film finally got a new release date of September 17 2021, but in last week’s announcement from Disney, it was shunted - for the 6th time - to February 2022 instead. That pushes the problem further down the road, but does nothing to solve it. Hammer plays the key role of Simon Doyle in the film - whose part in a dramatic love triangle sets the murderous events in motion - so can’t simply be excised. But serious allegations have been made against Hammer, with Los Angeles police opening an investigation into an   that he raped a young woman four years ago, which Hammer denies. There have also been unsubstantiated accusations about his aberrant sexual behaviour circulating on social media for months, and Hammer is in the midst of a public divorce and custody battle with his estranged wife Elizabeth Chambers. Yesterday it was announced that Hammer   from Cold War thriller Billionaire Dollar Spy, while back in January, the actor pulled out of movie Shotgun Wedding, in which he was due to star with Jennifer Lopez. There are no other upcoming projects confirmed with Hammer, other than those that wrapped prior to the allegations - such as Death on the Nile. There has been no further mention of the possible   sequel.  What, then, can Disney do with their tainted Poirot project? If there really are ambitions to make this a franchise, it’s even more of a commercial headache - and Hammer’s presence could well sink it entirely. The company inherited the film when it acquired 20th Century Fox. Simply recasting Hammer, as Ridley Scott did in his Kevin Spacey-starring All the Money in the World, seems unlikely without major and costly reshoots. But neither could Disney begin a press tour in which Hammer’s co-stars would likely be faced with a barrage of difficult questions. According to  , a source familiar with an early cut of Death on the Nile reported that Hammer’s role is significant to the point of being the film’s male lead. However, another insider claims that the studio is not currently considering either reshooting or recasting. The former could run to tens of millions, and also be logistically challenging given the cast’s busy schedules. A rival studio executive told Variety: “It seems like the only way to go with this is to come out front and say, ‘Hundreds of people worked on this project, and we’re not scrapping it because of one individual.’” That executive speculated that the film could wind up being released on a streaming service instead of having a theatrical release. Still, with the delay to February - at least - we will have to wait a while for the denouement in this case. As Poirot said, “I reserve the explanations for the last chapter.”",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/next-opera-classical-music-digital-concerts-intergenerational/,culture,"Classical music and opera in Britain have faced crises before – two world wars, plagues, government bans during the Cromwellian period – but never anything as bad as  . And yet, long before the pandemic struck, these ancient and inherently traditional artforms were already in difficulties. Both suffer from aging and shrinking audiences, and a cultural and political climate increasingly hostile to “elitism”. In response, they’ve been taking steps to renovate themselves. “Diversity” and “accessibility” are now the keywords, aims which are sometimes hard to square with other values – the need to preserve a core repertoire of masterpieces, for example, or to produce radical and “challenging” art. The early signs are that the pandemic has accelerated existing trends, perhaps beyond the point of no return. With venues closed, and income streams from live audiences cut off, institutions have been forced to be innovative. Many have embraced the challenge of   live and pre-recorded concerts, though the economics of this are dubious; with ticket prices pitched between £7 and £12, the income stream is modest compared to ticketed live concerts. Nonetheless, digital performances are here to stay. Dougie Scarfe, chief executive of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, says the vital thing has been to stay visible. “We wanted to say to our audience: ‘We are here for you.’ And we wanted to get back to employing musicians as well. So we built our stage to allow 50 musicians to play with social distancing, and we put on a complete season of digital concerts. I think the pandemic has accelerated our move into the digital sphere by about five years.” Jenny Jamison, chief executive of the Scottish Ensemble, had to cope with even stricter lockdown conditions than those imposed in England. “We could only do outdoor concerts, and even those were cancelled. This encouraged us to move into digital presentation, which we’d been thinking about for a while but never had a quiet moment to work on. We worked with two production companies, because I believe it has to be a different sort of experience than just reproducing a concert. We also had to move all our education work online, and by doing that we reached 150 schools, which is many more than we could ever reach in person.” Still, when you ask whether their changes will be permanent, the “yes” is always followed by a “but”. The insistence on the importance of the live event is a mantra one hears again and again. “I love the spontaneity that comes from working on really short time-frames, which the pandemic necessitated,” Jamison says, “and it would be a mistake to lose the new skills we’ve acquired. But nothing can replace the live event.” But what will those live events involve? Will institutions need to be more cautious in their programming, to win back their traditional audiences? Jamison says no, but in Bournemouth, Scarfe is more circumspect. He’s keenly aware that other values are at play. “I’ve had letters from audience members saying that just seeing the BSO on stage on their screens every Wednesday gives them a comforting feeling of normality. But of course the social dimension is missing. I really want to get out on tour again, because our concerts are a social experience as much as a musical one.” When I ask whether the orchestra will have to be more local in its choice of invited artists, as a consequence of both the pandemic and Brexit, the answer is “no, but”. “We are an international business,” he says, “and we want to draw on the widest pool of talent. But it’s true there is an administrative burden of extra red tape, and extra costs for touring projects.” In the  , one finds the same tension between wanting to capitalise on the new ideas thrown up by the pandemic, while hanging onto a core artistic mission. Some companies have been really bold, none more so than English Touring Opera. It has made a filmed version of the St John Passion involving amateur choirs from all over the UK, and a series of filmed small-scale performances called Lyric Solitudes, which are bold dramatisations of song cycles. James Conway, ETO’s director, is enthused by the idea that opera will become more local in terms of both performing talent and artistic identity. “I really dislike these touring international co-productions, where the same production turns up in six different cities. For me, it’s the operatic equivalent of the airport duty-free shop’s luxury brands.” Will the digital aspect of ETO’s work continue? “Absolutely, but as a supplement, rather than displacing live performance. For me, that offers something irreplaceable.” The company has taken a big financial hit, but when I ask whether recovering from that will necessitate a more cautious programming policy in the future, he’s adamant. “No way. It’s an illusion that that’s a safe way forward, because there is no safe. If we just present La Traviata and Madama Butterfly all the time, it’s nothing more than a temporary fix. In the end it will be the death of the art form.” That’s the view of a small, nimble-on-its-feet touring opera company. You’d expect a flagship company like the Royal Opera, however, to be more cautious about artistic policy in the future, given the sheer size of the organisation, and the cultural role it’s expected to fulfil. When I ask chief executive Alex Beard whether the new mantra of “make it local” could apply at Covent Garden, he’s as circumspect as Dougie Scarfe in Bournemouth. “Up to a point, but I think here there will be always an expectation to see the very greatest artists in the flesh.” Meaning: we’re still willing to pay top dollar for Jonas Kaufmann and Anna Netrebko. With only 20 per cent of the company’s income coming from subsidy it’s taken a terrible financial hit, and has had to resort to redundancies and selling off assets including a David Hockney painting. Are there any silver linings? “My feeling is this pandemic has brought the arts community together in a way that’s never happened before. For example, every Friday morning there’s a Zoom meeting where dozens of people who run arts organisations meet up to share ideas. That would never have happened before the pandemic.” What is difficult to predict is how the deeper currents of values and meanings expressed in these traditional artforms will change. Will there be a huge upsurge in love for the core classics, as audiences crave comfort and security? Or will the move to new technologies breed radically new forms? In my opinion, and to judge by what I hear, it will be both at once: the fragmentation that’s already visible is going to accelerate in the coming years. A once-unified field could end up divided along different demographic divides: over here, “chill-out” or “healing” classics for younger audiences, in clubs or community centres; over there, defiantly traditional concerts and operas for older ones, in traditional venues. These divisions are more than demographic: they’re rooted in very different conceptions of what the words “classical” and “opera” actually mean. The struggle over who “owns” these artforms may become the defining feature of the post-pandemic age.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/next-pop-rock-live-music-boom-fight-industrys-soul/,culture,"Covid-19 exposed fault lines in the popular music business. As the live sector ground to an economically devastating halt, one that threatened to destroy livelihoods, the recorded music sector enjoyed a streaming boom that patently failed to benefit the vast majority of music makers. One side appeared to be rolling in wealth as it threw, via social media, a year-long lockdown dance party for homebound consumers, while the other side was queuing up at food banks and railing against a fundamental, systemic imbalance of remuneration between creators and monetisers. This may be an age-old tension, but the effects of the pandemic brought new pressures to bear: it threw economic disparities into sharp relief and raised questions about whether the very structure of the music business was fit for the modern world.  As the immediate crisis passes, venue doors creak nervously open, underemployed musicians tune up their instruments, road crews pick up tools again, and fans get their glad rags and dancing shoes on, the big question is: has anything really changed? Is the music industry ready to address the deep inequities that have come to light during this long, strange year, or will everyone be so relieved just to be back on the beat that we’ll dance our troubles away, and hope for the best? In a few months’ time,  , sitting in theatres, or leaning against bars being bombarded by sound and lights and music (sweet music!). It should start with small venues opening at the end of May, followed by some big outdoor events as the summer heats up. A few brave (or foolhardy) festivals are determined to press ahead in August,   against the potential losses were a new strain of Covid to blow everything off course. By the fourth quarter, arenas should be booming to the sounds of the world’s greatest rock and pop stars, some desperate to replenish their coffers, others just desperate to strut their stuff again. There could yet be setbacks and delays. We may have to show vaccination passports at the doors to gain admission. I don’t expect venues to be as jam-packed as in days of yore. Caution and social distancing will remain priorities for many, and for some time to come. Of course, others will be ramming themselves into the heart of spontaneous mosh pits with devil-may-care abandon as soon as they’re allowed – or even if they’re not.  The appetite for young people (in particular) to get back into the fray has been demonstrated by the number of illegal raves breaking out during the past year, and once that party really gets started, it’s going to go off in all kinds of unpredictable ways. But across all age groups, there has been a patient acceptance of postponements (with low levels of concert ticket returns, as 87 per cent held on to purchases), alongside a healthy surge in sales since the Government announced its roadmap to recovery. Britain is not just ready to rock – it’s desperate to do so. A live boom is on its way. By 2022, there will be so many popular musicians on the road that revellers will be spoilt for choice. Live Nation, arguably the world’s largest events-promotion conglomerate, expects to have 45 major artists touring, when it would usually field half of that. The company lost 84 per cent of its revenue in 2020, but is planning for 2021 to be its busiest year, with Britain’s advanced vaccination programme putting us in the vanguard. “On a global basis, the show will be back,” according to CEO Michael Rapino. “It’ll be back as big as ever, [thanks to] consumer demand.” This is good news for fans, and a lifesaver for musicians. One thing that lockdown has made savagely clear is that live performance is the key income stream for the majority of working musicians. Time and again, we have heard tales of penury and hardship, even from household names. David Crosby, a world-famous American singer-songwriter and founding member of two beloved bands (folk rockers The Byrds and harmonising quartet Crosby Stills Nash and Young) sold off the rights to his entire catalogue last month, declaring “I can’t work, and streaming stole my money.” His music was bought by Iconic Artists, one of a new breed of aggressively acquisitive music focused investment funds much in the news. Market leaders    , Blondie, Nile Rodgers and Barry Manilow;  , meanwhile, sold his catalogue to Universal for over $300 million. By treating copyrights as long-term investments, such funds present themselves as artists’ champions, but others view them as asset-strippers exploiting the inequities of the current rights system. It’s a trend sure to gain further momentum over the coming months, as more big names take a pay-day, but one that only benefits established artists while contributing nothing to the long-term creative future of music. The online #BrokenRecords campaign started by Tom Gray, a member of British indie rockers Gomez, has gained significant traction by highlighting the microscopic royalty payments that streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube (owned by Google) pay to rights holders. Musicians and songwriters complained of being at the bottom of a digital food chain, receiving fractions of a penny for each song, with even those tiny dividends effectively being divided between multiple band members and songwriters after record companies have made all kinds of contractual deductions. At the heart of the controversy were complaints about a “winner takes all” system, based on market share, that only delivered substantial payments to superstars and supersized record labels; 78 per cent of Spotify’s royalties are paid to major labels and the major independent rights body Merlin. It caused enough of a stink to inspire a British parliamentary inquiry into the economics of streaming. The heads of record companies and streaming platforms queued up to declare that it was a perfectly fair and equitable system, and it wasn’t their fault if artists had negotiated such poor deals for themselves (I’m paraphrasing). They came across as mean-spirited and obstructive when confronted with the emotional testimony of members of   and Elbow, who spoke passionately on behalf of impoverished musicians and unemployed crew members. The critically-acclaimed, Mercury Prize-nominated, festival-headlining indie singer-songwriter Nadine Shah revealed that she’d had to move back in with her parents during lockdown because she could no longer pay her rent. To industry protests that the streaming system was perfectly transparent, Shah retorted: “What is transparent is that I am not being paid.” The truth is that this fight has been brewing for a decade. Streaming has replaced CDs, vinyl and even downloads as the mass-market distribution method of the digital online era. No one disputes that it is convenient and effective, with consumers paying monthly fees (or enduring the irritation of free advertising-supported models) to receive unlimited access to pretty much anything we want to listen to, all beamed directly to our devices. After more than a decade of decline, streaming has restored the recorded-music industry’s fortunes, and returned it to healthy growth, with a global streaming market estimated to be worth $26 billion in 2019. The pandemic thus accelerated existing trends, with everyone stuck at home eager for entertainment to while away the endless hours. The Record Industry of Association of America noted a 14.6 per cent growth in on-demand music services during the last year. Spotify alone added a billion euros’ worth of premium revenue as subscriptions boomed. Major labels are said to earn as much as $20 million a day from streaming.  But as Covid devastated the live industry, what became cruelly clear is that streaming’s trickle-down economics are not trickling down to the people who actually make the music. There are over 8 million artists touting their wares on Spotify, but just 7,500 earned $100,000 in 2020. That is just 0.09 per cent of musicians on Spotify, meaning: pretty much every recording musician in the world. And even that dismal figure is misleading, because it doesn’t account for profit division among bands and fellow rights-holders. “Streaming has been built by corporations for profit margins. It hasn’t been built with any sustainable cultural remit in mind,” is the view of Tom Gray, who argues that this is a historic opportunity for fans, players and industry alike to right some systemic wrongs. “It’s about collectively saying: we all recognise that this is problematic. We all recognise that this was never really right, and surely we’re all bright enough and dynamic enough and willing enough to do something about it.” What is emerging is a powerful grassroots argument for higher royalty rates, fairer record and publishing contracts reflecting new digital-distribution realities, and a user-centric payment system that connects listener’s fees directly with their favourite artists, rather than dispersing profits on the blunter market-share system. The latter is something we will be hearing a lot about in the coming year, as SoundCloud (a relatively small but significant streaming service) announced its adoption of what is being described as “fan-powered royalties”.  Some really big stars are getting involved here, lending a moral dimension to the campaign, since they are objecting to a system that has personally enriched them. “I want my (streaming) subscription to go to the people I play,”   of Abba insisted during the recent Radio 4 Front Row programme, The Price of Song. “With user-centric, you could be a niche artist with 3,000 loyal followers, and if they play you, you get all their subscriptions, which means you could actually live off that. But as it is now, it all goes to those mega artists who have billions of clicks. And that is one thing we could change. It’s completely unfair.” I expect this to become an ever more public battle over the next year, a struggle for the soul of the music industry. One possible consequence will be to greatly energise and empower a genuinely independent movement, where creators opt to retain all their own rights, supported by breakaway streaming platforms and a more artist-friendly network of independent music services. The major labels, with their huge budgets and global marketing reach, may continue to dominate the mass market, but it has been striking how many genuinely independent British artists reaped the benefits of loyal fanbases this past year. There were big chart-topping hit albums during lockdown for such fierce rock bands as Idles,  ,   and Architects, and uncompromising grime artists ,   and  .  When venues throw their doors open, who are those all-important young audiences going to be most desperate to see? Someone with a cute viral hit from an algorithmically-driven Spotify playlist – or the kind of artists who have struck deep bonds with fanbases through bloody-minded commitment to their art? If you add the kind of bold creative energy we see in the independent sector to a fan- and artist-driven campaign for change, then put it together with a revitalised live scene driven by the pent-up frustration of a young audience desperate for visceral thrills and human connection, it unlocks all kinds of thrilling possibilities. And this is my fondest hope for the future, that something will emerge that no one could have predicted: a new scene, a new style, a new attitude, a new way of doing business rather than a return to business as usual. There will be plenty of the latter, of course. What I can say with certainty is that there will be a dam-burst of new albums from all our favourite established stars in the next 18 months, and celebratory gigs from the biggest name in every popular musical genre. It’s going to be a good year ahead for music, wherever your tastes lie. But I’m also looking nervously and hopefully at the horizon for something fresh, something youthful, challenging and radical that might push music out of its comfort zone, scare the horses, rattle established practises, rewrite the rules, and shake the whole business to its foundations, whether we like it or not. Maybe it’s just a dream, one of those feverishly over-stimulated pandemic visions that have haunted so many of us this past 12 months. But wouldn’t it be satisfying if the end of lockdown offered pop music a whole new beginning?",0

The latter has programmed a new play by Buffini to form part of an ambitious slew of work that will reopen the theatre (in north London). That season (which will launch from May 21) contains some major excitements, including an adaptation by Zadie Smith of  ’s The Wife of Bath’s tale (“The Wife of Willesden). Buffini’s contribution, Dance Floor, is her most personal work to date, centring as it does on the Irish immigrant experience in London when the welcome was not always warm. “My parents met in a dance-hall. He was from Dublin, she from Donegal. He asked her to marry him the first night they met. She laughed at him but then they did.” Buffini grew up in Cheshire, and trained to become an actor, before yielding to her vocation. And although her work is hard to pigeon-hole, one can trace a recurrent fascination with questions about the individual and society. “I’m interested in power,” she says. “Who has got it and who hasn’t. I think my little Irish play is about people who haven’t got power. And Harlots was entirely about what you do, and how you survive, in a system stacked against you.” The most commercially successful example of this fascination was  , her play about the Queen’s meetings with Margaret Thatcher, which was conceived (and trialled) prior to Peter Morgan’s ( -begetting)  . It was directed by Rubasingham at the Kiln (when it was the Tricycle), before going to the West End. A decade on from Mrs T’s death, it remains the best play yet written about her. “I wasn’t interested in all those male PMs,” she laughs. Rare is the play that makes a strong commercial return. Tougher than ever, owing to the pandemic, is the life of a playwright. Is it not the case that the growth of Netflix has proved a boon to her and those in her profession? Her retort is lightning fast. “I’d turn that round and say that playwrights are a really good thing for Netflix. Netflix needs us. All those big channels need to invest in British theatre, because we can author big blockbuster series. Because we have been trained in the theatre, we know how to write scenes of scale, and we know how to deepen characters. We are confident authors. We are a   good thing for Netflix!”",1

A necromantic tract bound in human vellum? Passé. A telescope filled with the rotting ichor of hanged men? Yawn. How about a  , with a drop of human blood in their soles? Now we’re talking.  That last one isn’t sub-MR James fan fiction. In fact, it’s the latest wheeze of viral marketers-cum-professional-provocateurs, MSCHF. Their advertising campaign for the devilish sneakers – fronted by the  , whose 2019 single Old Town Road stormed the charts – has stirred a predictable dust-cloud of controversy. It has also had the distinction of uniting Right-wing Christians and global brands in condemnation.  South Dakota’s Republican governor Kristi Noem wrote on Twitter: “Our kids are being told that this kind of product is, not only okay, it’s ‘exclusive’. But do you know what’s more exclusive? Their God-given eternal soul.” And Nike failed to see the stunt’s amusing side: they are suing MSCHF for a breach of trademark.  The $1,018 (£740) trainers – limited, naturally, to 666 pairs – sold out in less than a minute when they were released on Monday. But are MSCHF’s actions an acute Baudrillardian commentary on the intersection of internet culture, social-media outrage and art? Or is it just trite agit-pop, as the group’s disdain for vowels may suggest?  “I think it’s one of the best marketing executions I’ve seen,” says Madison Campbell, CEO of Leda Health and expert on start-up culture. “I think it absolutely cuts through. Look at the stir and the noise it’s created. [Lil Nas X’s] followers and customers believe in the authenticity of what he’s selling. That’s him – love it or leave it, he’s not changing. “And I’m assuming not too many Christians buy shoes from him, so maybe it’s not a huge loss.”  MSCHF has form with these kinds of stunts. In October 2019, they marketed a pair of “Jesus Shoes” – again a customised pair of Nike Air Max 97s whose soles contained a vial of water from the River Jordan blessed by a priest – which were priced at $1,425 and were one of the most searched-for shoes that year. Their previous pranks include an app that recommends stock investments based on your astrological sign, a browser plug-in that disguises Netflix watching as a Zoom call, and a rubber-chicken bong.  Some of their “drops” – released via a cryptic website and text messages that spark endless threads on Reddit – have a sharper political edge. Their website Zuckwatch, a password-protected site that looks like Facebook, was a smuggled critique of online privacy. And in 2020, Blue Monkey, a shell restaurant they founded, was shut down within hours. (It transpired that diners who thought they were placing food orders were in fact donating to insurgent political candidates.) Run from a graffiti-clad warehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, MSCHF is fuelled by “structured chaos,” according to its 31-year-old CEO, Gabriel Whaley. “My mom thinks we make toys,” he told the New York Times.  The startup, despite raising at least $11.5 million in venture capital since late 2019, studiously eschews corporate trappings. Founded in 2016 by West Point-dropout Whaley, its walls are plastered with mocked-up film posters with employees’ faces Photoshopped into them, and team meetings are held in a giant white pentagram stencilled on the floor. As of 2020, MSCHF had 10 employees, all in their 20s or early 30s. Only one is a woman.  “Being a company kills the magic,” Whaley told Business Insider recently. “We’re trying to do stuff that the world can’t even define. Our perspective is everything is funny in a nihilistic sort of way. We’re not here to make the world a better place. We’re making light of how much everything sucks.” Is the outfit, with its bong-hit zaniness and stick-it-to-the-man posturing, the final death throes of tech-bro culture? Campbell thinks not. She sees their nose-tweaking stunts as illustrative of how millennial stars such as Lil Nas X and Billie Eilish have used social media to market their identity. Taking part in viral stunts is an astute way to control their public image – and sell records.  “We know rappers, singers, and songwriters count on several revenue streams which give them more control, revenue and equity,” she explains. “If we really knew the breakdown of Kayne West’s clothing line versus his music, what would we see? As a black queer artist, Lil Nas X's existence and visibility in most spaces is an act of resistance in a country deeply divided on the importance and equality of black lives and queerness.”   For his part, Lil Nas X has treated the controversy with evident relish. A few days before the Satan Shoes “drop”, he debuted a new single Montero (Call Me By Your Name). It begins: “In life we hide the parts of ourselves we don’t want others to see/ But here, we don’t."" The accompanying music video is cartoonishly provocative. In it, the rapper slides down a stripper’s pole to Hell and gives a lap-dance to the Devil, before snapping his neck and assuming his horns. Lil Nas X's response to the online furore has been equally laconic – he tweeted a SpongeBob SquarePants meme.   Guerilla marketing is nothing new. As detailed by Ryan Holiday in Trust Me, I’m Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator, ‘viral’ happenings are often as artfully orchestrated as conventional, starchy press releases. Ikea has used Banksy-style street art to promote its brand, and drink-driving public-awareness campaigns have sprayed parking spaces around trees – “reserved from drunk drivers” – to highlight its dangerous consequences.  It can be taken further: Peter Jackson’s 2005 King Kong remake was advertised with gigantic banana-skins left scattered on rooftops, and Hot Wheels has transformed overpasses with apparent loop-the-loops. Indeed, artists such as Jeff Koons have long probed the boundaries between kitsch, commerciality and reproducibility. Andy Warhol’s endlessly replicated Campbell’s Soup print is an arguable forerunner of MSCHF’s Satan Shoes.  Yet while contemporary critics may have sniffed at Warhol's work, he never set out to offend. On the other hand, offence is the whole point in the case of MSCHF and Lil Nas X's collaboration. It is, after all, the one currency the internet truly recognises.  “What [they’re doing] is very interesting,” says Chris Moos, lecturer in organisational studies at Oxford’s Saïd Business School. ""They are purposefully choosing to alienate one part of the community over another, and playing their sensibilities off against each other. There’s a growing number of young Americans who are not religious, and these shoes are a way of going against ideologies which have been imposed upon them in the past.”  In fact, Moos argues, the “product” MSCHF are selling is not the sneakers themselves. Rather, it is the great bow-wave of internet outrage and hype they have generated. It’s a trend that is increasingly common in the art market, he says. A purely digital collage by the artist Beeple, for instance,  , recently sold at auction for a record-breaking $69.3 million.  “We think of art as something physical, an artefact we can touch and see,” Moos explains. “But in the digital age, we create artefacts that aren’t necessarily physical. And there will be a growing market for purely digital cultural products.” Nonetheless, MSCHF’s all-too-real gag looks like it will land them in hot water. Some customers have called for boycotts of Nike products because of their apparent association with Satanism. That potential loss of income and reputational tarnish is something of which the company will take a dim view, as the intellectual property attorney Zachary Silbersher told Vice. “[They want] to send a message to everybody else that if you use that Nike ‘swoosh’ or its trademarks in a way that they don’t like, they’re going to come after you, and they’re going to be very aggressive about it. They’ll marshal all of the resources they have, and they probably have a lot more resources than you do.”  A telephone conference for that case has been set for June 29. MSCHF’s scrappy stand against corporate power looks set for an appropriately Biblical reckoning.",1

Custom House – a Grade I listed Georgian building that dominates the north bank of the Thames in central London – is set to be converted by Guernsey-based  , which bought the freeholds and historic leaseholds of 132 HMRC offices for £370m in 2001 in a 20-year private finance initiative deal. The development is likely to reignite controversy over the original deal, signed when Tony Blair was prime minister. There was fury when it emerged the property portfolio had been transferred to Bermuda. A sale and leaseback agreement under which Mapeley provided serviced government offices means HMRC has since paid the firm more than £3.5bn. Mapeley is also facing questions about the details of its proposal for Custom House, for which the firm agreed a 175-year lease at a peppercorn rent. The application, which is due to come before a City of London Corporation committee later this year, sets out plans to convert the neo-classical building into a 204-bedroom hotel with two rooftop pavilions. The historic 180ft Long Room where officials once processed paperwork for customs duties will be refurbished. Conservation charity the Georgian Group opposes the plans and said they would harm the significance of the building. Mapeley subsidiary Cannon Capital Developments has devised other ambitious property developments in former government offices across the country, including in Edinburgh, Manchester, Leicester, Milton Keynes and Swansea.

The Asphalt Industry Alliance (AIA) said wait time between re-tarmacing had risen from an average of 76 years in England recorded the year before, due to a drop in works on main roads. The findings come after the Government announced an extra £500 million funding for councils as part of a drive to  . Ministers said the money would fill in the equivalent of 10 million potholes across the country.  The AIA’s latest road maintenance survey found local authorities’ repair budget had increased over the past year by 15 per cent to an average of £23 million per area. However, it also found there was still a £752 million shortfall between the total budgets across England and Wales and the works waiting to be done. The average shortfall was £4.6 million for councils in England (not including London), £4.5 million in London and £3.8 million in Wales. The AIA report estimated that the full repair bill for the country’s roads now stands at £10.4 billion and it would take a decade to clear the backlog. It also found large discrepancies in the average waiting times between roads being resurfaced, with it now at 68 years across the country and breaking down as 83 years in England, 31 in London and 46 in Wales. The AIA called on the Government to increase funding to wider road maintenance rather than focusing solely on fixing individual potholes. Rick Green, chair of the AIA, said: “While the extra funding in 2020/21 was welcomed, using it to repeatedly fill in potholes is essentially a failure as it does nothing to improve the resilience of the network.  “The average frequency of road surfacing is now once every 68 years and the bill to fix the backlog of maintenance work on our local roads in England and Wales remains in excess of £10 billion.” Nicholas Lyes, RAC head of roads policy, added: “Potholes are a nuisance and not only cause expensive vehicle damage but can also lead to serious injury or even worse. Without a long-term approach to local road maintenance funding, similar to what we already have for strategic roads, we face our roads remaining in a perpetually poor state.” The resurfacing data came from a detailed annual survey the AIA carries out with the 167 local councils in England and Wales about the state of road repairs. The report found in England that arterial and main roads were resurfaced far more frequently than residential roads, with the former being resurfaced every 36 years on average and the latter every 105 years.    ",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/proposal-threatening-condemn-londons-homes-darkness/,business,"After a year of rolling lockdowns and shuttered offices, light and airy housing has never been more important to Britain’s legions of city dwellers. Alongside the old staples of a lively local high street, good pub and short commute, a new box has been added to typical home-hunter’s checklist – how much sun their property lets in. But the demand for natural light is threatening to put occupiers at odds with developers at a time when space is at a premium and   is seen as essential to solve the country’s housing crisis. In London, a consultation launched by mayor Sadiq Khan includes a possible reduction in a key measure of how much light builders must allow into their properties, the so-called vertical sky component. “There’s a bit of a battle going on,” says lighting consultant Paul Littlefair. “Obviously, you have developers who want to build bigger and bigger and have buildings that restrict more light. And obviously from a point of view of providing housing in London, you need all this extra housing. “But on the other hand, [you have] existing residents who need daylight and want to retain the daylight they currently have.” The vertical sky component calculates the angle of light entering through a window and is meant to prevent dingy houses from getting built. It is part of planning code and must be taken into account by developers along with other environmental measures. Campaigners argue the changes proposed in the consultation could condemn thousands of families to perpetual semi-darkness. They say that the changes will significantly cut how much light enters individual rooms and point out that being cut off from the sun can harm occupiers’ physical and mental health. “The links between daylight and both physical and mental health are very well established,” says planning activist George Turner. “After a year of being locked down in our homes, I think we can all appreciate the importance of having access to adequate daylight. “Daylight standards do not stop new development, they stop bad development. There is no reason why competent architects can’t design new buildings that protect the living conditions of neighbours.” The row over daylight is already causing a headache for ministers. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick is poised to rule on a £500m project at 8 Albert Embankment, a London Fire Brigade site being developed into 443 homes which builder U+I says will create 1,200 new jobs. Researchers at the Building Research Establishment (BRE) have warned that 424 properties would fall below its recommended daylight standards as new buildings cut off the views from existing ones, including accommodation for disabled people in the ground floor of a nearby block of flats, and Turner is leading a bid to protect neighbours’ rights. A spokesman for U+I defended the development, saying the benefits outweighed the costs. He said: “As with all tall buildings in central London there will always be some impact, particularly in areas like this where local and regional planning policy supports high density development. “With a slender diamond shaped form, the taller elements of our proposals have been specifically designed to minimise any impact on neighbouring properties, and as a result the level of daylight retained would be considered normal in other central London areas. “This ultimately needs to be balanced against the huge number of public benefits that this scheme will deliver, including a modern new fire station [and] a permanent home for the London Fire Brigade Museum. More than 40pc of the properties being built will be affordable, the spokesman said. Despite the battle coming to a head over Albert Embankment, the debate is not a new one. The BRE has previously raised concerns about a host of other major projects including Wood Wharf on the Isle of Dogs, part of a rejuvenation of an area previously owned by British Waterways. Planning was approved in 2014 by Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London, despite BRE objections during the initial planning stage which found that 993 of 2,153 surrounding windows would fall below BRE thresholds for light levels if it went ahead. Other planned projects in the area had similar issues. Canary Wharf’s Heron Quay West caused 730 individual breaches of the BRE tests, while the proposed Columbus tower left 60pc of surrounding homes to fall below the minimum level for new buildings. Experts such as Littlefair admit there is increasingly a trade-off between protecting existing homes’ access to daylight and solving London’s housing crisis. As businesses across the capital embrace flexible working, that challenge is only going to grow.",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/17/energy-customers-get-automatic-credit-refunds-regulator-plans/,business,"Households would be automatically refunded any overpayments on energy bills in plans tabled by the regulator to end companies using customers’ money incorrectly. Under the current system, those who   by direct debit pay a fixed amount each month, typically overpaying in the summer months when usage is low in order to build up credit which can be drawn on throughout the winter. However, this can lead to companies holding extra cash at the end of the year and Ofgem, the industry regulator, estimated in 2018 that as much as £1.4bn was being held in surplus credit balances. The new process, which is now being consulted on, would mean suppliers would be required to refund any outstanding credit each year on the 12 month anniversary of the account being opened. Some firms already do this, but Ofgem said that in the majority of cases the onus is on the customer to claim back any extra cash. Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, said: “These new proposals would ensure that suppliers are not holding onto more of customers’ money than absolutely necessary, potentially returning millions of pounds of customers’ money.   “This is an important step in making the retail energy market fairer for consumers at a time when many are facing financial hardship.”  Ofgem said it is concerned that some suppliers may use customers' surplus credit balances to fund “otherwise unsustainable business practices”.  These could include relying on cash reserves to offer artificially low tariffs in the hope of quickly gaining new customers, but this comes with a risk that the company will collapse. More than 20 suppliers  , with the regulator appointing a new supplier to take over the supply of the affected customers.  However, the new firm must also take on responsibility for paying outstanding credit and can   from an industry levy. Ofgem said that 79 per cent of funds claimed from this pot were to cover credit balances. If adopted, the new system would come into force next year.  A spokesman for Energy UK, the industry trade body, said: “Paying by direct debit helps customers budget by ensuring they pay a regular amount each month even though their actual energy usage varies significantly over the year.  “Some suppliers already refund credit balances automatically so we now need to look in detail at Ofgem’s proposals.  “We look forward to working with them and our members to find an industry-wide best practice approach that supports customers and works for suppliers.” Peter Earl, head of energy at switching website Comparethemarket.com, said: “Energy companies managing credit balances has long been a matter of confusion and complexity for households.  “Although there is often a focus on customers who are in debt to their supplier, these proposals to return credit balances in a timely manner should be welcomed, especially given the burden the past year has placed on people’s finances.” Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at Uswitch.com, said: “A certain amount of energy credit can be a useful cushion for consumers during the winter months, as it can soften the blow of bills spiking if they are using their heating more at a particular time.  “However, if a customer’s monthly bill is higher than it should be or the consumption is much less than expected, their supplier could be potentially hoarding hundreds of pounds of their money.” He said that, even though the new rules will not come into force until next year, people currently in credit with their supplier may be able to claim a refund.",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cars/comment/france-germany-wrongfoot-uk-hydrogen-fuelled-road-transport/,business,"In the week when the UK Government grudgingly awarded a minuscule grant into   research, Stellantis, the giant European and American car-making group, has revealed a full production hydrogen fuel-cell van which will go on sale in Europe and the UK this year. Stellantis, the Peugeot/Citroen/Opel/Fiat conglomerate, also says that it is investigating using a similar hybridised fuel-cell system in a passenger car, which it will put into production in the near future.  “This is the moment,” says Carla Gohin, Stellantis’s senior vice-president of research and innovation. “We are not talking prototypes, these will be real vehicles for real customers and will be answering specific needs of commercial operators. “We are currently looking at ramping up the project,” she continued, “and it makes sense to look at fitting the next generation [of the technology] into passenger cars, which will be the next step.” The move coincided with an announcement from the French and German transport ministers committing their governments to hydrogen technology and earmarking €7 billion and €5.6 billion respectively into supporting the Stellantis project, improving public demand for fuel cells, developing green hydrogen generation and the provision of a hydrogen refuelling infrastructure in both countries.  France currently has 25 hydrogen filling stations, Germany 90 and the UK 12. This will be an embarrassment for the UK Government, which has claimed that hydrogen is only suitable for marine, heavy commercial and rail technology and seems dead set on  .  Last year’s Department for Transport’s Decarbonising Road Transport consultation paper didn’t even mention hydrogen fuel cells, and   despite the Government’s national infrastructure board saying that the UK needed to plan for hydrogen. The new mid-sized fuel cell van, which will at first be badged as a Peugeot Expert, Citroën Dispatch and Opel Vivaro, will only be available as a left-hand drive vehicle this year, but by 2022 it will also come to the UK as a right-hand-drive Vauxhall Vivaro. Using a heavily hybridised fuel-cell drivetrain, the newcomer will be based on the group’s existing battery vans. The 45kW fuel-cell system sits under the bonnet, a 10.5kWh lithium-ion battery lives across the vehicle under the seats and three tanks holding 4.4 litres of liquid hydrogen at 700 bar are under the load floor. The project is a Franco-German one, which capitalises on the fuel-cell expertise at Opel built up when General Motors owned the company. Its fuel cell unit at Russelheim was handed over to PSA (when it purchased the company in 2017) largely intact; Opel has not made any secret of the fact that the unit’s experienced engineering team was still working on new fuel-cell projects. The new hydrogen van’s range is quoted at 250 miles with a refuelling time of only three minutes. There is no price yet, but Xavier Peugeot, Stellantis’s light commercial senior vice-president, says that it should have a total cost of ownership similar to that of rival conventional vans. He says that although the company has been at the forefront of light commercial electrification, it has identified “a serious percentage of users with operations which are not suitable for electric vehicles”. This is because such users operate a mixed-use cycle, straddling urban and out-of-town use and require a greater range, faster recharging and the retention of the vehicle’s cubic capacity load space.",4

Research by the passenger group Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) found that 88 of 175 stations in the poorest areas of the country have closed since 1960, with 23 areas losing two or more. The findings come as the Government has launched a £500 million project to overseen by the former head of British Railways, Dr Richard Beeching, which led to the closure of more than 2,000 stations.  The report, which studied transport links in 225 deprived areas, warned that the closures had had a particularly devastating impact on coastal and formerly industrial communities, which also suffered from poor bus links and low car ownership. One of the worst affected communities was the Town and Pier area of Dover, which has lost five stations within its boundary over the past five decades. The report, which was produced for the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) for left behind neighbourhoods, said the findings highlighted the  to poorer communities that had become isolated. The Government is currently inviting towns and villages that lost stations in Beeching to apply for grants to build business cases As part of the programme, earlier this year ministers awarded £34 million to begin work re-establishing a passenger line between Newcastle and the mining town of Ashington. Meanwhile, the report by CBT found that the areas with the poorest overall transport links were predominantly on the coast or the outskirts of towns and cities in the North and the Midlands. The study found that 40 percent of households in those areas had no car, compared with just 26 percent across England as a whole. Local authority-supported bus services in those areas had also declined by 35 percent in the past six years. The report found that people living in areas with poor transport links faced greater difficulties accessing jobs, education, healthcare and other essential services. Silviya Barrett, head of policy, research and projects at CBT, said: “The Government must invest in public transport to ensure that no communities are left behind and that we build back better in a way that is fair and sustainable.”",0

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/31/lloyds-london-hit-62bn-covid-bill/,business,"The boss of Lloyd’s of London has dismissed calls to introduce Covid passports for workplaces in a blow to ministers’ hopes of imposing new restrictions on offices.  John Neal, chief executive of the world’s largest insurance market, said proposals that would make office workers   were “unnecessary”.  He said by the time workers return to offices, including Lloyd’s underwriting room, which has capacity for 7,000 people, a significant proportion of the population would be vaccinated and “we'll probably be very close to herd immunity - we think [Covid certificates] are unnecessary”.  It comes as the Government weighs up plans to let employers require proof of vaccination, antibodies, or a recent negative test in a bid to get staff back into offices after more than a year of home working.  Business groups were this week finalising submissions to the Cabinet Office on the topic for a review led by Michael Gove. It is thought industry groups are broadly in favour of the idea, if measures are voluntary and time limited.  Mr Neal also said he expected footfall at the insurance market to return to ""near normal"" levels by September/October, but added that Lloyd’s anticipates underwriters and brokers will return in person as few as three days per week post-pandemic.  ""We’ve done a lot of research with the members of our market – 300 broking firms and 100 insurance firms – and they’re telling us they expect a physical return to work of three-plus days per week. So flexibility yes, but quite a significant physical presence still,"" he said.  The intervention came as Lloyd's said payouts for Covid disruption are set to hit a record £6.2bn for 2020 as it sunk to a £900m annual loss. The group's pre-tax loss compares with profits of £2.5bn for 2019. The pandemic marked its most costly single event on record and sent it tumbling to its worst underwriting result for three years. Lloyd's said that, excluding Covid-19 losses, the 335-year-old market would have posted an underwriting profit of £800m. It added that of the £6.2bn expected in gross payouts linked to the pandemic, £2.6bn was re-insured, limiting the hit. The syndicates that make up the Lloyd's insurance market have been left reeling by the pandemic, and have been forced to pay out on event cancellation, travel, trade credit and business interruption policies due to the virus. Lloyd’s said its combined ratio, a key performance metric for insurance firms, came in at 110.3pc, its worst result since 2017. A combined ratio of more than 100pc suggests that losses and costs exceeded earned premiums, implying that an insurance company has lost money on its operations. Insurers, including many linked to the Lloyd's market, were dealt a blow when the Supreme Court ruled  , though many are still said to be dragging their heels. Mr Neal said: ""We’ve not come out of it very well. At any point where your discussions with your customers results in court action is not ideal. That’s not what any of us want to see… there’s lessons to be learned.""",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/price-hike-day-avoid-licence-fee-rise-increases/,business,"Families across the country face a £6bn increase in the cost of living this Easter, as a raft of price rises come into effect at the start of a new financial year on what has been dubbed national “price hike day”. Bigger bills for council tax, energy, TV licences and much more will cost average households an additional £206 and will mean a 10pc surge in living costs of almost 30 million people, according to comparison site Money.co.uk.  It is a jump that far outstrips the current rate of inflation, which stands at 0.7pc. Some of the increases are unavoidable, but for many there are ways you can beat the rise.  Here is what is changing from April 1 and how you can pay less. Council tax is rising  and by 4.4pc for the typical Band D property, upping costs by £81 on average. Some will pay almost £4,500 for properties in the highest tax bands in areas where local levies are biggest. A third of homes in the middle tax band will pay more than £2,000, up from one in ten the year before.   Council tax is based on property values dating back to the early 1990s. Some have found to be wrong and resulted in refunds for entire streets. In other instances though some have been forced to pay more after querying their tax bands with the state Valuation Office.  Single occupants of homes pay less and students are exempt from the tax. Other exemptions also exist, which the Telegraph’s Tax Hacks columnist Mike Warburton talks about in more detail  .  The cost of watching television is also going up, with the annual cost of a TV licence rising 1pc to £159. Costs have gone up by almost 10pc since 2015 and from 2020 those aged over 75 have been forced to pay, as they no longer receive a licence for free. You do not need a licence if you only ever watch on-demand or catch-up programmes on services other than BBC iPlayer.  can still get a 100pc exemption from the licence fee if they are in receipt of pension credit and this will apply to everyone in the house no matter their age.  Blind people or anyone with “severe sight-impairment” can claim a 50pc discount. Cheaper licences costing £7.50 are available for people living in care or sheltered housing and watching TV in their own room.  The price cap for standard variable tariffs will jump to the equivalent of £1,138 a year for the next six months, the industry watchdog Ofgem has announced. This is a rise of £96 a year. Around 10 million people will face bigger energy bills from this week because of the price rises, worth £1bn, estimates have suggested.  Tom Lyon of the switching website energyhelpline.com said: ""Wholesale energy prices, which account for over half of bills, continue to rise and so we expect that further increases are likely this year. However, the price cap does not affect cheaper, fixed deals, so customers stuck on default tariffs should switch now to lock in lower energy prices for the next 12 months or more."" Water bills are rising to £408 on average, up from £396 last year. Water prices have risen 6pc since 2015. You cannot switch between water providers as the provider you have depends on where you live in the country. But those who pay their bills based on average usage estimates may be able to save by having a water meter installed, particularly if they do not use much water. The Consumer Council for Water, a consumer body, has a free calculator online which estimates how much you could save with a meter, which you can request from your provider. Most providers allow you to trial a meter for up to two years, during which time you can switch back to estimated readings if it turns out they are cheaper. The average cost of prescribed medicines is rising to £9.35 from £9.15. This is a 14pc compared to 2015. Those who purchase NHS prescriptions regularly can apply for a prepayment certificate, effectively a prescription “season-ticket”. An annual certificate costs £105.90, but can save you up to £333.30 if you need four items a month. It will save you money if you need more than 11 prescribed items each year.  A three-month certificate costs less than £30 and will save money for those buying more than three prescriptions over a three-month period. You can apply at your local pharmacy. ",4

Investing in the stock market in the current climate makes the most sense for savers as paltry rates on cash Isas make them unlikely to beat inflation. The rate of rising prices is expected to ramp up this year as the economy reopens.  heading . The best rate for a one-year fixed Isa is 0.5pc from Leeds and West Brom. A year ago the top rate paid 1.35pc. The best five-year fixed cash Isa is from Gatehouse Bank and UBL UK, paying 1.15pc, down from 1.6pc this time last year. Although fixed-term deals usually offer higher rates, savers must be confident they are happy to lock their money away for a period of time. The best flexible rate is 0.5pc from Al Rayan Bank. Rachel Springall of Moneyfacts, the financial analyst, said savers should switch to get the best deals, or ""look away from cash savings altogether"" if they can afford to take more risk.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/itv-teams-venture-capital-battles-streaming-giants/,business,"After enduring a brutal pandemic, Carolyn McCall will be praying that this year’s hopes for a summer of love come true. The   is betting on a sharp revival in the advertising market as Britain’s world-leading vaccine rollout takes effect - and relying on hits such as reality show   to tap into post-pandemic optimism. Advertising sales, which tumbled by £191m to £1.6bn last year, are poised to jump by up to 75pc next month as millions more jabs go in arms. But this growth may simply be masking a longer-term challenge as television fights for its future in an  . There are fears that the accelerated shift to digital during the pandemic may have forced TV advertisers into the hands of tech platforms. While some will flock back, others may never return. McCall is not taking such threats lying down. The 59-year-old former chief executive of EasyJet has unfurled a plan to help burnish ITV’s financial performance while nurturing a new generation of TV advertisers. ITV has launched ‘AdVentures Invest’, a media-for-equity fund where the broadcaster doles out TV advertising space in exchange for stakes in promising start-ups. The benefits are two-fold. If ITV backs the right company, it has the potential to make a hefty financial return that will support its own migration to streaming. Secondly, ITV can extol the virtues of the broadcasting world with a new breed of advertisers which may be   with the company’s ad platforms but overlooked the huge reach of TV. ITV plans to team up with venture capital funds to take up to 10 positions in companies over the next two years. Each offer will be worth more than £1m from a £15m pot set aside for the first 12 months. ITV has hired Niko Waesche to lead the charge, a venture capitalist who co-founded Germany’s leading media-for-equity fund German Media Pool. But can such modest media investments really compete in London’s fiercely competitive start-up scene that is flooded with venture capital and private equity funding? Even if they can, there is a risk ITV becomes lumbered with a string of companies that struggle to live up to their hype. Waesche is undaunted by the prospect. “Our programme is not to prove that TV works [...] it is about providing an option into the market that is superior to buying advertising with cash. The reason is because we have skin in the game,” he says. “That company knows we will provide our best people who have great insights into brand building and media strategy to help them be successful with a TV campaign. “We are primarily focused on the financial returns, but I think we can learn as much from the failures as we can from the successes of the companies we invest in.” In many ways, ITV is late to the party. Germany’s free-to-air broadcaster ProSieben has made a string of bets in digital companies through its media investment arm, SevenVentures. It was an early backer of Zalando, a German online fashion retailer that has grown into a tech juggernaut with a €22bn (£19bn) market value. UK media companies have also followed suit. Channel 4 Ventures - the broadcaster’s media-for-equity fund - has invested in the social media platform Pinterest and plant-based food business The Meatless Farm.  owner DMGT allows start-ups to target readers of the MailOnline or the   using such a model through its investment arm DMG Ventures. On Thursday, ITV announced its first investment when it took a £3m stake in  , a London-based digital mapping firm that has carved up the planet into 3m squares carrying three words to identify them. The platform, which has also attracted investment from Channel 4, claims to be a more efficient way of tracking locations than using a standard street address. It is an important marker for ITV, but the broadcaster may not always be able to have its own way in a start-up scene market awash with funding options. By zeroing in on consumer-focused firms, Waesche believes his company can hold its own. “We have to try and make our fund as pro-entrepreneurial as possible,” he adds. “That means we cannot be viewed as his big clunky corporate, but somebody that can make quick decisions and is used to the venture capital process. “ITV must be a highly-compatible and lean co-investor. We have spoken to the leading venture capital funds in the UK and we will expect them to be the lead in a transaction. “We are telling the VC’s ‘if you want to have a strong television partner at your side then we are there for you, but we are not going to be very difficult to deal with’. “Please invite us in and we promise to add value.” Berenberg analyst Sarah Simon says ITV’s funds will be offering an attractive proposition to budding entrepreneurs, but questions whether they can be as successful as Prosieben. Tom Harrington of Enders Analysis says ITV could get a double benefit, with “a gainful return on an exit like Pinterest for Channel 4” and advertising sales that have the potential to be “many times over the initial investment”. Waesche expects to hold each investment for up to five years before weighing a sale to another venture capital fund. By then, McCall will have hoped to have made some healthy returns to help cushion ITV’s transition to a purely digital world - starting with a bumper summer.",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/03/27/uks-oneweb-battles-elon-musk-broadband-space-race/,business,"On opposite sides of the Earth and just hours apart, rockets from satellite companies OneWeb and SpaceX blasted off this week, each delivering a payload of dozens of small satellites into low orbit. British-owned OneWeb,  , fired 36 satellites into space on the nose of a Soyuz rocket from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia’s far east. Around 6,670 miles away, Elon Musk’s SpaceX shot 60   into the sky from Cape Canaveral on the Florida coast. Musk’s Falcon 9 reusable launchers landed at sea aboard the robotic Of Course I Still Love You ship in the Atlantic. The launches are the latest stage in an accelerating space race between the two companies. Both firms want to blanket the Earth with satellites  . Despite OneWeb securing £400m in government investment, observers have noted SpaceX appears to have gained an early lead. Since January, users in the UK have been able to sign up to a beta trial of SpaceX’s service, installing a satellite dish that links up to one of its satellites circling about 690 miles above the Earth’s surface. Some have reported speeds in excess of 150 megabits per second. For that, they pay £89 per month. By selling these dishes directly to consumers, SpaceX hopes to bypass telcos and shake-up the market. But Neil Masterson, the new chief executive of OneWeb, doesn’t appear fazed. “We are not fighting the industry, but working with them.” OneWeb is hoping to sell to telecoms companies such as BT to reach remote rural locations. Founded in 2012, the company was a pioneer in the design and construction of mega-constellations of hundreds of satellites that could provide global broadband. It raised $3.4bn from the likes of Japan’s SoftBank, but it came unstuck last March when investors pulled the plug on new funding. An unexpected white knight came in the form of the British Government,  , which secured a $1bn deal to buy the remains of the company last year. But by the time OneWeb restarted launches in December, SpaceX had ramped up its own efforts. “OneWeb were the innovators in launching a big constellation,” says Marek Ziebart, a professor at University College London. “With Elon Musk, as typically happens in tech, someone else had burnt the research and development dollars doing the high-risk process of proving something can be done, and once it is done the vultures come down.” Musk’s Starlink now has more than 1,300 satellites in orbit, covering much of the northern hemisphere. In the UK, it offers its service around 50 degrees latitude north and expects to cover Britain by the end of the year. OneWeb’s Masterson says its own service, which as of Thursday morning had 146 satellites in orbit, will provide coverage from the “North Pole to Cornwall” by the end of the year. Rather than going directly to punters, OneWeb is portraying itself as an ally to telecoms companies. “One of our shareholders [Bharti] is one of the largest telcos in the world, and we have an   into every single telco around the world. It is the natural approach for us,” he says. That offer of help will be welcome in very rural areas where the cost of installing fibre is uneconomical. Network insiders believe a company like OneWeb, working on a business-to-business basis, would be useful for providing redundancy to fibre networks, in particular to critical infrastructure. However, many still see it as a niche solution. Some experts also do not believe the ultra high speeds enjoyed by early Starlink customers are sustainable.  With only a few thousand trial customers, high speeds are inevitable. “How this will work with hundreds of thousands of customers is unclear,” one telecoms expert says. Analysts say the ultimate winner in the race for a global constellation remains unclear. “OneWeb certainly lost some of its lead during Chapter 11 proceedings,” says Caleb Henry, an analyst at consultancy Quilty Analytics. “But OneWeb’s smaller constellation means it is not necessarily behind SpaceX.” OneWeb has roughly 22pc of its network complete, Quilty says, compared with about 11pc coverage by Starlink. Masterson says OneWeb is planning between eight and 10 launches this year as it seeks to regain its position against Starlink.  The UK-backed firm has also joined a pushback by satellite companies against Starlink’s vast expansion, which has seen a dash for territory in space – Starlink’s ultimate goal is to have 12,000 satellites over Earth.  In a recent filing to the US communications regulator, OneWeb argued SpaceX’s constellation would cause “harmful interference” and claimed its satellites had a “troubling failure rate” and were “plagued” with safety issues. SpaceX declined to comment. But OneWeb has its own critics. This week, MPs including Darren Jones, the chairman of the business committee, quizzed Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the transparency of the deal, and whether he had been personally involved in brokering it. Mr Johnson said: “I don’t think I could comment on exactly who did what.” At the time of the investment, which was championed by Dominic Cummings, a senior civil servant and the UK’s Space Agency questioned whether it represented value for money for the British taxpayer. OneWeb has another potential way to gain an advantage over Starlink. It could be used as a kind of redundancy system to GPS, which is made up of 24 satellites 12,000 miles up. OneWeb’s system could be used as a position, navigation and timing [PNT] system to prevent jamming or to step in if GPS went down, an issue that is feared would cost the UK £1bn per day. “This capability is not a target of SpaceX, and represents both a strategic and financial opportunity that could be sizeable,” Henry says. OneWeb is hoping to have its system fully operational by the middle of next year. It still has to raise about another $1bn to achieve this. It plans to scale up its business to around 480 people this year, almost the same number it had pre-bankruptcy, with 70pc in the UK.  In the race against a man as ambitious as Musk, there is no doubt it needs to make up for lost time.",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/sir-ian-cheshire-ex-barclays-boss-eyeing-bts-chairman-role/,business,"Until the pandemic hit, Sir Ian Cheshire had always been on the move. Born in Borneo, where his father was working for oil giant Shell, Cheshire got to travel the world with his family as a child. Such a nomadic existence has continued during his career. Thirty years in retail, dovetailed with nearly a decade as one of the Government’s top business advisers, and seats on the boards of Barclays and Whitbread, left him almost permanently on the road. But the coronavirus lockdown has left one of Britain’s best-known executives marooned in his holiday home on the Isle of Wight. “I’ve never in my entire life spent one year in one place,” he says. “[But] swapping the Jubilee line for walking the dogs on the beach is not a bad trade.” Cheshire was appointed to the board of BT a year ago and chairman of Spire Healthcare earlier this month. Getting up to speed with new jobs over Zoom or Microsoft Teams calls has not been without its challenges. “I’ve just learned to allow an extra 10 minutes to swear at the screen,” he says. It is not the only thing he has learnt. A lifelong Bruce Springsteen and Rolling Stones fan, Cheshire has recently found himself enjoying the Taylor Swift tunes played by his children. The former boss of Kingfisher and Debenhams is now angling for what would arguably be his biggest job yet: chairman of the BT board. The unexpected resignation of Jan du Plessis earlier this month, which came amid   with chief executive Philip Jansen, has left a tantilising opportunity. “It’s not a state secret that I will put my hand up,” he says. “If there’s an opportunity for me to do it, brilliant.” Despite being favourite within the City for the job, Cheshire is not counting his chickens. “As many of my more charitable friends have pointed out, the last four chairmen have all come from outside. So my chances are not necessarily that great, but I think it’s always good to have an internal option.” He is certainly talking like a leader, however. BT is at an “extraordinary inflection point”, Cheshire says. Regulator Ofcom is allowing the FTSE 100 company   to fund the rollout of full fibre broadband, the recent auction for 5G spectrum was , and he is hopeful that its gigantic retirement fund – which has so often weighed on BT’s valuation – is in a better position. “Suddenly a lot of the headwinds that BT has had are getting resolved,” he adds. Last summer Cheshire handed over the reins as the Government’s lead non-executive director to Lord Nash after five years in the job. Prior to that he spent four years advising the Department for Work and Pensions. He remains one of the Government’s “go-to” figures to lead high profile initiatives. In December he was asked to chair the £600m Sports Winter Survival Package to protect major spectator sports, for instance. As someone who has been privy to Whitehall decision-making for so long, he is well-placed to assess how Boris Johnson’s administration dealt with the health crisis. “[A] pandemic was always on the risk registers of all the departments, including the Cabinet Office,” he says. “I think what was misunderstood was the nature of the pandemic. It was a case of preparing for the flu when it was actually [more similar to] SARS. “There’s always the danger that you fight the last war, or you fight the wrong war. And I think this didn’t become clear early enough. So we prepped, and there was lots of war-gaming, [but] it just wasn’t necessarily for the right thing.” Cheshire also highlights the Government’s well-documented reticence to introduce restrictions at the beginning of the crisis. Ministers will “have to lock down much more aggressively” if and when a future pandemic hits Britain. Speaking in front of his great grandparents’ Welsh dresser, Cheshire steps out for a moment to deal with questions from workmen that are redecorating his office. His wife Kate is out, volunteering by driving people to get their Covid vaccination. He has no complaints on Johnson’s immunisation rollout. The vaccination programme has been “spectacular”, he says. “What was just striking was the willingness to commit early to invest.” Given his background in the retail sector, Cheshire is dismayed at the damage Covid has done to Britain’s high streets. Some of the country’s best-known names have gone to the wall during the pandemic, not least  , the department store he chaired for three years before being ousted by Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley in 2019. He has long been a critic of the high rents retailers have had to pay and believes the worst is yet to come for commercial landlords. “I started shutting bricks and mortar stores when I arrived at B&Q in 2005,” he says. “I was confronted with these 35-year leases. I was left thinking: ‘how the hell do you get out of a 35-year lease?’ ... If I had a store that wasn’t making money, I couldn’t get out of it.” Cheshire continues: “If on the other hand, the lease was ending, I could close it.” Landlords would then re-let the space for significantly less than B&Q was paying, he argues. “I could never get my head around this disconnect where the property market does start to react, but it’s on the bits that become vacant. “The UK is quite unique to have these long leases – in France they are much shorter, in the US they are much shorter – and that creates this overhang in the market and [landlords] won’t admit that the property is worth less. Everyone is sort of in this ‘delay and pray’ type territory.” Debenhams could have been saved before the pandemic, Cheshire says. But that required landlords to accept that just 50 of its 170 stores were profitable enough to stay open. “We couldn’t persuade the landlords to do the real change that was needed,” he says. The standoff and being locked into multi-year bank loans, left Debenhams “in a sort of zombie loop”. Having stepped down as Barclays UK chairman in January, Cheshire has been able to dedicate more of his time to promoting sustainable farming and food production – a passion that he has had ever since returning to the Borneo rainforest on holiday as a teenager. Cheshire was knighted in 2014 for services to business, sustainability and the environment. And he now wants the prime minister to set up a dedicated bank to support “agroecology”, which advocates the use of green technologies, eliminating the need for synthetic fertilisers and pesticides. It also promotes increasing the amount of land dedicated for ponds, hedges and meadows. Cheshire insists he is not campaigning for a taxpayer handout. “There are limits to what the private sector can do to help kickstart change,” he says. “It is very difficult to go green if you are in the red.”",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/30/ballooning-borrowing-threatens-italys-recovery-imf-warns/,business,"Mounting debts pose a serious risk to Italy’s economic future as the government and businesses  , the International Monetary Fund has warned. Steady improvements in the vaccine programme could help the economy unlock and rebound later this year, the IMF said. “However, many businesses could still face excessive debt and large equity gaps, leading them to scale back or shut down, causing layoffs and higher unemployment if reallocation and new business formation are slow,” economists warned. If it takes longer to tackle the pandemic, the situation could be even worse, with bad business debts hitting banks and so undermining their ability to finance the recovery. “Slower resolution of the pandemic would delay the recovery, increase firms’ leverage and worker layoffs and preserve elevated saving rates,” the IMF said. “Were loan quality to deteriorate markedly, banks’ capacity to lend to support the recovery could be constrained and contingent fiscal liabilities could materialise.” The , as steps to support incomes and businesses - praised by the IMF - have pushed up the state’s already high debts. In late 2019 before Covid struck, Italy’s national debt was already more than 135pc of GDP - far above any other eurozone nation except Greece. By the third quarter of 2020 the debt had risen to 154pc of GDP, as the pandemic forced up borrowing. “The public sector has appropriately absorbed much of the income loss brought by the pandemic, but policies should be refined as the recovery proceeds,” the IMF said. This means targeting support on individuals and industries that are suffering the most from Covid, while withdrawing spending on those that no longer need it. The watchdog said Italy needed to show international investors that its debt was on a long-term sustainable path to ensure interest rates on its bumper debt remain low and affordable. “Spending as needed to address the pandemic shock and secure the recovery should be accompanied by a credible plan to anchor significant - albeit gradual - debt reduction once the recovery is entrenched,” the IMF said. “A credible strategy for reducing the public debt ratio requires well-identified reforms to raise economic growth and to increase the efficiency and equity of government spending and tax systems.”",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/23/sunak-cuts-tax-scottish-flights-bolster-union/,business,"Rishi Sunak has announced plans to cut taxes for flights to Scotland to boost the “social cohesion of the Union”. A reduction in domestic   will be paid for by an increase in the tax imposed on long-haul flights - prompting criticism from the owner of British Airways.  Plans being considered include only charging air passenger duty one-way for domestic flights - previously outlawed when the UK was still in the EU - or introducing a lower band for domestic flights. “Domestic connectivity is a central pillar of the Government’s commitment to supporting the Union and  ,” a consultation published by the Treasury stated. “Domestic connectivity is vital in fostering integration between all parts of the UK and increasing the social cohesion of the Union. Travel by road or rail is not always practical for certain journeys within the UK, and it is important our domestic air network enables those who live in the UK to connect to areas that are otherwise hard to reach.” Aviation levies have been split into two bands: flights to destinations up to 2,000 miles away, and flights travelling more than that distance.  An economy flight from London and Edinburgh with easyJet costs less than £50, for instance. Of this, £13 - more than a quarter of the overall price - is air passenger duty.  Jonathan Hinkles, boss of regional airline Loganair, said: ""We are heartened to see the consultation around the promised changes to air passenger duty, which cannot come a moment too soon for domestic air travel.   ""The ability to make the change is one of very few benefits for the aviation industry from Brexit and it will help to address the significant loss of connectivity throughout all parts of the UK caused by APD."" While the move will be welcomed by some short-haul carriers, it will come as a blow to airlines such as BA that make bigger profits running long-haul services. A spokesman for BA owner IAG said: ""We have always said that APD should be abolished. Given the acute pressure on business, the hike in international APD will make it even harder for UK firms to trade overseas. This is a tax on Global Britain. We will be submitting our views in due course."" Long-haul travel has been hardest hit by the pandemic, with experts predicting that it will be the slowest to recover to pre-pandemic levels.  The Treasury is consulting on proposals to increase the amount of air passenger duty on long-haul flights by doubling the number of bands to four and introducing a frequent flyer levy.  Charging long-haul passengers more were part of what ministers called the “polluter pays principle”.  The consultation read: “Those who travel furthest internationally, and consequently have the greatest impact on the environment, [should] incur the most APD.”",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/24/taxpayer-backed-snp-deal-promised-2000-jobs-delivers-fewer-50/,business,"Fewer than 50 of a promised 2,000 new jobs have been created as a result of a taxpayer-backed takeover of the UK’s last aluminium smelter, a senior SNP minister has admitted. Fergus Ewing, the SNP rural economy secretary, said the 44 additional people had been hired since the Scottish Government agreed to provide a 25-year financial guarantee,  that allowed steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta to take over an industrial site in Fort William, in 2016. Then, it was claimed that the investment would create 1,000 direct jobs and a further 1,000 indirect jobs, while adding £1 billion to the local economy, within a decade. However, Mr Gupta’s GFG Alliance is now facing a funding crisis,   Mr Ewing delivered a statement to Holyrood on Wednesday to address fears that Mr Gupta’s empire, which also includes the Dalzell steel plant in Motherwell, is now on the brink of collapse. Mr Ewing told MSPs that Mr Gupta had personally assured him last week of the “underlying operational health” of his Scottish assets despite acknowledging “challenges” caused by the collapse of Greensill.  Defending the Government’s   in a deal which also included nearby hydro plans used to power it and a large Lochaber estate, he said the alternative would have been to see the facility close. However, Willie Rennie, the Scottish LibDem leader, challenged Mr Ewing after he said there had been 44 new jobs at the site, taking the overall total to just 200. Mr Rennie said: “The Government told us five years ago that the multiplier and supply chain impacts in Lochaber would be worth 2,000 jobs. Are we ever going to see those jobs, and what discussions did he have with Mr Gupta about creating those jobs?” Mr Ewing replied that the jobs that had been created were “valuable” but admitted the firm’s original plans for building an alloy wheels plant “could not proceed” due to problems in the British car industry. He added: “That’s simply a fact that nobody anticipated in 2016, not Mr Rennie, not Mr me [sic], or anybody else. “However, the company have come forward with an amended plan which includes a billets plant and a [water] canning plant. There’s challenges ahead, but we are working extremely hard with everybody to achieve delivery of these objectives.” The deal the Scottish Government agreed with Mr Gupta in 2016 saw it agree to a 25-year guarantee to buy energy from the Lochaber hydro plants, should the smelter shut down, worth between £14m and £32m per year. ",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/27/englands-giant-subsidy-scotland-just-sturgeons-nats-like/,business,"Why all the fuss about  , now again the subject of fierce debate north of the border as we approach May’s Holyrood elections? Is not Scotland already essentially an independent nation; to finally cut the Gordian knot is only to formally recognise a pre-existing disposition. It might also save the rest of the UK a great deal of money. That’s too flippant a way of looking at things, no doubt, but the Scottish government certainly behaves as if it is running an entirely independent country, an impression further underpinned by the pandemic, where Scotland maintains a largely independent containment policy. Call it devolution if you like, but from the outside, it looks like much more. Across multiple fronts, public policy is now so completely divergent from the rest of the UK that Scotland might as well be fully sovereign. So divergent, in fact, that you begin to wonder whether it is not the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, rather than Boris Johnson, who these days calls the shots for the union as a whole. Her offer of a  , snuck out on the very eve of pre-election purdah - a vote buying initiative if ever there was one - has had the real Prime Minister down in Westminster scurrying off shamefacedly to reconsider his stingy  . How is it, you may well ask,  , but unaffordable down south, which to the extent that anywhere in the UK these days generates a fiscal surplus is where it tends to occur? It’s called the Barnett formula, after the former Labour chief secretary to the Treasury, Joe Barnett, and it works like this. Every year, the budget of the devolved administrations is set by taking the previous year’s spending and adding a pro rata share of whatever increase there has been for the UK as a whole. Last financial year, the Barnett block grant to Scotland amounted to £32bn. The effect is that historic differences in spending are preserved in aspic regardless of whether any longer justified. A further distortion arises because Scotland’s population has been shrinking relative to England’s, which boosts nominal spending per head over time - such that it is today more than 20pc higher than England. As it is, the only parts of the UK that in normal times generate a fiscal surplus - in the sense that they raise more in tax than they spend - are London, the South East and East England. Everywhere else spends more than they raise in tax. For Scotland, the shortfall in 2019 was £2,482 per head. Actually, this is not particularly high by the standards of some UK regions. For instance, the North East spends £4,064 per head more than it raises in tax, according to the latest ONS data. But here’s the point. Scotland is by no means a poor part of the UK; actually, average earnings are roughly the same as the UK as a whole. It follows that Scotland’s per capita contribution to tax revenues is also roughly the same. Scotland’s slightly higher top rates of income tax make only a marginal difference. Revenues from North Sea oil have also ceased to offer much by way of the offset once claimed for them by Scottish separatists. In any case, if you want to know why Scotland can “afford” free higher education, free social care, free prescriptions, a 4pc pay rise for healthcare workers, and all the rest, but England can’t, ask the late Joe Barnett. It is also why the Scottish National Party opposes anything by way of meaningful reform. They know a good thing when they see one. Despite the distortions, they will not be backing the “needs based” system sometimes proposed by way of a fairer alternative. The UK Government also guaranteed continuation of the Barnett formula when campaigning against Scottish independence in the 2014 referendum. We tamper with it at the union’s peril. Indeed, the only way it could plausibly be changed is ironically via a vote for independence in the second referendum Sturgeon threatens to demand should she win an overall majority in the  . Personally, I doubt those ambitions have been as badly damaged by   over who knew what and when as imagined, even with the split in the nationalist vote threatened by Salmond’s new political party. All the same, for Boris Johnson the spat is like a gift from the gods, confirming his reputation as the luckiest of generals. Brexit seemed to doom him to the ignominy of being the Tory Prime Minister who took us out of Europe’s common market only to lose the union.  Exquisitely, the sight of the Scottish National Party tearing itself limb from limb over a matter that nobody could quite understand beyond the evident visceral hatred the participants have for one another, like clansmen fighting in a field, seems to have come to his rescue. Unwise to bet on it quite yet, though. The emotional pull of independence remains a mighty powerful one. This despite the fact that far from easing since the last referendum, the economic challenges of actually implementing a fully independent Scotland have steepened yet further, such that they today seem almost insurmountable. The question of who pays refuses to go away. Given the EU’s almost existential difficulties right now, Europe is not going to be exactly rushing to fill the vacuum in Scotland’s finances left by removal of the English teet. Some part of the shortfall could be met by cancelling Scotland’s share of UK defence spending, yet that would only further undermine the economy by rendering the country’s role as a major UK defence contractor and home to Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent obsolete. Even if Scotland is forgiven its share of Britain’s national debt - a degree of magnanimous generosity rarely seen before when countries go their separate ways (though interestingly, it is what eventually happened in the case of the Republic of Ireland) - massive tax hikes and spending cuts would be required to put Scotland’s public finances on a sustainable footing. For a country that still feels badly wronged by years of Tory austerity, that’s quite an ask. A plausible answer over what to do about the currency has also yet been proposed. Sterlingisation is no kind of a solution; just think what would have happened to Scotland with no lender of last resort to bankroll the emergency expenditure that has been required by Covid. On its own account, Holyrood would have found credit impossible to access. The fact is that the unsatisfactory nature of today’s settlement suits Sturgeon’s Scottish nationalists rather better than they care to admit, sustained in power as they are by the largesse of the Barnett formula and the unfulfilled dream of independence. The challenges of the real thing would very likely finish them off.",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/28/independence-risks-economic-havoc-scots/,business,"Until the early 18th century, crossing the border between Scotland and England meant entering a lawless territory plagued by raiders, livestock rustlers and an assortment of other ne’er do wells – who, in the phrasing of William Wordsworth, would “prey alike on two distracted countries”. Small forts, walled homesteads and pele towers still litter the landscape with reminders of that blood-soaked age. Thankfully, after more than three hundred years of political union, things are a lot simpler: travellers are more likely to be greeted by a Saltire sign reading   (welcome to Scotland) – or, coming the other way, the signs of the Northumberland or Cumbria county councils – than a freebooter. But political strife threatens to return. May’s elections could trigger a major push for a  , just seven years after “once in a generation” plebiscite. The SNP is polling around 50pc and is expected to demand a new vote if it wins a  . Yet much has changed since last time. Economically and financially there have been three main shifts: Brexit, a Covid-enforced boom in debt and a global plunge in oil prices. All make the prospect of independence significantly more challenging. The SNP’s long-standing policy, championed by Nicola Surgeon, is for an independent Scotland to  . But analysis suggests taking such a step too quickly could have devastating consequences. Scotland’s economy is hugely open, with imports and exports each equivalent to around 60pc of its GDP. The country trades about three to four times as much with the rest of the UK as it does with the EU. “The received wisdom sometimes in Scotland seems to be that because Brexit is bad, 'Scexit' and reversing leaving the EU would be good economically,” says David Phillips, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. “I am not sure that is true, certainly in the short to medium-term. “With a reasonably hard version of Brexit there is almost a choice – do you be part of the UK single market or the EU’s single market?” Trade modellers from the London Schools of Economics say seccession would eventually slash income per capita in Scotland by as much as 8.7pc, dwarfing Brexit’s anticipated long-term hit of 2pc. Rejoining the EU would “do little to mitigate the costs of Scottish independence”, according to these experts, shaving the fall only slightly to between 6.3pc and 7.6pc – and only in the long run. In the short term, they say that returning to the EU would be   than remaining in a common market with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The modellers point to a paradox in the economic argument for leaving the UK and joining European bloc. “For an independent Scotland to be better off inside the EU, independence must destroy a sufficiently large share of Scotland’s trade with the rest of the UK that the EU becomes Scotland’s most important trade partner,” they say. “For rejoining the EU to be economically desirable, independence itself must bring substantial economic costs.” Hanwei Huang, one of the report’s authors, says disentangling the Scottish economy would likely prove more complicated than Brexit. “It probably would depend on the future relationship between the UK and the EU,” he says. “For example, if the UK and EU has a closer relationship, probably it is more attractive for them to stay in the UK common market.” The dangers of an immediate re-entrance to the EU show how much the economic case for Scottish independence has weakened since 2014 – even before factors such as the recovery from Covid-19 are taken into account. Covid has given Britain its  . The national debt has surged by more than a third, from just under £1.5 trillion in 2014 to more than £2.1 trillion now. Working out how to split this bill, built up over centuries, will be politically fraught - and economically critical for a newly independent nation trying to win the confidence of international markets. In 2014 the Scottish Government suggested splitting it by “historic contribution” to the finances, arguing that since 1980 oil revenues meant Scotland has chipped in more than the rest of the country. This would result in Caledonia taking around 5pc of the national debt. Westminster argued this was spurious as extra spending also goes north. In addition, the sums change radically depending on the base year - counting only from 1990 to 2014 and Scotland’s share doubles to almost 10pc. That translates to either £105bn or £210bn. An alternative is to split the debt by share of the population. This would give an independent Scotland just over 8pc of the UK’s national debt, or around £170bn. Either way, investors who bought UK bonds will not see some morph into Scottish bonds. Instead, Scotland would pay the interest on the agreed share of the debt then potentially take some on as the bonds mature, depending on the deal. Meanwhile,  . In 2014 prices seemed permanently high, with fevered talk of Brent reaching $200 per barrel: ideal conditions to finance Scottish spending for years to come. But prices tumbled, dragging tax revenues from the North Sea to a small fraction of their old level. Investment has plunged, output is set to fall steadily and 2050 net zero emissions targets mean the energy source is out of favour altogether. A 2018 report from the Sustainable Growth Commission, established by the SNP, acknowledged the shift and suggested an independent Scotland should treat future oil and gas revenues as “windfalls” rather than a reliable basis for day to day budget planning. As things stand now, that day to day budget would be seriously in the red. Before the pandemic, Scottish tax revenues per capita were a touch lower than those in the UK as a whole, while spending was higher. Mairi Spowage at the University of Strathclyde’s Fraser of Allander Institute notes that this extra spend – some of it set by Westminster, but some, particularly on education and healthcare, decided in Holyrood – means Scotland typically runs a notional budget deficit around six percentage points bigger than the UK’s. In 2019-20 this came in at 8.6pc versus the UK’s 2.6pc. “They tell us little about the long-term sustainability of the public finances of an independent Scotland, because presumably there would be different choices made, different priorities and perhaps things that they would choose not to spend money on as well,” she says. As the Scottish Government puts it: “The whole point of independence is to give the Scottish Parliament all the economic levers it needs to grow our economy and to make the public spending choices best suited to Scotland’s interests – such as not spending hundreds of billions of pounds on the  .” Yet even trimming defence and UK-wide project spending would only cover around one-tenth of the deficit, according to Phillips. Financial markets might be willing to lend big sums at small interest rates through Covid, but they are unlikely to fund large deficits year in, year out. “At the moment, in effect, Scotland is able to slightly live beyond its means because of the fiscal transfers from the rest of the UK,” says Phillips. “Scotland could be a successful independent country, but it would have to fund its own public spending, rather than have some of it implicitly funded by transfers from the rest of the UK. “That would require some combination of tax rises, austerity and borrowing in the first decade at least of an independent Scotland.”",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/31/150bn-pandemic-savings-pot-set-fuel-economic-recovery/,business,"As spring takes hold and the economy begins to unlock, a savings glut of epic proportions is promising to fuel the fightback from Covid-19 - so long as Britons are ready to part with their new-found loot. The latest Office for National Statistics figures show that UK households piled up £59.8bn in savings between October and December, as the second shutdown and widespread restrictions pushed the share of income put aside up to 16.1pc.  The savings lake totalled £200bn in the nine months to December, some £125bn more than the equivalent period in 2019, with billions more to come following another interminable lockdown so far this year. This unprecedented financial firepower has prompted the Bank of England’s chief economist to predict the UK will leap ahead like a “coiled spring” on a “rip-roaring recovery” following a 9.8pc Covid-induced slump in growth during 2020. Andy Haldane expects consumers to unleash £150bn of savings, while politicians from Boris Johnson downward are urging Britons to “have fun”  as pubs and restaurants prepare to reopen outdoors from April 12.  Whether the British public will take the advice - and what they will spend their cash on - remains to be seen. Restaurant booking site TheFork has processed over 115,000 queries from desperate UK diners since Johnson revealed the route out of lockdown, but UKHospitality chief Kate Nicholls is cautious Fewer than a third of venues can open outside, she says, and those which do are likely to take just a fifth of their usual revenues. “It does take time to recover confidence, and social distancing controls cap capacity and earnings so we do need the Government to stick to the plan to lift restrictions on June 21,"" Nicholls says. Big ticket items and staycations are more likely targets, market research firm GfK says, after a big bounceback in its major purchases index to the highest level for a year. “For those lucky enough to have savings, I think we're going to see spending on home luxuries,"" he says. ""You can't buy a hot tub for love nor money at the moment, because they've all been snapped up in anticipation of a staycation somewhere. So anything to sort of beautify a beautiful home and garden. ""Try to get a sofa from John Lewis at the moment and so you're looking at 19 weeks.” According to forecasts by tourism body VisitBritain, almost £62bn will be spent on domestic tourism this year - 79pc up on a bleak 2020, but still only two-thirds of 2019 levels. The key question is who has the savings. Several economists talk about pent-up demand, but the impact of the pandemic has been brutally unequal. Haldane’s monetary policy committee colleague Gertjan Vlieghe made that point in a speech last month as he stressed that only households in the top 40pc of incomes have enjoyed a big savings rise. Their incomes have been largely maintained while spending has fallen sharply.  “Mental accounting” could play a part if these new-found savings are treated as wealth rather than income. The so-called propensity to spend out of “wealth” is small - an estimated 5pc - compared to a much higher tendency to spend extra income, of between 10pc and 50pc. But the highest propensity to splash out comes among the lower income households, who are more likely to have been running savings down or have been furloughed during the pandemic. For this reason, Vlieghe’s colleague Silvana Tenreyro predicts a faster consumer recovery in the US because of the $1,400 cheques landing in American bank accounts under the Biden stimulus. This is more likely to be treated as “income” compared to the UK’s skewed distribution of savings towards better off households, she adds, “stacking the odds” in favour of a more pronounced spending boom for the US. So far the caution appears to be borne out by the survey evidence. BAML economist Rob Wood’s latest online snapshot showed that of those who had saved more during the pandemic, only 27pc intended to spend more. By contrast 38pc said they would save more and 11pc pay down more debt. Wood says: “People are clearly going to spend more than they have been. ""But there isn't anything in the survey that says people who’ve saved a lot of money are just going to go on a tear for three months.” A YouGov poll had a similar message as fewer than a fifth of respondents plan to spend half or more of what they have saved.  Despite the reopening, flies in the ointment include the end of the furlough scheme in September - likely to spark rising unemployment - and the unknowable impact of a year of lockdowns on consumer behaviour. But  , UK economist at Capital Economics, points out that people don’t need to spend the savings glut to boost the recovery: they simply have to return to pre-Covid savings patterns. “The possibility that people actually go out and spend their excess savings is a big upside to our forecasts,” she says.  ",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/30/britain-must-reverse-baby-bust-toavoid-italian-decline/,business,"The pitter-patter of tiny   feet has been even harder to hear in Italy over the past 12 months after the pandemic struck a nation already bearing the sorry label of Europe’s biggest demographic disaster zone. At the end of last year, births plunged by almost 22pc across 15 Italian cities nine months on from the beginning of the lockdown. If Auguste Comte’s famous dictum that “demographics is destiny” is any guide, it spells more bad news for a country which already has the highest share of over-65s in Europe, at 22.8pc.  Italy’s total fertility rate has been   to stand at 1.3 births per woman, far below the 2.1 “replacement rate” to replenish population, absent migration. Early in the pandemic, more than a third of couples abandoned plans to procreate, and Guiseppe Conte’s administration turned to bribes in a bid to turn the demographic supertanker last June with plans for monthly payments of up to €240 (£205) for new mothers under a new Family Act. On this side of the Channel the fertility rate is higher, standing at almost 1.7 in England and Wales in 2018. But there are enough warning signs for ministers to be concerned about slipping into an Italian-style trap.  The latest comes from Southampton University’s Centre for Population Change, which weighs up a myriad of factors such as 200,000 delayed weddings, frustrated chances to socialise and economic uncertainty. It comes up with a worst case scenario of 66,000 fewer children born in 2023 if the previous   is combined with a . It estimates that the fertility rate already slipped below the previous lows of 1977 and 2001 to just 1.6 in 2020 – but could fall even closer to Italian levels by 2023 at 1.45. Idiosyncrasies have deepened the Italian problem, such as much lower female participation in the workforce, which is linked to lower fertility. In a traditionally Catholic country fewer Italian children are born outside of marriage and they live in the family home for longer. Meanwhile economic uncertainty and a lack of job opportunities prompted almost 160,000 Italians to emigrate in 2018: some 21,000 chose to come here.  But there are also similarities which should strike a worrying chord in the UK, such as a patchy and expensive childcare system and a decade-long hangover from the financial crisis which is hampering the ability of young people to “transition” into adulthood and start families. Since 2000, for example, the share of British 20-34 year olds living at home has risen from 20pc to 26pc, with almost a million more people now living with their parents. While the UK does not share Italy’s cultural ties to the family home, the story is more about affordability following a decade of virtually stagnant pay for younger cohorts now entering what is supposed to be their demographic prime.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out in 2019 that the age group that had done worse since the financial crisis were those in their 30s, who emerged into the jobs market in the 20s in the immediate aftermath of the recession and are still suffering average earnings 7pc below the pre-crisis level for their age. The average age of first-time buyers in the property market has  , and research shows the rise of the private rented sector is bad news for fertility as parents are exposed to the greater uncertainty it brings such as the unsettling effect of potentially being forced to move their offspring around schools.  Other ingredients in this unappetising demographic dish include the impact of ultra-loose monetary policy since 2009 which has sent cash into assets like homes in a search for yield due to ultra low interest rates. That has pushed up prices along with the Government’s , fuelling a scarcely interrupted jamboree for housebuilders since George Osborne introduced the scheme in 2013.  The result of these myriad factors is that the very age group which we would usually expect to do the population “heavy lifting” (so to speak) has been the biggest economic victim of the past few years.  This requires some hard and radical thinking from ministers, especially as lower immigration acts as another handbrake. The previous all-time low for fertility was in 2001, on the cusp of a wave of immigration from the European Union accession countries; whatever the societal implications of the influx ahead of the Brexit vote, the arrival of younger workers was a boon for population growth.  The Migration Advisory Committee modelled what happened in 2004 against the Labour Government’s original more restrictive proposals and found the overall population would have been more than 3pc smaller with a similar drop in overall output. Following Covid, the population tailwind has partially reversed with more than 180,000   in the past year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Some estimates put the UK’s population fall as high as 1.3m in the past 12 months.  Migration is likely to be permanently lower under the points system, so the Government needs to pull supply side levers. Its mortgage guarantee scheme for first time buyers risks exacerbating the affordability problem if it simply encourages demand without impetus to supply. Conservative backbench opposition to last year’s planning White Paper was depressingly predictable, but speeding up the delivery of affordable new homes is probably the best hope for prising young people away from the parental hearth and getting on to making babies. The CPC’s demographics professor Ann Berrington suggests “small cash benefits” for would-be parents are unlikely to work: the Government instead needs to look at a range of more family friendly policies and more generous subsidies for childcare, where the UK ranks among the most expensive in the world according to the OECD. Boris Johnson has looked after the old, through lockdown – and through the preservation of the pension “triple lock” – but now he needs to offer something to the young. Labour data shows young people bearing almost two-thirds of the fall in employment since the pandemic struck: the danger is the same sorry saga of the financial crisis will be played out again, and the UK will follow Italy further down a barren path.",4

The big winner is Czech billionaire Daniel Kretínský, who either through luck or spectacular foresight, began buying shares last year when they were trading at all-time lows of less than 150p. Nicknamed “The Czech Sphinx”, he will be smiling like a Cheshire cat after building a stake now worth £730m. Even Williams, a veteran of multiple corporate shake-ups, will be surprised by the dramatic turn around in the company’s fortunes. This time last year, with losses standing at £1m a day in the UK, the former BA boss was speculating whether Royal Mail would be able to make it through winter.  The only thing Back’s £1.8bn “transformation plan” succeeded in transforming was relations with the unions, and not for the better. He infuriated the Communication Workers Union, first by trying to force through changes to pay and working conditions while commuting from his luxury Swiss apartment, then refusing to jet into Britain at all when the pandemic struck. Williams has  with an inflation-busting pay deal that even the CWU, a notoriously tough nut to crack, hailed as “excellent”. It helps too that the union has turned its guns on BT with threat of a first national strike in more than three decades in a row over planned job cuts and site closures. It’s pick and shovel work but it has paved the way for Williams to implement some swift reforms including the development of a , and the rollout of new technology and automation. It’s also become apparent that the underlying opportunity for Royal Mail is huge. Amid an explosion in online shopping during the pandemic, parcel deliveries are booming at home and abroad, and a decline in letter volumes has been less precipitous than feared. As the logistics for the new economy are created, there is the potential to become an exciting high-growth company. Amazon, UPS, Hermes, or DHL scoff at the suggestion that a plodding corporate dinosaur could win the delivery wars but none are capable of building a network that encompasses every door in the country. Royal Mail’s decision to start Sunday deliveries, as well as collections for returns, is a decisive moment in the battle. There are caveats – the pandemic boom could fizzle out, further skirmishes with the CWU can’t be ruled out, and service remains unreliable – but the resurgence at Royal Mail is shaping up to be one of the most astonishing of recent times. It was only in 2019, that Vince Cable boasted that as business secretary   by landing Royal Mail's problems on shareholders rather than the taxpayer. Once again, it looks like he missed the point. What a buzz. First Moonpig, then Deliveroo, followed by Trustpilot, Cazoo and now PensionBee. The stock market is being flooded with a new generation of companies claiming to be the next big tech disruptors. But how many are genuine technology firms? . It’s been dubbed “The Monzo of Pensions”, as if that automatically makes it a high-growth company deserving of a sky-high valuation, when it should in fact act as a red flag to potential investors. For all the hype around Monzo and Revolut, they are  . Losses have spiralled during the pandemic and in a desperate attempt to make money, the so-called digital challenger banks are being forced to branch out, offering over-priced premium accounts and other services with questionable demand. So much for the online lockdown boom. That’s not to say that PensionBee is a bad company. Founder Romi Savova is a former investment banker with an entrepreneurial flair. She’s spotted an interesting opportunity  . The company says the potential is huge: there are an estimated 20m people within its core target market, each with at least two pension pots. Yet for all the supposed promise, growth has been remarkably elusive for a business set up seven years ago. It has just 400,000 customers and £1.5bn of assets under management. And there’s little evidence of the opportunity being monetised - turnover was a meagre £6.2m in 2019, while losses almost doubled to £10.4m. Yet reports suggest that the company hopes to command a stock market valuation of between £300m and £350m, equivalent to nearly 50 times revenue, even at the bottom end. The reality is that PensionBee is little more than an online pensions provider and “tech-enabled” is not the same as being a pure technology company such as Facebook or Google. The same goes for Cazoo, currently motoring towards   - not London - apparently because UK investors don’t get tech like the Americans, claims founder Alex Chesterman. But what is there to “get”, exactly? It sells cars online, which is enough apparently to warrant a $7bn (£5bn) valuation despite its loss-making status and annual turnover of just $1bn. Maybe they’re just more gullible on the other side of the Atlantic?",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/03/30/meet-romi-savova-35-year-old-ex-banker-battled-sexism-build/,business,"Romi Savova, the 35-year-old chief executive of  , is about to become one of the wealthiest female technology chief executives in the UK.  On Tuesday, the company she founded in 2014 announced that it would go public on the London Stock Exchange in a deal that would value it between £300m and £350m. The float, which is a major win for the capital, could see Savova’s 45pc stake rise to as much as £157m.  “We've been working on it for so long, it's nice to see it out in the open,” she says with a smile in a video call from her London flat, where she lives with her Spanish husband and two young children The £55m funding injection from the float will give Savova the money she needs to continue shaking up what she calls the  . PensionBee lets customers manage their pensions from a smartphone app and also offers them one-to-one help from its team of so-called “BeeKeepers."" ""I was convinced that people would only want to do things on their phones and they wouldn't want to interact with real humans,"" Savova says. ""That assumption was proven wrong within the first week."" The executive says she's always had a different way of looking at things. That might be down to her upbringing in Bulgaria, where she was born to two doctor parents while the country struggled under communism. “I definitely have some interesting memories of waiting outside grocery stores for whatever was inside, usually one type of thing or two different items,” Savova recalls. Shortly after communism fell, her family moved to South Africa where Savova, who speaks with a transatlantic accent, joined high school. “The earliest entrepreneurial memory, according to my Dad, is me charging for my artwork,” she jokes. “It wasn't that great, by the way.” Savova moved to the US to study economics and international studies at Emory University in Atlanta. She joined Goldman Sachs in 2007 just before the financial crisis, a sobering experience for the then-analyst.  She later moved to become an associate at Morgan Stanley where she analysed pensions. After a series of punishing 3am finishes that made her question the impact of her work, she left to join  , a technology start-up, as its fourth employee. “It wasn't until I left [Morgan Stanley] and tried to move my own pension that I realised just how difficult it is if you're just a normal human being who wants to do something sensible with their money,” she says.  After a year of work at Credit Benchmark, Savova started PensionBee in 2014 to try to simplify pensions. “When we first started up a lot of people said it's not possible,” she recalls. “This crazy idea of people taking control of their own retirements, how wild is that? We definitely encountered a lot of scepticism.” Being a female founder in a male-dominated industry has also caused Savova to deal with sexist comments that male executives are unlikely to experience. “I do think that everyday sexism is still alive,” she says, referring to regular questions she receives about juggling motherhood and running a business. ""I almost always get asked [about] it,"" she says. ""Being asked about your children and how your children impact on your business, when you hear that as a woman you immediately think that's because you're wondering about my commitment."" ""As women, sometimes we hear things differently and it's important for people to understand how what you are saying is being heard,"" she adds. PensionBee now has 130,000 active customers after a bumper year in 2020, Savova says, which sped up its plans to float. While rival chief executives dismiss rumours of discussions about going public, PensionBee has planned this move since 2016. “It's always been on the roadmap because I think large financial services companies that serve consumers ultimately end up being public,” Savova says. PensionBee’s chief executive may have had a recent   on  , but she doesn’t share his enthusiasm for the introduction of   in London that would allow technology founders to float their companies while retaining control. “I do think that we need to take a look at these reforms very carefully and decide if they're going to be leading to the kind of society we want to live in,” she says. Many technology businesses such as   have embraced   (SPACs) and are plotting floats in New York rather than London. But Savova feels strongly that a London float is right for PensionBee. “There were never truly alternatives,” she says. PensionBee’s main battle now is increasing its revenues, which were £6.3m last year, while minimising its losses which are understood to have doubled to £13m in 2020. “Our view is that at the end of the day, businesses need to be profitable,” Savova says. She’s targeting the end of 2023 as the period when the company will reach breakeven. Until then, its plans are firmly rooted in the UK, with a London float around the corner and UK expansion on the cards for the next few years. “For us it feels like the growth opportunity here is just so big that it's tough to make a business case to be abroad,” Savova says. “I do think the industry at its heart wants to do better,” she says, “it's just sometimes a bit stuck in the past.” Her hope is that PensionBee can continue dragging pensions into the current century.",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/31/brace-wave-financial-scandals-wake-greensill-archegos/,business,"One of the many remarkable features of the current downturn –  , as we are repeatedly told – is quite how few major corporate/financial collapses and scandals, normally part of the meat and drink of a bad recession, it has so far produced. Until now, that is. In short order we’ve had first the supply chain finance company  , and now the blow-up of a multi-billion dollar family-owned hedge fund  . Fortunately, neither of them appear at this stage to be of any obvious systemic importance, in the sense that like Long Term Capital Management in the late 1990s, they threaten a cascading series of bankruptcies across the financial system. There is as yet no sign of such a chain reaction. Indeed, but for the  , and the threat posed to the pitifully small remnants of Britain’s once mighty steel industry, Greensill would have struggled to stay in the headlines at all. Archegos may yet turn into something bigger – the widespread dumping of positions to answer margin calls is a classic trigger for wider stock market sell-offs. But again, for the moment, the fallout looks relatively contained, with the damage limited to a number of major banks, all of which thankfully appear solvent enough to weather the losses. There is, however, a common theme to these collapses. Both are the offspring of today’s zero interest rate environment, and the search for yield that it gives rise to. Given the extreme levels of fiscal and monetary support throughout the pandemic, we must assume that Greensill and Archegos are   of reckless lending and finance that has yet to fully rear its head. They may be just the canaries in the mine shaft, with much worse to come as the economy begins to recover. That’s the pattern of the sort of overreach we have seen in financial markets over the past year. All fired up with government and central bank money, they seem to be going for broke. I once had the pleasure of meeting Lex Greensill, then still struggling to make his supply chain finance startup fly. Keen to impress on me the importance of his venture, he billed the company as part of a new wave of fintechs destined to transform finance while at the same time performing the very great public service of providing better access to funding for small and medium-sized businesses. But try as he did to persuade me, I struggled to see the difference between what he was offering and traditional invoice factoring, whereby companies are able to gain early access to the funds owed to them by in effect selling the invoice to someone else. This form of finance has been available for donkey’s years; other than a lot of front, it was hard to see what Mr Greensill brought to the table. In any case, I quickly forgot about what seemed to be just another evident, albeit at that stage, harmless chancer. When a company claims to have reinvented the wheel, it is nearly always a red flag, and so it proved with Greensill. Much the same could be said of Northern Rock, which claimed a whole new funding model for the fiercely competitive and bog standard business of household mortgage lending. That model turned out to be about as safe as a lighted match in a gas works. The demeaning cliché of a wild west-style bank run soon followed, proving yet again that when it comes to the fundamentals of finance, there is nothing new under the sun. Remember Paul Volcker’s observation about financial innovation? The last genuine innovation to come from finance, he said, was the cash machine. For the rest, it’s all just engineering dressed up as something else. As for Greensill, it is hard to see that there was ever really a useful point to its often parasitic existence. A case in point is the logical absurdity of the Pharmacy Earlier Payment Scheme – under which Greensill takes a rate of interest for providing pharmacies with bridging finance between their wholesale purchase of drugs and later reimbursement by the National Health Service. Since the public sector can borrow at rates close to zero, it would have made a great deal more sense, and cost less, if the NHS simply paid its bills on time. In essence, the Government was paying someone to take the risk that the NHS wouldn’t pay. It made no sense at all. Whichever minister originally signed up to this scheme needs to be taken out and shot. When money is cheap and plentiful, even the most seasoned of financial practitioners, desperate for some kind of positive return, are likely to lose sight of underlying credit risks. In echoes of all those British councils that stood to lose money from the collapse of the Icelandic banks during the financial crisis, it appears that German towns have some €600m (£513m) of deposits at risk with Greensill’s German bank. Even the Cologne opera house seems to have bought the script, with €15m of deposits. There are two sides to ultra-low interest rates, quantitative easing, and the kind of fiscal largesse we have seen in play during a year of Covid. One is that it helps riskier players stay afloat, including, it might be said, national governments, which have been able to borrow, spend and invest with nothing in the way of the normal market disciplines to constrain them. The other is that it gives wind to reckless finance and corporate mischief. Government munificence extended to Greensill itself, which used the Treasury’s various Covid support schemes to underwrite hundreds of millions in loans to  . You wonder what other rubbish lies hidden beneath the £75bn of loan guarantees the Government has handed out in the past year. Similarly with Archegos, a US-based family hedge fund which though obviously not the recipient of direct government support, received funding for billions of dollars of share trades from bankers so awash with deposits that they seem wholly to have forgotten the value of money. The justification is that bountiful fiscal and monetary support has helped see the economy through the pandemic storm, insulating it against wider damage. Yet the other side of the easy money environment is that it covers up for a multitude of sins. According to the wit and wisdom of Warren Buffett, it is only when the tide goes out you get to see who’s been swimming with their trunks off. Only in this case, governments and central banks have conspired to keep the tide at the high water mark. Not until the economy recovers, the support is removed, and interest rates begin to edge up again will we get to see who has been swimming naked. Rising bond yields in the US suggest that point may be quite soon. And next time we’re unlikely to be so lucky. Unlike Greensill and Archegos, the coming wave of collapses may indeed be systemically important.",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/antebellum-review-janelle-monaes-time-travelling-slavery-film/,culture,"Antebellum tries to provide a clever, winking twist on the horrors of slavery, which is up there in the Bad Ideas stakes with, let’s say, a first-person shooter video-game inspired by the Columbine massacre. This unholy mishmash of plantation drama and  -esque “gotcha” thriller traffics in self-satisfied provocation, and gets us nowhere. Everything about it is grim, jerry-rigged and unconvincing. The film seems inordinately proud to have found one of William Faulkner’s best-known quotes – “The past is never dead. It’s not even past” – to serve as an epigram, and sticks it up front in a twiddly font, like a pretentious school essay. We begin somewhere in Louisiana at an unspecified date, with slaves in the cotton fields being shot for insubordination. Men in Confederate uniform march around this estate, participating in systematised rape and the branding of people such as Eden ( ), a dazed newcomer fresh off the cart. This first half-hour is all sweat, screaming and kitschy sunsets through Spanish moss, suggesting a horror-show pastiche of 12 Years a Slave with the levels of crass exploitation dialled up. The bombastic use of slow-motion alone should have the film sent to a cinematic-taste tribunal.  Eden is brutalised, and schemes her getaway, but seems trapped in a nightmare. And yet suddenly it’s the present day, and she’s Dr Veronica Henley, a sociologist woken up by a mobile phone ringing. We get 30 minutes or so of this puzzling respite, in which we recognise the face of Elizabeth (Jena Malone) on a Skype call: she’s gone from being the cruel plantation mistress to a malevolent executive with a mile-wide racist streak. It’s hard to avoid spilling the narrative trickery here – and heaven knows, it’s rarely been more tempting to call a film’s stupidity out with unapologetic spoilers. I’ll meet it halfway: it’s clear by the final third that we’ve not been occupying two dimensions, or even two timeframes, just one bird-brained conceit which wants to insist on slavery’s lingering stamp – and fluffs any credible argument it might otherwise have made.  The writer-directors, Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz, don’t miss a chance to point up all the ways in which Veronica, as a successful black woman, is sticking her neck out with critiques of the establishment. But nothing in her predicament evokes the queasy discomfort of   Get Out, which played with forensic skill on the insidious survival of racist attitudes under a smiling veneer of liberal tolerance. Antebellum is slavery as theme park. The final act dumps us right back where we started, only with some deliberately jarring anachronistic clues – a smartphone belonging to the Confederate general – to help connect the dots.  The plotting has a Twilight Zone quality; it needed careful modulation to have any hope of working, but instead it goes for slasher-flick illogic and bungled suspense. One minute Veronica/Eden is buttering her cabin’s latch to make a stealthy escape from her rapist, the next she’s sneaking back in because the general’s phone, which she’s just used to dial 911, needs facial recognition. The film doesn’t make a lick of sense on its own terms, or anyone else’s.  Marooned within it is an enjoyable turn from Gabourey Sidibe, as Veronica’s shameless best friend Dawn. When she zooms off for a raucous night in New Orleans, you’d happily pick up the entire cocktail tab just to hang out with her instead. Meanwhile, scuppered by bad writing and sensationalistic close-ups, Monáe has a series of unenviable tasks masquerading as scenes. The villains are especially laughable: Malone’s lip-smacking Southern-belle depravity is both unseemly and ludicrous.  Amid the Django Unchained-esque reprisals of the finale, which involve dullard officers being burned alive and the use of Robert E Lee’s statue as a skull-crushing implement, finding a wisp of coherent satire is next to impossible here. Antebellum doesn’t so much concertina the past and the present as do a leering jig back and forth, then blow you a callous raspberry instead.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/03/31/five-things-missing-nick-cleggs-defence-facebook/,business,"Sir Nick Clegg is going on the offensive. Facebook's global head of policy and PR, and the former deputy prime minister,   rebutting claims that the company's algorithms are damaging society and usurping human beings' control of their lives. The article explains how Facebook's news feed works, arguing that tech giants must give users more control and transparency over algorithms such as Facebook's. It also exemplifies Facebook's new talking points, which were previously on display in chief executive   and in   designed to help employees to ""go home and have dinner"" with sceptical friends and family. But his lengthy blogpost also manages to avoid certain less favourable issues. Sir Nick spends a lot of time tackling the idea that Facebook divides society, and lists studies that contradict that. ""What evidence there is simply does not support the idea that social media [is] the unambiguous driver of polarisation that many assert,"" he writes. One question: what about Facebook's own research? The past year has seen a trickle of leaks revealing worrying findings from internal studies.  , studying the busiest German political groups, found that 64pc of times when users joined ""extremist"" groups were due to Facebook's recommendation algorithms. In 2020,   found that 70pc of the 100 most active American political groups were ""considered non-recommendable"" due to hate, misinformation and other problems. Some were filled with calls for political violence. A former Facebook AI researcher has also claimed that his team ran ""study after study"" finding that Facebook's algorithms pushed people towards extreme views. ""Over time they measurably became more polarised,""  . Facebook has promised to give outside researchers access to its data. It has not promised to release any of the lessons from its own godlike view of users' online lives. . From a massive inventory of all the content that users are eligible to see, its algorithms assign each item a score representing its predictions about your tastes, and puts the highest scores at the top. Sir Nick is right to point out that this initial inventory is chosen by Facebook users. We decide who to befriend, what to like, which groups to join and which pages to follow. These days, many users are aware that their behaviour influences what Facebook's algorithms will show them. But Facebook's value as a company also depends on retaining control of this process. Algorithmic rankings keep users interested, increasing the amount of available advertising space. They provide continuous opportunities to collect more data, since every response you make teaches the company something about your preferences. Facebook's news feed has been popularity-based by default since 2009 – meaning that it has had 11 years to give users more control and transparency. There is a reason that it has not done so. ""There is no editor dictating the front page headline millions will read on Facebook,"" says Sir Nick. ""Instead, there are billions of front pages, each personalised to our individual tastes and preferences, and each reflecting our unique network of friends, pages, and groups."" This, he argues, is part of the ""magic of social media"", which makes it a revolutionary challenge to the power of old information elites. Yet not long afterwards, he explains in detail how Facebook slashes the ranking of ""problematic"" content, such as news stories ranked false by outside fact checkers, articles that Facebook's algorithms think are likely to be ""clickbait"", and posts from pages and groups that have been repeatedly sanctioned in the past. Later, he talks about Facebook's attempt down-rank political content in news feeds across the world. He describes how it pins ""authoritative information"" about volatile topics such as Covid-19, the US election, climate change and racial justice to the top of people's feeds. He it wants to do this more often in future where it sees a ""clear societal benefit"". So is Facebook an editor or isn't it? The reality may be somewhere in between. But while choosing content via mathematical formulas is not the same as using human editors, it is not exactly people-powered digital anarchy. ""Facebook’s systems are not designed to reward provocative content. In fact, key parts of those systems are designed to do just the opposite,"" Sir Nick writes. There's truth to this. In 2016-18, Facebook was alarmed to find that its data about what users enjoyed was contradicted by surveys and interviews, with users saying that they disliked what they clicked on and felt compelled to act against their real desires. Since then, Facebook has made major reforms that cut engagement or de-prioritised popular content. According to reports, however, Mark Zuckerberg and other executives have repeatedly killed or weakened projects designed to reduce polarisation and political extremism: Sir Nick talks often about the liberating power of the internet, of smartphones and of social networks. In doing so, he frames Facebook's power as inextricable from those technologies, a necessary consequence of epochal social change. ""Even if Facebook ceased to exist, social media won’t be – can’t be – uninvented,"" he writes. ""The human impulse to use the internet for social connection is profound."" Later he warns that this ""dramatic and historic democratisation of speech"" will inevitably ""challenge existing power structures"". Unlike some of Sir Nick's other arguments, this is vintage Facebook PR. It mirrors  , when he accused critics of being on the wrong side of an ultimately empowering revolution. Yet it's striking how many of Facebook's critics are huge believers in digital technology (such as  ) or people who have used it to do good (such as Maria Ressa, founder of the Philippine investigative news site Rappler).  The truth is that Facebook is not the internet, nor is it the only possible form of social network. Nobody doubts the power of online communication: that does not make Facebook itself inevitable.",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/investing/funds/questor-last-chance-saloon-india-capital-growths-managers-have/,business,"Few investment trusts can boast a tripling in their share price in the space of just a year. While   is able to make this rare claim, it has been a rollercoaster ride for investors none the less. Even before Covid-19 sent global stock markets into a tailspin last spring, the trust’s performance had disappointed. The market in which it invests, small and medium-sized Indian stocks, had performed badly, the trust’s own holdings had underperformed this market and the discount had widened substantially. Things then went from bad to worse as the pandemic took hold. While Indian small and medium-sized shares fell by 30pc in March last year,  . This caused its discount to balloon to 42pc in April. With things looking dire, the board gave the trust’s manager, Ocean Dial, 18 months to turn performance around and offered investors the option to redeem some or all of their shares at a maximum discount of 6pc by the end of 2021 and every two years thereafter. As the trust was trading on a 34pc discount at the time, this provided an attractive exit route – and it was for this reason that Questor, which had initially tipped the trust in March 2017, advised readers not to sell. The good news is that, 10 months on, the outlook for India Capital Growth is looking brighter. Performance has turned around: the underlying portfolio has returned 93pc over the past year, according to Numis, the broker. What’s more, the discount has narrowed to 12pc. This can be attributed to a repositioning of the portfolio and a rebound by the Indian stock market since the country came out of lockdown last June. Since then, the economy has continued to show signs of recovery and has remained open. Even in light of the trust’s improved performance, Daniel Lockyer, a fund manager at Hawksmoor Investment Management, said he believed it had further to go. “From here I expect to see some great opportunities because the economic conditions are positive,” he said. “The population has largely escaped the worst of Covid: although India still has a lot of cases, the deaths and restrictions are less than in many other countries. The government has put in a very stimulative budget and corporate earnings are also positive and growing nicely.” Mr Lockyer also highlighted the potential gain on offer if investors chose to participate in the share redemption at the end of the year. “Ideally we want the share price to go up to the net asset value, but even if it goes the other way you still have a 6pc margin of error from where we are today,” he said. This could present adventurous investors with an opportunity to make money in nine months’ time. However, given how much India Capital Growth’s discount has narrowed over the past 10 months, it would be remiss of Questor to describe it as a screaming buy. We'll stick with a hold rating. Investors in   received 12.5pc of their investment back at near par value in early February – not a bad outcome given that the trust was trading at an 11pc discount at the time. The redemption was under the trust’s policy to repurchase shares when assets exceed £100m to retain a focus on Britain’s smallest listed companies. This policy can be seen as both a blessing and a curse. If the trust is trading at a premium you will be forced to sell your shares at a lower price and there are potential tax implications too. However, while the trust trades at a discount there are opportunities to benefit from an uplift: and it would appear that another return of capital could be on the cards in light of the fund’s strong recent performance. Over the past six months alone the underlying portfolio has gained 39pc. A spokesman for N+1 Singer, the trust’s broker, said the board had historically returned capital when assets were in the £115m to £120m range. With gross assets close to £115m, he said another redemption looked likely if good performance continued. As the trust trades at a 7.5pc discount, this presents an attractive support for the valuation. ",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/31/london-ride-blank-cheque-investment-wave-rules-rethink/,business,"The City watchdog is preparing to throw open the door to the ""blank cheque"" craze sweeping US and European markets in a major shake-up of London's listing rules.  The Financial Conduct Authority said it was proposing to ease rules that act as a major barrier to special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs) listing in the UK, as part of the Government's push to make the London market more competitive.  Under existing rules, Spacs – shell companies that list on a stock exchange with a promise to swoop on a takeover target – are effectively impossible to engineer in Britain due to rules that force these cash shells to suspend their shares in the event of a reverse takeover.  However, as part of new proposals which are expected to be introduced by the summer, the FCA said it will no longer require Spacs to suspend their listing when they announce an acquisition. London has missed out on the Spac boom which has swept Wall Street and Amsterdam, raising $83bn (£60bn) last year alone.  These vehicles have surged in popularity in recent months, attracting the likes of musician Jay-Z, NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes, former Credit Suisse boss Tidjane Thiam and former politician Paul Ryan.  Earlier this week, British used car site Cazoo agreed to be acquired by a US Spac, valuing the company at £5bn. The move by the FCA comes after Lord Jonathan Hill recommended that the UK follow other countries by loosening rules on Spacs in a landmark review earlier this month. Charles Howarth, a corporate partner at law firm CMS, said: ""The whole point of investing in a Spac is that change, from a cash shell to a trading company, and suspension under the current listing rules just adds insult to the injury caused through lack of an ability to redeem shares or vote on the acquisition. ""Removing the suspension requirement and providing for a shareholder vote and redemption rights would make Spacs a rather more attractive prospect on the London market."" However, there are concerns that London might already have missed the Spac boom as the market has slowed in recent week amid  . An index of Spac listings has fallen by about a fifth since its February high. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said the Government is determined to enhance London's reputation among investors now the UK has left the EU.  Lord Bellingham, a Tory peer and executive chairman of fintech payments group Sokin, said: ""We are very pleased to see the FCA moving fast, and with a short timescale, to look at Spacs in the UK.  ""The announcement of the FCA consultation comes on a day when we have seen Deliveroo shares fall sharply on opening which also shows the importance of the Hill report in creating the right listing environments for fintechs, as well as investors."" The consultation will be open for four weeks and the FCA aims to bring in new rules or guidance by early summer.",4

An EU diplomat said: “You can’t just put the UK and Switzerland in the same box as China and Iran”.  Most member states are against excluding Britain from the partnerships between universities and companies, which the commission proposal said was needed to “safeguard the Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy, or security”. The countries raising concerns include Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Ireland, Poland, the Netherlands and the Baltic states.  Commission officials were said to be impervious to protests from some member states, which highlighted the need to continue partnering with traditional, trusted allies at a recent meeting to discuss the plans. A further meeting is scheduled for April 19.  European universities were also appalled by the decision.  “The latest proposal by the European Commission to exclude longstanding and trustful partner countries like Switzerland, Israel and the United Kingdom from parts of the research programme is not in the interest of Europe’s research community nor the wider society and could be damaging for the international co-operation,” the Eurotech Universities Alliance wrote in an open letter.  “The commission is pulling the rug from underneath fruitful collaborations that need to stay on the carpet,” the diplomat added.  The hard line position is understood to come from Thierry Breton, the French Internal Market Commissioner.   Brussels is pursuing an initiative called “strategic autonomy”, a push designed to bolster the bloc’s ability to defend itself from competition from the US and China.  Britain is one of more than a dozen fee-paying non-EU countries that expected to be involved thanks to their associate membership of the seven-year Horizon Europe programme, which is expected to begin issuing grants in the coming months.  EU labs and universities also risk losing existing partners. There are up to 20 quantum projects in Israel involving the EU. ",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/31/deliveroo-debacle-embarrassment-london/,business,"So much for full throttle, more like choke. For all the talk of motoring onto the London Stock Exchange, Deliveroo hasn’t just hit the skids, it’s swerved across several lanes of traffic during rush hour, collided with the central reservation and scattered the contents of its takeaway boxes over morning commuters.  Deliveroops, Floperoo - take your pick of the uncharitable barbs.  , equivalent to more than £2bn in market value, are a disaster, not least for the 70,000 customers thought to have gobbled up £50m of shares set aside for a retail offering.  Spare a thought too for our dear Chancellor, persuaded to endorse the company as “a great British success story” while trumpeting London as “one of the best places in the world to start, grow, and list a business”. After his public support for Asda too, a seal of approval from Rishi is already starting to look like the kiss of death. Deliveroo's float will go down as one of the worst debuts that a major company has made in years - the equivalent of a takeaway order arriving cold, an hour late, and looking nothing like the picture on the website - even after lowering the offer price to the very bottom of the range.  Still, if the shares of any company were going to be wildly overpriced, it’s surely the one where you can pay £10 to have a poorly paid, overworked bike courier ride all the way across London to deliver a flaccid sandwich to the comfort of your desk. A steward’s enquiry will begin in earnest as to how a company with the supposed   of the City, including the usual battalion of investment banks, lawyers and public relations advisers on the ticket, could get such a high profile float so spectacularly wrong.  After all, it was only on Tuesday, one day before the float, that spinners for Deliveroo were insisting that it had seen “very significant demand” from investors and the share offering had been covered “multiple times”. As markets analyst Neil Wilson points out: “The books were covered, it was just plain mis-priced.” There’s enough lessons for Deliveroo’s circus of overpaid cheerleaders, led by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, to learn to last a seven-course banquet. There were the usual red flags: existing venture capital backers dashing for the exit; unrealistic price expectations; and an avalanche of overblown hype from a PR machine that went into overdrive, orchestrating a farcical love-in from the great and good of the Square Mile.  Why settle for Chancellor of the Exchequer when you can also get the boss of the London Stock Exchange David Schwimmer; Lord Hill, fresh from his recommendations on how the City can woo more technology companies; Ron Kalifa, founder of Worldpay, and one of Europe’s most successful technology entrepreneurs; plus other luminaries to provide anodyne quotes for the big press release? All that was missing was a double-thumbs up from the Pope on the front of the prospectus. The timing was off too - not only did it look like those involved were trying to bring the company to market before lockdown ended and growth inevitably slowed, but it also coincided with a damaging   over treatment of workers that has obvious implications for Deliveroo, despite its claims to the contrary.  In many ways, the listing should have been a slam-dunk: a British entrepreneur, floating a British company, in Britain not New York or another overseas exchange, and not just any company but one with claims to be an innovator and a disruptor. What better advert for Global Britain?  Only no amount of marketing, good intentions, or hope could mask the underlying problems of a heavily loss-making business operating in a highly-competitive market with an uncertain route to profitability at best - convenience food and subscriptions are unlikely to be a path to riches.  The software economics of food delivery are unfavourable - more orders means more riders, which means more costs. The political risk is huge too. Keir Starmer may have all but disappeared out of sight but it’s probably fair to assume that there will be a government one day that is more sympathetic to worker rights. And the City has already decided it doesn’t like the gig economy model. Nor did it help that in Will Shu, Deliveroo has a robotic founder unable to act as a convincing salesman for the company’s prospects.  But even those concerns are secondary to the suspicion that Deliveroo is basically just a food delivery company and not the next sophisticated technology champion to come out of Britain.  Shu may rue his decision to choose London over New York but he shouldn’t. It’s unlikely to have been a different story. America is more friendly to tech entrepreneurs but investors are still questioning: shares of Deliveroo rival DoorDash have plunged by a quarter since its December listing. If there’s anything to take from this, it’s that markets have shown that even when it comes to technology companies, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. There are two ways to interpret a multi-million pound fund-raising from pubs operator Fuller, Smith and Turner. There’s the glass half empty response that investors gave to a £53m placing which knocked its shares as much as 3pc at one stage, though just 1pc by the end of the day. ""Alongside a sobering set of financial results, shareholders are being asked to help the chain navigate the   until pubs can open their doors properly to the public again. Four fifths of annual turnover was wiped out last year, and it has been burning through between £4m and £5m for every month that the beer taps have been shut off.  It’s a reminder, as if one was needed, that the hospitality industry has felt the full force of the pandemic and been hit disproportionately hard by muddled government restrictions. Fuller’s pubs will have been closed on nearly three quarters of the days between 30 March last year and 12th April this year, when outside drinking is permitted. Yet boss Simon Emeny is taking the glass half full approach. Yes the company is burning through cash, but the money it is raising is to spend on training additional staff so it can take full advantage of an expected sales surge once the shutters come up. Though he describes the last 12 months as “the most challenging” in Fuller’s 175-year history, Emeny says Fuller is ready to “capitalise on the opportunities” and expects to be cash flow positive again by the middle of May. He’s bullish about the vaccine rollout, staycations, and even weddings.  Emeny reports “pent-up demand” and predicts “customers are eager to return to pubs”, which sounds like the understatement of the century. My guess is that there won’t be a beer garden in the country that isn’t full next week, even if the weather is a let down. Even   might not be as damaging to trade as expected. In an Ipsos Mori survey of more than 8,300 people aged 16 and over, 62pc of respondents said they would be fine with a “papers for pints” policy despite all the ethical, legal, and practical issues it would throw up. Emeny’s optimism bodes well for the hospitality industry and the wider economic recovery too. We should all drink to that.",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/03/31/forget-deliveroo-ex-woodford-pick-real-gem/,business,"It's been among the most heavily hyped UK floats for years, but when investors took a first nibble of Deliveroo shares on Wednesday they promptly vomited them up. With shares in the takeaway delivery firm  , the float has left a nasty mess in the lap of founder Will Shu and an army of City advisers on the Deliveroo gravy train. The   shouldn't come as a surprise, however. Shareholders have been anxious over Deliveroo’s lack of a clear path to profits while a recent   over the status of gig economy workers hardly helped shore up confidence in its business model.  Either way, Deliveroo’s gruesome market debut was a world away from the frenzied float of US rival DoorDash, whose shares surged 86pc on its first day of trading. Nor will it do any favours for Rishi Sunak’s ambition to build a thriving home-grown tech sector and steal some of the action from Wall Street for the London Stock Exchange. That seems a shame, especially as a far more appetising meal is now looming up on the horizon in the form of  , the genome sequencing firm spun out from Oxford University that unveiled plans for its own UK float later this year on Tuesday. Analysts believe the two companies could both be valued at several billion pounds, but the similarities end there. Unlike Deliveroo – a popular consumer brand with an easily replicable business model –   built on innovative research-based science rather than bicycle home delivery of kebabs, burgers and pizzas.  Its decision to list in London is great news for the life sciences sector and a real opportunity to build a domestic technology champion.  Founded by Dr Gordon Sanghera in 2005, Oxford Nanopore is in many ways the perfect business for our times. A manufacturer of miniaturised equipment used to decode the DNA of any organism – from humans to viruses. Over the past 12 months Oxford Nanopore has surfed a wave of new business linked to the pandemic.  From Brazil to China, scientists have turned to the group’s devices to trace mutations in coronavirus – a process made possible by their speed, portability and low cost. Fifteen years ago, the cost of sequencing a human genome stretched into the hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Today, thanks to advances in the technology achieved by Oxford Nanopore and other experts in the field, that figure has crashed to £700 or less. In turn, the technology is opening up a host of new commercial opportunities, from medicine to drug development, food safety monitoring and agriculture. Oxford Nanopore’s decision to plump for a UK listing rather than following the likes of WeJo and Cazoo in a convoy of deals to head across the Atlantic is encouraging news for the UK technology sector. It’s not just the fact that the company could be valued at up to £7bn, making it one of the biggest UK floats of the year. Genetic sequencing is an area of expertise where the UK has always excelled, and remains a world leader – so it’s great news that UK investors will share fully in the company’s journey and future growth prospects. This is exactly the space where Britain needs to build home-grown champions for the future. Big investors include Britain’s IP Group, Schroders, Lansdowne and Odey Asset Management – although another high-profile UK asset manager, Neil Woodford’s Equity Income Fund, sold off its stake to Acacia Research in a cut-price sale of its assets. Oxford Nanopore’s biggest rival is Illumina, a San Diego-based company listed on Nasdaq worth more than $53bn, underlining the potential that exists in this booming industry.  Oxford Nanopore’s fortunes were transformed by the pandemic. The company, which had revenues of £52m in 2019,  secured a £113m government contract for Covid testing last year. It also stands to benefit from international efforts to establish a more effective virus monitoring system to ensure there is a better framework for coping with any future outbreaks.  The company’s close ties to Oxford University, and to big contracts from the Government, probably helped to shape its decision to stick to a London listing. But there are other factors as well. Having left the EU, Britain now has a real chance to build up its life sciences industry through regulatory divergence.  By reducing red tape around emerging technologies like gene editing and diverging from strict EU controls, the success of home-grown companies like Oxford Nanopore could play a vital role in the drive to build industries of the future. That’s why Oxford Nanopore rightly deserves robust support from the UK Government. It’s unlikely to all be plain sailing however. Like many areas of life sciences which rely on intellectual property gleaned from academic research, genome sequencing has become a bitterly contested and highly litigious area. With tens of billions of pounds in potential future revenues at stake, Illumina and Oxford Nanopore have clashed swords before in disputes over their technology. They may do so again with each other or with emerging rivals, potentially posing a risk for investors. Meanwhile, floating on the London Stock Exchange will not shield the firm from potentially hungry foreign predators. None of that should detract from the enormous potential of promising British firms like Oxford Nanopore. While Deliveroo looks like a flop, there is no reason for investors to view all UK tech listings in the same way.",4

Ms Coates' salary of £421m is equivalent to £1.3m a day. It was topped up with a £48m dividend payment from her 50pc stake in the business. The payout marks a fresh record for the gambling tycoon and is believed to be the largest wage in British history. It comes close to matching the £466m paid to FTSE 100 bosses in 2019, according to research by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, and eclipses the previous record  , the former boss of Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who paid himself £343m last year. The package also dwarfs the earnings of American executives such as Apple boss Tim Cook and JP Morgan head Jamie Dimon, who picked up £97m and £23m respectively in 2019. Ms Coates bought the bet365 web domain from eBay and began running her company from a Portakabin in Stoke two decades ago. She owns the company alongside her brother John, co-chief executive, and father Peter who is a significant donor to the Labour Party. Bet365 paid a total of £615m to HMRC for the year, cementing the Coates family’s position as Britain’s biggest taxpayer. It also donated £85m to charity.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/04/01/home-workers-get-done-pandemic-study-finds/,business,"Homeworkers banished to studies and spare bedrooms did not suffer a productivity slump at most firms after Covid hit - with a third of businesses even finding they could get more done, according to new research. A report by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) found that remote working did not cause a fall in productivity at 71pc of firms, suggesting many could make the shift permanent after the crisis ends.  Productivity actually rose at a third of companies, the CIPD said. The findings will add to growing evidence that the pandemic has permanently upended working patterns at many offices as staff enjoy more time at home without having to commute, and businesses seek to cut rental costs.  Accountant PwC became the latest business to announce a long-term change this week, unveiling plans to give employees Friday afternoons off this summer and the choice to work more from home post-pandemic.  It will also let staff pick their start and finish times, but said employees will be expected to spend 40pc to 60pc of their time in the office or at clients' premises. The homeworking revolution threatens to transform many industries and shift demand from city centres in a potential major blow to the economy. The CIPD survey found that just under two-thirds of businesses intended to embrace a ""hybrid"" working model after the pandemic by combining time at home and in the office.  Employers said the biggest benefits of home working are an end to to the commute and improved wellbeing for staff who have grater flexibility. However, businesses added that there is a risk staff could become isolated in a serious challenge for mental health. Charlotte Gascoigne, who wrote the report, said: “When combined with the benefits for staff well-being, and the potential savings to the employer in office costs, it’s perhaps not surprising that many interviewees had changed their mind about homeworking. “The pandemic has shifted perceptions even among those who were previously suspicious of homeworking.” However, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane have raised concerns the economy could suffer if staff stay at home. Mr Haldane warned last October that remote working could dampen the creativity and innovation usually sparked in offices. He said: “Homeworking can starve us of many of these creative raw ingredients - the chance conversation, the new person or idea or environment. “Homeworking means serendipity is supplanted by scheduling, face-to-face by Zoom-to-Zoom.”  Chancellor Rishi Sunak also raised concerns over a permanent shift away from physical workplaces in an interview with the  last week. He said: “You can’t beat the spontaneity, the team building, the culture that you create in a firm or an organisation from people actually spending physical time together.""

The fund that was supposed to save Europe is in suspended animation.  If the European project ever unravels it will probably because of a ruling by the venerable  . Each time its interventions become a greater threat. You can stretch the EU treaties and Germany’s Basic Law only so far. The normal etiquette is for the judges to issue polite requests to the German president whenever required. This time they time issued an order. Their hackles are up. The court was irritated by attempts to rush through German assent for  , an instrument that allows the European Commission to raise serious money for the first time on the capital markets. It gives Brussels a giant slush fund to play with, and it changes the constitutional order. The judges told him to withhold assent for the financing mechanism until they have reviewed a complaint by Germany’s tireless eurosceptic professors. The case could take months, possibly years. The final ruling may kill off plans to create federalist eurobonds by the back door.  It may also thwart efforts to turn the fund into a permanent EU ‘fiscal entity’, the disarming term for smuggling through an economic union, with pooled debts and a European treasury. It would eviscerate the Bundestag and national parliaments without having to put the matter to national referenda.   If the court finds in favour of plaintiffs, Southern Europe  . One can no longer rule out debt restructuring of systemic scale, either conducted in an orderly fashion within the euro, or in a disorderly fashion that breaks the euro,  .  The former would require more foresight and statecraft than Ursula von der Leyen has shown so far. Her reflex would be to prohibit investors from selling their bonds in self-protection. She would try to blame it all on “speculators”. Professor Bernd Lucke, the key litigant in the new case, told me Europe’s politicians are exploiting the pandemic to push through the next leap forward in the Project. “They are abusing the crisis to reshape the EU into a transfer union. Once they open that door, nobody will ever be able to close it,” he said. The   set off a minor earthquake last May when it ruled that the European Central Bank  , beyond its treaty powers. The ECB was no longer conducting monetary policy. It was engaging in disguised fiscal rescues under the cloak of QE bond purchases. This left German citizens on the hook for liabilities of unknown size without the democratic assent of the German parliament. The row was defused with a fudge. But the judicial warning could not be ignored. The court has constrained the ECB in critical ways. A perennial bailout is no longer possible. Markets are betting that the new case will be fudged as well. They assume that the judges will wink at creeping fiscal federalism, after some faux protest. That may happen. But this case enters more dangerous legal waters for the EU project.  “You can’t extrapolate anything from previous cases. Those were about monetary policy and the ECB, which is designed to be an independent institution. That is completely different from fiscal policy,” said Prof Lucke.  “It is a core principle of our constitution ( ) that fiscal policy stays under the control of the German parliament,” he said. Legislative power over tax and spending is the lifeblood of democracies. It was an attempt to circumvent Parliament that led to the English Civil War, a point made by Otmar Issing, the ECB’s founding chief economist. He has since turned against monetary union, calling it a “house of cards”. Prof Lucke's case invokes Article 311 of the Treaties. It states that the EU’s policy objectives “shall be financed wholly from own resources”. Under normal practice, each member state is liable only for its share of debt issuance when backing EU schemes. The Recovery Fund entails unlimited liability. If one EU state defaults on its share of the debt, the remaining members have to pick up the tab. You can easily imagine a domino effect  .  “What really worries me is if a country leaves the EU. It would no longer be legally liable for Union debt,” said Prof Lucke. Europe’s leaders have unwittingly created a device to explode their own project.  They have raised the incentive for countries to leave in future episodes of stress, with a first-mover advantage. These states would not be in the same position as the UK under Article 50: facing an inflated divorce bill set by Brussels. “Their negotiating position would be stronger,” he said. Veteran litigants are split on the likely outcome of this case. “The German elites will never give up the mad project of the euro. They will defend it like the Eastern Front,” said Gunnar Beck, an EU law professor and an MEP from the   party.   Prof Beck said the court is as ideologically besotted with EU federalism as the rest of the German establishment. “The judges are very political and they will just ignore the law as always,” he said. Political risk group   thinks the court will let the Recovery Fund go ahead but will constrain its reach and prevent it from becoming permanent. If so, this has consequences. We can debate the theoretical limits to sovereign debt in a currency union, where exchange rate risk is converted into default risk. What is clear is that the shock of Covid-19, on top of Europe’s lost decade,  . The Commission expects debt to peak at 122pc of GDP in Spain, 127pc in Portugal, 159pc in Italy, and 194pc in Greece, but that was before the Covid third wave wrecked the second quarter and threatened the summer season.  Italy’s low growth trend makes it nigh impossible to bring such a debt ratio back under control, and when Italy goes, so do others. The ECB is for now soaking up the debt and masking the problem. That becomes harder to justify once inflation picks up, even stretching the definition of monetary policy. The next line of defence is the Recovery Fund, and market assumptions that it will be expanded over time, morphing into a debt union. As long as that belief holds, debt ratios hardly matter. The German credit card will take care of all.  Markets know the fund is supposed to be temporary, a one-off emergency to cover the pandemic. It must be wound down later. Europe’s constitutional structure must return to the  , meaning a treaty club of sovereign states responsible for their own debts rather than a proto-federal state.  Bond investors in Frankfurt, London, New York, and Tokyo do not care. They think the EU will always find some way to finesse the Treaties, whatever the legal text actually says.  None other than German vice-chancellor, Olaf Scholtz, called it Europe’s “Hamilton Moment”. He was evoking American fiscal union in the 1790s - a bailout of bankrupt states by Virginia, the Deutschland of the day. But Mr Scholtz blew the game. A Hamilton Moment tramples all over the German constitution. His words will be thrown back at him.   The   may now be forced to kill off European fiscal union whether the judges like it or not.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/21/reverse-ageing-britain-ease-pressure-public-finances/,business,"Scotland is attempting to turn back the clock to save its economy. With an older population and a far lower fertility rate than the rest of the UK, Scotland risks becoming the country’s ageing epicentre. Mortality, fertility and migration was the three-pronged approach targeted in Holyrood’s first population strategy last week as it battles to de-age its workforce. Like much of the developed world, policymakers in Edinburgh are threatened with a fast ageing population that will slash the workforce, drain public money and spark a social care crisis. Scotland’s new strategy warned that an arsenal of weapons rather than a “silver bullet” will be needed as Covid worsens the problem. Widened access to pricey fertility treatment, incentives for families to set up in Scotland, and encouraging older people to   were among a package of measures proposed. But can such policies do enough to reverse the ageing of Britain’s population? While the extension of life expectancy has been a major medical achievement, it is causing headaches for economists. “A lot of people are really underestimating how massive the changes are in the demographic outlook for pretty much every country in the world,” says James Pomeroy, HSBC economist. “Over the course of the next decade, it will be the fastest pace of change of demographics globally that we’ve probably ever seen, and we’ll ever see, because we’re at this turning point.”  from being a tailwind for many economies to a major headwind as populations age. Developed economies will see their working age population shrink, but their older cohorts expand rapidly as the large baby boomer generation retires and lives for longer. The huge increases in life expectancy is a key driver of ageing populations, but economic forces are also at play. “The point about low wage jobs, low productivity [and] jobs with low social status is that it means often that people struggle to start families,” explains prof Adrian Pabst, deputy director at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). “Families either get delayed or never happen at all because they simply cannot afford it… wages are a huge area of concern here.” An ageing population means slower GDP growth, but higher public spending and a smaller tax base. Population is an important driver of economic activity with gains creating a larger workforce and consumer demand. “Scotland’s business base, the domestic customers that provide them with demand, and the workforce required to supply that demand are all derived from its resident population,” the population strategy explained. The Scottish government expects to suffer “significantly lower” increases in GDP than the rest of the UK because of its weaker population growth, while Japan’s shrinking working force   as labour shortages bite. A declining workforce means a smaller tax base that will struggle to raise enough revenue to pay for  . A worker aged 45 in the UK on average provides the most tax revenue to the state and takes out very little in public spending. That switches when that worker becomes elderly as their pension, social care and health costs sap money from the state. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that age-related spending is set to climb from 23pc of GDP in 2025 to 26.2pc in 2065, a rise sharper than any of the eurozone “big four” of France, Germany, Italy and Spain. A typical UK 89-year-old in 2021-22 is estimated to cost the state more than £30,000 a year, while the 45-year-old costs just £6,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. “The British state is changing shape to respond to pressures from the ageing boomer cohort,” warns Lord Willetts, the president of the Resolution Foundation’s intergenerational centre and a former Conservative minister. “What you see is an increase in NHS spend and an increase in pension spend.

But paying for an older population will likely mean Britons face  . “In the absence of any other change, it’s hard to see where else it could come from,” warns Pabst. He says the alternative is an insurance system that workers pay into, helping to cover care costs later on in life. Like many of the economic challenges facing policymakers, the pandemic threatens to amplify the problem. A  , with estimates suggesting that Britain’s birth rate may have fallen to record lows. HSBC believes the pandemic could mean the global population peaks a decade earlier than previously expected in the early 2050s, with huge implications for economies. The UK is still far from the full-blown population crises facing the likes of Japan. It remains middle of the pack in terms of fertility rates among developed economies, but will still endure huge population pressures. Pomeroy predicts the UK’s working age population could be declining this decade and will “certainly be shrinking in the 2030s”. If the UK’s fertility rate fell from its current level of 1.7 births per woman to around 1.2 or 1.3, levels currently seen in Spain and Italy, the population would almost halve by 2100 if there was no immigration, he estimates. “It actually could happen, these demographic risks are so underestimated,” Pomeroy warns. There are solutions that could at least cushion the economic blow, but they are unpopular, slow and long-term. Politicians have largely preferred to kick the can down the road than grasp the nettle. The easiest and quickest solution is to raise the retirement age, delaying the point that state pensions kick in and encouraging people to work for longer. More office-based employment and improving health makes extending working lives more viable, but it is fiercely unpopular. The UK’s state pension age will rise to 67 later this decade, while retirement age increases in other countries have knocked governments’ popularity. “You could just reduce the value of state pensions or not increase it so rapidly,” adds David Sturrock, economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. He warns the current “triple lock” that ensures pensions increase by the highest of earnings, prices or 2.5pc is “unsustainable” in the long term. Boosting immigration levels to bring in young workers that start families could also ease the pressure. While many developed economies face shrinking workforces, populations in many parts of the world are still growing rapidly. “Nigeria, Egypt, Philippines [and] India - these countries have got very fast growing populations,” says Pomeroy. “Migration could be theoretically a global solution, but as we know, that isn’t necessarily practical or politically popular in various parts of the world.” The holy grail for policymakers would be reviving fertility rates, but reversing decades-long trends could prove difficult. Boosting the number of births per woman would lift the number of young workers entering the labour market and widen the tax base to ease the pressure on the public finances. Economists argue that reducing childcare costs and bolstering the financial security of younger generations are vital in lifting births. “You really need to incentivize people and make the costs lower, which is what generally happened in Scandinavia,” says Pomeroy. With Scotland’s low fertility rate of 1.4, its new strategy included several measures to shore up young families. More affordable homes, support packages for families settling in Scotland, and expanding fertility treatment to groups such as single people and couples who already have a child are proposals being drawn up to de-age the population. Scotland is taking the first step towards solving its brewing population crisis but policymakers may need to be far more ambitious to turn back the clock.",4

Speaking to the BBC’s   programme, the industrials entrepreneur warned of the dangers of creditors filing winding up petitions in court against his businesses, which include the UK-based Liberty Steel operations. Mr Gupta said: “It makes no sense for them to destroy jobs but more importantly to destroy value because that is the value which will give them their recovery.” He was speaking after Credit Suisse, a major investor in Greensill, pushed for Citibank, which provides administrative services for the Swiss group, to   against GFG’s Liberty Commodities trading unit. It is understood that more petitions are likely against other parts of Mr Gupta’s sprawling GFG empire, which employs 5,000 people in the UK, more than 2,000 of them in its steel divisions. GFG has been teetering on the brink of collapse since the  , which provided Mr Gupta with billions in controversial supply chain funding. Mr Gupta added: “In this situation it is natural some degree that lenders want to protect their own position but we also have our position – we have committed facilities from Greensill for three years and according to us these debts are not due.” He said his companies “continue to have positive discussions” with Greensill administrator  Grant Thornton about a standstill agreement to give GFG breathing space.  Mr Gupta defended his use of Greensill and supply chain financing to  , describing the lender as a “breath of fresh air” several years ago when he started snapping up distressed industrial assets as he built up his empire. He said: “At the time when Greensill came to give us funding it was a breath of fresh air because they believed in our business model. “We have bought plant after plant which was either shut or shutting. In those situations you cannot access normal, conventional funding.  “Without the help of Greensill we would not have been able to build this business.” Mr Gupta said his business was in the process of refinancing to more conventional funding before the current crisis engulfed it, but added that Greensill “helped us not to have those plants shut down but rather to have them turned around. In some ways at that time there was no choice.”  Despite the current troubles, Mr Gupta said that “most of our operations in the UK and the world are very good plants and doing extremely well”. He said he was getting a “huge amount of interest” from new financial backers, and was confident in the future of the UK steel industry, calling it a “labour of love”. “Our overall global  operations are profitable, we have refinancing offers, we will refinance and we will support our UK business also. None of my steel plants will be shut down under my watch, for sure.”",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/classical-music/classical-fans-rest-easy-antonio-pappano-will-equal-simon/,politics,"So it’s farewell and hello to Sir Antonio Pappano, 61, who will leave the Royal Opera House in July 2024, and two months later will reappear, phoenix-like, as the new chief conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. And it’s bravo to the LSO, for snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. In recent months, things have looked gloomy for an orchestra that has always ridden high. Of all Britain’s orchestras, it is the one that comes closest to American-style glamour, with its big-stage spectaculars, its fabulous shiny sound, and its habit of bagging the biggest-name soloists and conductors – Previn, Davis, Tilson-Thomas, Mutter, Gergiev, Rattle. The pandemic, however, not only caused immense harm to the LSO’s finances – as with every other orchestra – but saw it suffer two further body-blows. One was the resignation of its current music director, Sir Simon Rattle, who pleaded a desire to be closer to his family in Berlin, but  . Then, last month, came the announcement that the Centre for Music, a proposed new concert hall and music-education centre where the LSO would have been resident,  . Rather than licking its wounds quietly, the orchestra has now seized the initiative by swooping on one of the world’s few bankable  . This new appointment is a brilliant move: it brings a new chief conductor who yields nothing to Rattle in terms of stature and authority, and whose confidence in front of television cameras, revealed by shows such as Opera Italia, will be an asset. Pappano is a very different musical personality to Rattle, more exuberantly warm in his nurturing of a long lyrical line, as opposed to Rattle’s inimitable combination of fastidious attention to sonority and visceral excitement. The only potential downside is that Pappano doesn’t share Rattle’s passion for new music, but this is a role the LSO’s impressive roster of guest conductors could take on. Will Pappano’s arrival bring a change of emphasis, perhaps more vocally-centred music? “Well, I have plenty of ideas for repertoire, I’m making copious lists,” Pappano tells me from Rome, where he’s been conducting a season of online concerts with the other institution he directs, the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia – a job he relinquishes in 2023.   “And yes, you’re right, I’m thinking about vocal music, but all these decisions are done in partnership with the orchestra so I can’t say anything yet. ""I feel this tremendous chemistry with the LSO, I've been so thrilled with the 70 concerts I've done with them,"" he adds. Now, without an opera house and another orchestra to run, he'll be able to ""nurture"" that chemistry. ""I'm looking forward to being bowled over yet again by their incredible energy,"" he says.",1

Hunter Biden, the president’s second son, has opened up for the first time about his decades-long struggle with alcohol and drugs and how his father helped him on his path to sobriety.  The 51-year-old tells how his first drink was a glass of champagne aged eight, leading to a lifetime of abusing drink and then hard drugs. “I’ve bought crack cocaine on the streets of Washington, DC, and cooked up my own inside a hotel bungalow in Los Angeles,” Hunter, whose mother was Mr Biden's late first wife Neilia, writes in the prologue to “Beautiful Things,”  “I’ve been so desperate for a drink that I couldn’t make the one-block walk between a liquor store and my apartment without uncapping the bottle to take a swig,”  “In the last five years alone, my marriage has dissolved, guns have been put in my face, and at one point I dropped clean off the grid, living in $59 (£43)-a-night Super 8 motels off I-95 while scaring my family even more than myself.” The situation became so bad he even let a homeless addict he bought crack from move in with him. He tells how he was in and out of rehab in his 20s and relapsed after seven years, effectively ending his lucrative lobbying career. Hunter returned to rehab in his 40s, before relapsing again in 2016 after his older brother Beau died of cancer. His father, who was then US Vice President under Barack Obama, arrived at his home and said, “I know you’re not fine, Hunter. You need help.”  Hunter recalls: “He grabbed me, swung me around and hugged me. He held me tight in the dark and cried for the longest time. He never let me forget that all was not lost. He never abandoned me, never shunned me, never judged me, no matter how bad things got — and believe me, from there they would get much, much worse.” Private videos and emails from Hunter’s laptop were leaked to the press last year, when Mr Biden was campaigning for the 2020 election. Hunter insists he is now sober, and credits new wife Melissa Cohen and their young son for his sobriety.  ",0

The US president on Wednesday said the upgrades will generate millions of jobs, revitalise the US economy and  ""It's a once-in-a-generation investment in America, unlike anything we've seen or done,"" the president said at the launch of the first stage of his Build Back Better programme in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Putting infrastructure at the centerpiece of the president's economic agenda, it calls for the injection of $620 billion into transport, including upgrading 20,000 miles of roads, repairing thousands of bridges and doubling funding for public transport. Mr Biden plans to pay for his proposal by raising corporate taxes and taxes on high earners. ""No one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up, period,"" Mr Biden said to a crowd at a carpenters training facility.

Mr Biden said the goal was not to ""target"" the wealthy but to address divisions and inequality worsened by the pandemic. The plan would spread the cost for projects over an eight-year period and aims to pay for it all over 15 years, without adding to the country's debt in the long run, a senior administration official said.

However, it was removed shortly after.  Facebook permanently banned Mr Trump from its platform in January after the US Capitol riot, “due to the risk of further incitement of violence.”  Mrs Trump, who was this month announced as a contributor on Fox News, shared an email with her more than one million followers from Facebook explaining the social media company's decision. “We are reaching out to let you know that we removed content from Lara Trump’s Facebook page that featured President Trump speaking,” the email she posted stated. “In line with the block we placed on Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts, further content posted in the voice of Donald Trump will be removed and result in additional limitations on the accounts,” the message stated. Sharing screenshots of the emails, Mrs Trump, 38, wrote: “And just like that, we are one step closer to Orwell’s 1984. Wow.” Her husband, Eric, also shared the post on Instagram, writing: “This is so horrible – what is our country becoming?”  In a statement to The Telegraph, Facebook confirmed it had taken the clip down, saying: “As you know, President Trump is indefinitely suspended from Facebook and Instagram.” The spokesperson confirmed it would not be removing news coverage of the former president. Critics on Wednesday criticised the decision, calling it an affront to free speech. “Big Tech’s war on conservatism and all things Trump needs to stop,” tweeted Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator. “Now, @Facebook has decided @LaraLeaTrump cannot interview her father-in-law. Who makes these decisions? The liberals running Big Tech.” Senior Republicans have led a charge against Silicon Valley in recent months, accusing its executives of anti-conservative bias and demanding that Congress strip them of their legal protections. In his first one-on-one televised interview since leaving office, Mr Trump spoke about the possibility of running for president again in 2024, as well as railing against President Joe Biden's green agenda and “cancel culture”. He claimed the media’s treatment of him, as compared to his successor, which he said showed a “new phase” in the “woke left’s” cancel culture where journalists refuse to cover certain subjects for “political reasons”.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/non-fiction/mistake-remainers-make-british-empire/,politics,"Telegraph readers might be inclined to overlook Empireland because it’s praised on the cover by Lefty shock jock James O’Brien (death by endorsement) but, trust me, it’s better than that. The subject is timely. With statues being tossed in rivers and the  , it feels as if the Right regards the past as the repository of civilisation and the Left sees it as a closet packed with skeletons of dead racists, but the reality of the British Empire, says Sathnam Sanghera, was infinitely more complex. It was acquired, as Sir John Seeley famously described it, “in a fit of absence of mind”. Far from a coherent project, let alone a conspiracy, Sanghera calls it “unplanned” and “nebulous… it was never a legal entity, and had no constitution or emperor issuing top-down laws”. It was also controversial in its own time. When Robert Clive, the man credited with laying the foundations of the empire in India, died in 1774, he was buried in an unmarked grave; his crimes had been so great, said Samuel Johnson, that his conscience compelled him to cut his own throat. , now sitting in our museums, were recognised by contemporaries for what they were: booty. At the conclusion to the Mahdist War (1881-99) in East Africa, the Mahdi’s tomb was raided and his skull presented to Lord Kitchener as a gift, who toyed with turning it into an “ink stand or drinking cup” before depositing it with the College of Surgeons, an episode that Queen Victoria regarded as embarrassingly medieval. Throughout the 1846-7 Xhosa War in South Africa, “heads were taken and traded as souvenirs”. There were imperial projects of enlightenment and improvement, yes, and many Britons so fell in love with cultures they encountered that they “went native” – for good and ill. By the 1880s, almost half the British troops in parts of Bengal had an STD. One British officer, far from the embodiment of the “stiff upper lip”, attempted sexual intercourse with literally everything he encountered, animal or mineral, including “a papaya, which proved more satisfying than a melon”. I am sold on the larger part of Sanghera’s thesis, that the empire could be rotten and we don’t know enough about it. I’m not sold on the claim that no doubt attracts O’Brien, that . Brexit, Remainers often say, was informed by a myth of British exceptionalism, that because we once ran large parts of the world, we thought we didn’t need Europe and could go it alone. To prove this, the author quotes a lot of Boris Johnson, an admirer of Churchill who recites Kipling, but the PM is the product of a very unusual public school education – and Brexit was made possible by the support of the working-class, many of whom have never travelled further afield than the Costa del Sol. We are invited to swallow the paradox that the general public are simultaneously ignorant of empire and obsessed with it. If we are uneducated – and a lot of what Sanghera documents is news to me – then I’d add that there’s a lot that defines us that we don’t know about, such as the Vikings, the civil war or the Wycliffe Bible. Historical amnesia is not limited to the long 19th century. But the Left focuses on that period, with some justification, because modern Britain emerged from the twin experiences of industry and colonisation, hence empire speaks to our contemporary concerns around class and race. We are, as Sanghera notes, a multicultural country thanks to empire, yet the empire was also “a wilful, unapologetic exercise in white racial supremacy” that dehumanised black people “on a super-industrial scale”. Whites were persuaded that they were top of the food chain and had a God-given right to be in charge – yet also, when the colonised began to migrate here, vulnerable to invasion. Travel beyond the playing fields of Eton, however, and you’ll find that many people voted for Brexit not to run the world but step back from it, to work on unfinished business back home. Granted, a lot of far-Right boobs backed Brexit, but so did plenty of moderates, some socialists and a roughly a quarter of non-white voters. If they wanted to turn the clock back to any particular moment, it was probably the 1950s, to an imagined time of safe streets and strong communities – to welfare state Britain, not the buccaneering British Empire. A far greater shadow is cast over the present by the Second World War, which is popularly remembered not as a defence of empire (which it was) but as a fight for democracy against fascism – against imperialism, if you will. Sanghera’s point, I guess, is that we are unconscious citizens of Empireland: empire made us, whether we realise it or not. He might be correct, but no one likes being told “I know you better than you know yourself”, and I suspect that the reason why many take offence at the attempt to “decolonise” high streets or the school curriculum is not because they are protective of empire but because they see it as an attempt to politicise their culture and daily life. They also suspect that history is being invoked to compel us to think or behave a certain way, that because Britain is guilty of crimes in the past, we must shuffle into the future with an embarrassed air, perpetually voting for whatever liberals want, to prove that we aren’t as bad as our ancestors were. The history is on Sanghera’s side. The facts speak for themselves. But just as the history of empire cannot be reduced, like Sanghera insists, to simple binaries of good vs evil, nor can the dynamics of historical memory. ",0

Greaves was a leading dissident as Steel formed the Liberals’ alliance with the SDP, and broke with Steel’s drive for a merger after the 1987 election – though he soon became a Liberal Democrat himself. He was among the severest critics of  ’s efforts to develop close ties with New Labour. Ashdown described one party policy session in 1998 with Greaves at full throttle as “probably the worst meeting I have ever attended”. Greaves was convinced, from the outset, that Clegg’s coalition with David Cameron was a “bad idea”, saying no-one had had time to think the implications through. He stood for Parliament three times, but his strength was as a counterweight to Westminster. As secretary up to 1985 of the Association of Liberal Councillors, and subsequently the guru of local political activism, he was consistently suspicious of policies – and deals – hatched in London. In Colne, Greaves was respected across the party divide for his commitment to the town, and his encyclopaedic knowledge of the Pendle district. One fellow councillor described him as “a force of political nature”. Anthony Robert Greaves was born in Bradford on July 27 1942, the son of Geoffrey Greaves and the former Moyra Brookes. From Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, he read Geography at Hertford College, Oxford, then taught at Colne Grammar School. Greaves made his mark at the 1970 Liberal Assembly, introducing the motion that committed the party to “community politics” – campaigning on the doorstep to secure initially small improvements that mattered to local people. He served on Colne council (and its successor, Pendle) from 1971, and from 1973 to 1997 was also a county councillor. He fought Nelson & Colne at both 1974 elections, and Pendle in 1997. Editing the party magazine New Outlook, Greaves backed Steel for the leadership against John Pardoe. But he made Steel’s life uncomfortable as secretary of the Association of Liberal Councillors, then as a member of the party’s policy machinery who had started his own publishing house (he was later a second-hand book dealer). When Steel moved to merge with the SDP, Greaves was initially one of the Liberals’ negotiators – but pulled out of the team just before it concluded the infamous “dead parrot” policy document on the merger negotiations. From 2000 he brought to the Lords a whiff of social activism, and to the parliamentary party a resistance to reforms by Menzies Campbell and, subsequently, Clegg. In 2013 he aroused controversy by making light of accusations by four Lib Dem women of sexual harassment from his fellow Lib Dem Lord Rennard, writing: “We don’t know the details, but it is hardly an offence for one adult person to make fairly mild sexual advances to another. What matters is whether they are rebuffed. If the allegations as made are a matter for resignation, around a half of the male members of the Lords over 50 would probably not be seen again.” He later accused the complainants – who by then had left the party – of “a deliberate vendetta” against Rennard. Greaves was vice-president of the Local Government Association, and the Open Spaces Society. In 1988 he published, with Rachael Pitchford, Merger: the inside story. In 1968 Greaves married Heather Baxter, who survives him with their two daughters.",0

Robert Rowland has been described as a “larger than life character” who was “enthusiastic” in his opposition to the European Union. The former politician and fund manager died yesterday near his family home in the Bahamas, according to a statement issued by Brexit Party founder Mr Farage. The Royal Bahamas Police Force reported that a man had been found on the seabed during a fishing trip aboard a 39-foot boat off the Caribbean islands on Saturday afternoon. A police report has stated that a member of the party spearfishing in the area of tourist destination Exuma Cays did not resurface. Mr Rowland represented the party as an MEP for South East England from 2019 until the constituency's abolition when the UK exited the EU on January 31 2020 “It is with great sadness that I have to announce the death of Robert Rowland, after a diving accident near his home in the Bahamas,” Mr Farage said in a statement through Brexit Party successor the Reform Party. “Following a successful career in the City, Robert was an enthusiastic Brexit Party MEP and larger than life character. “On behalf of myself, and all those who were involved with the Brexit Party, I extend our sincerest condolences to his family”. Mr Rowland was married to wife Lisa Marie, and had four children. Police on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas are investigating the incident After studying at Newcastle University, where he was first introduced to political activism, he worked in the financial sector with several asset management companies. He was elected with a number of colleagues in 2019 as Mr Farage's party won 29 seats in the European elections. Former Brexit Party colleague David Bull told the Daily Express: ""Robert was the kindest, most gentle, thoughtful friend. He was deliciously funny, dry, intelligent, erudite and compassionate. ""He was a huge support to me in the European Parliament and when I was campaigning in the General Election. “He was a true team player. We started as colleagues and ended up as the closest of friends.” Alongside his political activities Mr Rowland also supported Tickets for Troops, a military charity offering free tickets to music, sports, and entertainment events to members of the Armed Forces.

It was normal for everyone to behave appallingly all the time – hard drinking, hard smoking, loads of recreational drugs. This was the time Mayfair started to become cool again,” says one executive. “Mayfair was a total backwater.” But what is considered cool one decade is less so in another. The small number of women who worked in finance during those years do not look back fondly on the “good old days” of a gilded era. “Women being humiliated in this country is part of upper class culture,” says one senior businesswoman who has bad memories of that time. “These are ruthless people who are part of a ruthless system which is there to deny people their economic freedom.” One of the biggest characters from the buccaneering late 1990s and early 2000s is  , once dubbed one half of the “Posh and Becks” of the City and a regular at celebrity Mayfair members’ club 5 Hertford Street. After making £220m on the night of the Brexit vote with a bet that markets would fall, the Brexiteer turned to an Italian proverb to express his delight the following morning. “Il mattino ha l’oro in bocca” – the morning has gold in its mouth – he told the BBC. But much of that glow has since come off his fortunes.   and in the past few months he has been battling   dating back to 1998. He was   earlier this month, with district judge Nicholas Rimmer questioning why he had been charged after a decision not to prosecute him was overturned by a victim review. The woman claimed   put his hands on her breast and up her skirt before she “wrestled herself free and left”. Odey said he propositioned her after he “misread the signals” but did not grope her. New allegations have since surfaced. Last week Bloomberg News reported accusations of inappropriate behaviour from two unnamed sources, a former receptionist at his firm who claims Odey used to run his hand down her back when she was at work and a former client who alleges she was asked by Odey to be his mistress in exchange for the use of his flat during a business dinner over a decade ago. Odey’s spokesman says he denies all the allegations and will be instigating legal action against them. The claims nevertheless shine a spotlight on Britain’s hedge fund industry during an era of excess. One senior businesswoman says she feels the Mayfair set will always bat away claims of sexism and harassment simply as “a lunch gone wrong”. Odey admits that he may not have noticed the cultural changes going on around him in recent years as the male-dominated finance sector finally began to modernise. He is known throughout the Square Mile as one of the last of a City old guard fond of a long lunch. At one midweek meal with an   journalist, he paired steak and kidney pudding and mash with a “side order” of a loin of beef and two bottles of wine. “Things change, if you’re running a business for 30 years you sometimes don’t see how much the world is changing culturally. There is a bit of   in that,” he says. “There are definitely improvements we can make in our culture. [But] what we do in our private life does not affect our professional life. It’s a point of view.” Despite being acquitted, now aged 62 the financier faces having to rebuild his reputation. In the secretive hedge fund industry, reputation is everything. The amount Odey personally manages shrank to around $777m (£558m) at the end of last year, according to an investor letter seen by Bloomberg. Odey Asset Management, the company he founded in 1991, even changed the name of around £1.3bn worth of funds from “Odey” to “Brook” in the weeks before he was acquitted. Odey claims his business has been unaffected by the court case. “At the moment everyone wants to kill Odey but we have a resilient brand,” he argues. “I’ve had all the diversions of this court case, and all the kiss and tell stories, but we’re having a fantastic time across the board – our funds have grown by 30pc this year”. His male supporters – including one who recalls watching him get slapped in the face at an event – argue that nobody should be judged in this “intense, really sensitive climate” for things they did decades ago. “Now he seems like a figure out of time,” one said. “People flourish in different ages.” Robin Birley, the owner of 5 Hertford Street, insists his friend has never been banned from the club despite rumours that he was not seen there for some months in 2014 after being caught in a compromising position by a member of staff. “Crispin is both a personal friend and a valued member of 5 Hertford Street. “There is no truth at all in the claim that he has ever been banned from the club,” he says. Odey told the   in 2014 that the incident was a “joke spread by a friend”. Odey Asset Management’s website – which shows an all-male research team, male-only portfolio managers (of which half are also Oxford graduates) and just one woman on its management team – suggests it remains a relic of a bygone era. Many hope the hedonistic boys’ club where wealthy financiers such as Odey once felt so at home will finally begin to change.",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/26/eu-still-has-gun-table-wont-pull-trigger/,politics,"European Union leaders have left the gun of a vaccine export ban on the negotiating table with Britain but they don’t want to pull the trigger in case they shoot themselves in the collective foot.  The heads of state and government of the remaining 27 member states held a video summit on Thursday night to discuss stricter export controls on coronavirus vaccines.  , a slow vaccination rate and huge shortfalls of supplies of the AstraZeneca jab. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president,  , which allows Brussels to stop exports to countries, like the UK, with higher vaccination rates than the EU and low exports to it. France, Spain and Italy wanted the biggest stick to wave at Britain possible, while Germany, Belgium, Ireland, and the Netherlands were worried about triggering a vaccine trade war.  Britain exports raw materials to the Pfizer factory in EU member Belgium, which could be at risk if the EU blocked vaccine supplies to the UK.  The European Council was too divided to agree to explicitly support the new rules in their summit conclusions.  This makes little difference legally because the rules had already entered into force through a commission implementing regulation. It could be quashed by EU member states over the next fortnight but it won’t be. It is politically significant. Mrs von der Leyen (below) will think twice without the support of her masters in the Council and they have made clear she is not to put supply chains at risk.  Mark Rutte of the Netherlands said he hoped the new rules would never be used.  The gun on the table may not have a full chamber but it is still loaded.  AstraZeneca, which Brussels accuses of breaking its supply contract with the EU, and by extension Britain is not off the hook.  Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Mrs von der Leyen were clear.  “Companies have to honour their contract to the European Union before they export to other regions in the world. And this is of course the case with AstraZeneca,” said Mrs von der Leyen, before adding the firm would have to “catch up” before it could export outside the EU. The commission has already threatened to block shipments of the Oxford University jab to the UK from AstraZeneca’s Halix plant in the Netherlands.  It wants Boris Johnson to drop the British first refusal on jabs manufactured in the two UK AstraZeneca plants so they can begin supplying the EU, which is foreseen in Brussels’ contract with the pharma giant.  Brussels says this is a matter of fairness because EU-based factories have exported so many vaccines to the UK. UK-EU negotiations are underway and will continue in the coming days.  The EU’s gun may not be quite as large as Mrs von der Leyen would have liked but it could still blow a hole in Britain’s vaccination rollout.  The commission has briefed member states that Britain is hugely dependent on EU supplies for the second phase of its vaccination programme.  Since December, Pfizer has sent the UK 20m doses. A further 1m came from AstraZeneca.  Just under 29m people have had their first jab in Britain. That suggests about 8m jabs in the UK were made in Britain or imported from suppliers outside the EU, which is by no means enough to fill a continental sized hole in imports.  The UK will struggle to vaccinate the rest of its population  , ensuring they are fully vaccinated, without EU supplies.  About 2.5m are fully vaccinated with a second dose, leaving about 26m people at risk of not being fully inoculated against coronavirus.  France’s foreign minister held up the EU’s gun this morning. He said the UK’s first dose policy, in which as many people were jabbed as quickly as possible meant there were no stockpiles reserved for second shots.  Jean-Yves Le Drian, France's foreign minister, said “Europe does not have to pay the price for this policy.” The UK-EU talks are the first since Britain left the transition period to not directly concern Brexit.  EU leaders have made clear their preference is for a deal rather than a trade war.  Unless the UK has a secret second shot stockpile stashed away somewhere, Boris Johnson may be forced to to find the least embarrassing way to give the EU what it wants.  That is likely to be an agreement to share supplies from the Halix factory and possibly, at a later date, from the two British-based factories as well.  That compromise will be far simpler to swallow once more and more people are vaccinated and more supplies come on stream in the coming months.",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/16/red-wall-by-election-fight-keir-starmer-hartlepool-mp-resigns/,politics,"Sir Keir Starmer is set to face the first test of his leadership at the polls in May, after a Red Wall MP stood down on Tuesday following sexual harassment allegations. Mike Hill, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, resigned his seat weeks before an employment tribunal is to hear sexual harassment and victimisation allegations against him. His departure will trigger a by-election in one of the Labour Party’s most vulnerable seats, which Mr Hill retained with a significantly reduced vote share at the 2019 election after the chairman of the Brexit Party stood against him. The by-election could see Paul Williams, another Labour Red Wall MP who lost his seat in 2019, take on the Conservatives and Richard Tice, now chairman of the rebranded Brexit Party, Reform UK. Mr Hill was suspended from the Labour Party in September 2019 over sexual assault allegations, but readmitted after his accuser’s complaint to the party was “parked”, pending the outcome of an investigation by Parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Process. An employment tribunal for sexual harassment and victimisation will begin at the London Central Employment Tribunal on May 10. Mr Hill strongly denies the allegations. It is understood that he met with Nick Brown, Labour’s chief whip, on Tuesday morning and made the decision to resign. The by-election in Hartlepool is expected to take place alongside the local elections on May 6.  The Telegraph understands the leadership of Hartlepool’s local Labour association is planning to install Mr Williams as their candidate for the by-election on a single-candidate shortlist. Mr Williams is currently the Labour candidate for Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) in Cleveland, but plans to stand instead for the Hartlepool seat in an attempt to return to Parliament. He was previously the MP for Stockton South. The secretary of the Hartlepool Constituency Labour Party, Anth Frain, has written to other members to express concern that choosing Mr Williams, a moderate candidate, without a full selection process will be seized upon by hard-Left Labour members as a fait accompli by allies of Sir Keir. Mr Frain has privately warned senior figures in the CLP that hard-Left members will have to be reassured Mr Williams was the choice of local members rather than Sir Keir’s office. Labour’s vote share in Hartlepool dropped by almost 15 per cent at the 2019 election, following a surge in support for the Brexit Party candidate, Mr Tice. Mr Tice now leads Reform UK, the Brexit Party's successor, and told The Telegraph he was ""actively considering"" standing again. ""We've obviously got some big decisions to make and a lot depends on when the by-election is,"" he said. ""I'm the only one that stands for cutting taxes for the least well off and the lowest paid amongst any of the parties. I think actually there's a very clear agenda that works for the people of Hartlepool."" Mr Tice said if he did decide to stand, the Conservative Party should withdraw their candidate to increase his chance of beating Labour. ""The Tories should say: 'No, Richard, you stand, and let's damage Keir Starmer',"" he said. ""That puts Labour in a right pickle."" A Tory source responded: ""[Tice] doesn’t care about the people of Hartlepool. All he cares about is climbing the political career ladder.” The Conservatives finished second at the last election, but have opened up as the odds-on favourites at 1-2 to win the by-election. Labour are 13-8 to retain the seat, according to the bookmaker Coral. A Labour Party spokesman said: “Mike Hill has resigned as Member of Parliament for Hartlepool with immediate effect.”",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/27/exclusive-britain-tell-brussels-astrazeneca-jab-would-not-exist/,politics,"Britain will this week tell the European Union that it must take into account the millions of pounds spent by British taxpayers on creating the AstraZeneca vaccine as   remains. Talks to break the stand-off over jabs  , will resume as early as Monday.   The European Commission has threatened to   because British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has fallen far short of its contracted deliveries to the bloc.   Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, last week   after she disclosed that factories in the EU had sent 21 million jabs to the UK since December but received none in return.   The UK-EU negotiations will focus on defining what ""reciprocity"" means, whether it would include finished vaccines or their ingredients and whether and how a deal would take into account investment in vaccine development.   British officials will argue that the EU has benefited from £84 million in funding for the manufacturing for the AstraZeneca jab, developed by scientists at the University of Oxford. Without this cash, the UK will say, there would be no vaccine at all.   The UK is pushing for Britain's per capita investment to be part of the calculations because it is a single country rather than the 27 member states of the bloc and so has proportionately invested more than some individual EU nations. According to the Government's recent spending review, it has paid more than £6 billion in total to develop and procure Covid vaccines.   The UK also exports raw materials to the Pfizer vaccine plant in Belgium. It plans significant increases in research and development, with almost £15 billion in 2021-22 including funding for clinical research to support delivery of new drugs, treatments and vaccines. Maros Sefcovic, the commission vice-president, told The Telegraph that investment in development would be one of the factors taken into consideration when evaluating reciprocity. The commission does not see reciprocity as being based on a simple dose-for-dose formula, not least because it is a major manufacturing hub for the jab. One diplomat said he was not surprised by the British demand, saying it ""seemed fair"". But the source warned that the EU would also want German investment in the development of the Pfizer jab to be taken into account.  ""And how do we subtract the European investment in Halix? And the advance purchase agreement of the EU for the production of AstraZeneca vaccines that never came about?"" the diplomat said.",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/31/vaccine-passports-unworkable-illiberal/,politics,"Now perhaps you've just read the headline to this piece and you're thinking; gosh, I agree with the Lib Dems. I'm also surprising myself: I agree with Michael Gove. Not the Michael Gove currently leading the charge for Covid ID cards within the Government. But a slightly younger, more liberal Michael Gove who, years ago, during the debate over Labour's ID cards, noted (and I paraphrase): ""In human history we see that laws that are brought in during an emergency are scarcely ever abandoned by government."" Mr Gove, please, for the sake of traditional British freedoms, spend a bit of time with your former self. But it's not just Gove. I was deeply alarmed when we heard   - essentially, Covid ID cards - are being considered for use in the UK. They are illiberal, unworkable and would be utterly ineffective in keeping people safe from Covid. As the party of civil liberties and personal freedoms, the Liberal Democrats rejected Labour's attempted introduction of ID cards under Tony Blair. We see no reason now why we should accept the vaccine ID cards of Michael Gove and Boris Johnson. With ID cards, the Prime Minister of ""levelling-up"" fame would be the creator of a new two-tier society. People who have not been vaccinated could become second-class citizens, unable to access the freedoms allowed to their friends and family who have been inoculated. Around this time last year, we took a difficult decision due to Covid: we came together as a country and agreed to suspend many of our fundamental freedoms with lockdowns and social distancing. These were the only weapons we had to stop the spread of this lethal virus: we rightly did everything we could to slow its spread. But as we transition out of lockdown a year on, and begin reopening our economy and society, all our freedoms must be restored, in full, as soon as it is safe to do so. We must open up as equals, as one country. The Government's plans for Covid ID cards  . They would hit our pubs and restaurants with a sledgehammer, at a time when the focus should be on recovery. The costs of checking the ID cards on the door and of security to remove those without them would create an unfair burden on an already struggling industry. And no vaccine has yet been authorised for use on children and adolescents, while some people cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons. What use is a vaccine passport if it doesn't allow us to go out for a meal with our loved ones? It is simply mistaken to believe that vaccine passports will allow us to open up our economy and society faster. Other countries have not needed such restrictions to open up. Why should it be different in the UK? We have seen from Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand that it is possible to lift lockdowns without such draconian measures - because they had low case numbers and a functioning track-and-trace system. We all know that Boris Johnson is a fan of grand projects and easy fixes. But surely, by now, even the Prime Minister must have learnt that there are no quick and simple routes out of this pandemic. Mending the systems we have in place may not be glamorous. It won't make for exciting headlines, but it would save lives and allow us to begin to open up. So we must not let this Government patch over the cracks in its test, trace and isolate system with bureaucratic and invasive Covid ID cards. We must not allow it continued control of people's lives long after the need is gone. Effective testing and tracing and proper measures at our borders, combined with a proper self-isolation system, all supported by the success of the vaccination rollout, is the way out of the pandemic. It is clear that better days are now ahead. But separating society into haves and have-nots will not end this pandemic. Robust public health measures and working together will. We must get all our freedoms back, together.

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/31/landmark-report-racism-should-clear-way-realistic-debate-inequality/,politics,"Since the Black Lives Matter protests last year, an unflattering picture of Britain has been painted. Britain, we are told, is institutionally, systemically and irredeemably racist. Racism lurks in our education system, in our workplaces, in our culture and even in our unconscious thoughts. To live as an ethnic-minority Brit is to be subjected relentlessly to discrimination, prejudice and violence from all quarters.  But   challenges this doom-laden view. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, set up by the Government, presents almost the polar opposite of the dominant narrative: that Britain is not the apocalyptic wasteland of racism it is made out to be, but is in fact a ""beacon"" and a ""model"" for other white-majority countries. Racism exists, it says. And we are not yet the ""post-racial society"" that we should aspire to become. It also acknowledges that some communities are ""haunted"" by historic racism. But it also finds no evidence of ""institutional racism"". The language is important here. As Tony Sewell, the commission’s chair, explained on the BBC's Today programme, words like ""institutional racism"" have become ""catch-all terms"" to explain every disparity between different ethnic groups. But proof that racism is the driver of these disparities is rarely offered.  Education has been a key area of success for Britain’s ethnic minorities, and it is also where claims of ""institutional"" racism start to unravel. The report finds that ethnic-minority children tend to do just as well or better than the white majority. Black Caribbean pupils are the only group to perform less well, but it makes no sense to blame this on racism. Year on year, the data have shown girls of African origin to be among the top-performing groups. Does anyone really believe that British racism is so sophisticated that it marks out one set of black students for failure and another for success? Clearly, there is more to this than skin colour. As for employment, the report finds the ethnic pay gap has shrunk to 2.3 per cent. Even better news is that it is barely significant for employees under 30. No doubt older ethnic-minority workers, who were born or arrived in an overtly racist Britain, will have been denied opportunities for advancement in the past that still have an impact on them today. But the future is much brighter for the next generation.  As soon as we understand that race does not, thankfully, play a large role in these disparities anymore, that’s when a more productive debate can begin. The report, for instance, highlights social class and family structure as two possible drivers of inequality. The two are not mutually exclusive, of course, as more secure working conditions and higher pay make a stable family life more likely.  But class is the divide that the uber-middle-class world of think tanks, academics and NGOs producing endless reports of systemic racism really don’t want you to think about. Their accusations of racism are a way of closing down debate. They allow self-declared race experts to tell everyone to shut up and listen to them (and pay them handsomely for their time, too). The saturation of the ""Britain is racist"" message has consequences, including for ethnic-minority Brits. A close friend of mine, a mixed-race woman who works in a PR company, has been bombarded with endless diversity schemes and empowerment sessions since  , and more recently since the murder of Sarah Everard. The depressing message she gets from her woke employer, she tells me, is that ""the world hates me because of my skin colour, and every man I know wants to kill me.""  The Commission echoes this warning in its report. ""The more things that are explained as a result of racial bias"" it says, ""the more it appears that society is set against ethnic minorities, which in turn can discourage ethnic-minority individuals from pursuing their goals"". This is the last thing any anti-racist should want to happen. Let’s hope this report opens up a more balanced – and realistic – debate about inequality in Britain.",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/03/31/city-starting-give-eu/,politics,"Okay, let’s not get carried away. The news that the UK and Brussels are   is, of course, to be welcomed. But it’s probably a touch early to break out the bunting and start organising street parties.  The two sides have finalised the contents of a   that should lead to the creation of a “joint UK-EU financial regulatory forum”. That’s even less exciting than it sounds. It’s not so much a deal, more the establishment of a new talking shop.  Whatever your view of Brexit, there can be little debate that the best trade agreement for the City of London was the one that it had before the UK voted to leave the European Union: full access to the single market and an outsized say in the shaping of its financial regulations. As of now, there are certain services that UK-based firms are simply not allowed to provide European clients.  The new “deal” is therefore a bit like suspending all the Eurostar, Eurotunnel and ferry services between the UK and the continent and then laying on a few replacement pedalos. Actually, that’s not quite right. It’s more like agreeing a quorum to timetable future discussions on the feasibility of introducing pedalos at an as yet unspecified date. This is the point we have reached. Since the referendum, expectations about the kind of deal the Government would be able to secure for the financial industry have gradually dwindled to almost nothing. The City has at least become inured to disappointment: it expected little from the Christmas Eve Brexit deal and got even less.  Most firms were ready. They started preparing for a hard Brexit as soon as they heard the referendum result in 2016. As the head of the European operations of a US investment bank said to me: “I was upset by Brexit when it was going to cost me a lot of money. But now that I've spent it, I don’t really care.” Indeed there are a growing number of voices in the financial industry suggesting that the UK probably shouldn’t even bother   - the last great hope for the City’s future relationship with the bloc. That’s because, whisper it quietly, equivalence is pretty rubbish too.  For starters, it is not, as is sometimes assumed, a single catchall solution. Equivalence, where firms are granted access to a market because the regulatory regime in their country is considered comparable, applies in about 40 different areas, each of which would potentially have to be separately negotiated and agreed. The EU has, for example, already granted equivalence in clearing for 18 months. The UK will probably be able to push for equivalence in less contentious areas like data uniformity and insurance. It would be nice to get it for equities and derivatives trading venues. But don’t hold your breath on that one.  What’s worse, in asking for equivalence, the UK would effectively be signing up to EU financial rules without having any say in shaping them. That’s fine right now as the UK and EU regulatory regimes are basically identical. But it would prevent the UK from diverging in any meaningful way over time, thus undermining one of the stated rationales for Brexit. Indeed, the EU has already demanded the UK map out its future regulatory plans as a prerequisite to any possible agreement. However, the single biggest problem with equivalence is that it is granted unilaterally. It is not a deal; it is the EU’s gift. And what Brussels giveth, Brussels can most certainly taketh away. Why on earth would the UK agree to having a sword hung over its most important industry?  All of which is why Philip Hammond, when Chancellor, described a third-country equivalence regime as “wholly inadequate” for the scale and complexity of UK-EU financial services trade. He argued it was “never meant to carry such a load”. He was right. It could be argued that equivalence is better than nothing. And it has certainly been used by other “third countries”. The US, for example, has cleared euro-denominated derivative trades on such a basis for years.  But that arrangement works because it so clearly benefits both sides. The relationship between the UK and the EU is manifestly more antagonistic and will likely remain so for years to come. The Bank of England this week raised concerns that European regulators are asking financial firms to relocate more jobs and operations to the continent than are strictly necessary from a prudential perspective. Trust is in pretty short supply right now.  What's more, the EU has reportedly said it is in ""no hurry"" to grant equivalence. The longer the UK spends on a doomed mission, the less time it will have to focus on other opportunities.  Over the past 15 years, the EU’s share of global financial activity has shrunk by a third and been overtaken by Asia in almost every sector, according to New Financial. The think tank has forecast Asia’s share of global finance will rise from 30pc in 2018 to 54pc in 2040. This is one area where the City should be looking for new customers.  The UK, along with the US, specialises in the kind of cross-border financial business that might most appeal to them. The two countries account for about 70pc of all global derivatives trading, for example. This is one area where the City should be looking to help shape global financial standards.  Hammond pooh-poohed equivalence because he was angling for a closer relationship along the lines of “mutual recognition”, whereby the UK and EU would jointly determine their rules were robust enough to allow two-way access. That hope proved forlorn.  But equivalence also prevents a closer relationship with other markets. It would place the City in a kind of regulatory limbo - neither in nor out of the single market.  If that's all there is on offer, then it’s looking increasingly like any form of financial services deal between the UK and the EU - beyond a regular catch up and chat - is a complete non-starter.  Time to move on.",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education-and-careers/2021/03/31/school-children-pimlico-have-gone-strike-furious-right/,politics,"At a London secondary school,  , pupils went on strike Wednesday. Ostensibly they were protesting their head teacher’s new strict uniform policy  of others and colourful hijabs. It was quickly all over social media: a peaceful sit-down protest against a policy which was clearly discriminatory. There were reports that a senior member of staff had asked pupils to cancel the action the day, but that the children had refused to attend lessons alongside some of their teachers, who have since then handed in their resignations. A storm in a tea-cup? Hardly. More like another frustrating incident which black and Asian families recognise only too well. Rules that apply to one part of the community but not to the other (white) part.  So perhaps it’s not surprising that the highly anticipated  which is due, has left a bitter taste in our mouths. In the foreword to the 264-page report, which was published on Wednesday, chairman Tony Sewell rightly points out that there are “snowy white peaks” at the very top of the private and public sectors of society. He also acknowledges that it comes at a pivotal moment for our nation’s race debate in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, but the independent review concludes that the UK should be seen as an international exemplar of racial equality and there was no evidence “of actual institutional racism”. So why then are young people like the children at Pimlico still left with no choice but to protest?  Could it be the way the government downplays these issues, suggesting the well-meaning “idealism” of young people, who claim the country is still institutionally racist, is not rooted in substantial evidence.   When the problem seems to many to be systematic, ingrained, and more comprehensive than it’s made out to be, who is right? As a result of the report, the Commission announced 24 recommendations to forward four overarching aims: To build trust between different communities and the institutions that serve them, to promote greater fairness to improve opportunities and outcomes for individuals and communities, to create agency so individuals can take greater control of the decisions that impact their lives, and to achieve genuine inclusivity to ensure all groups feel a part of UK society.  But, unless the black and Asian community are confident they are being believed, isn’t this just another form of lip service to the lives and experiences of those affected by this nature of injustice? Back in Pimlico, the tension was building before today. At the weekend, some pupils sprayed white graffiti across the school walls - since removed. There had been calls for the academy’s new principal designate, Daniel Smith, to be removed, and criticism about the Union flag that remains permanently erected outside the school. The graffiti read: “Headmaster Smith should get the sack!”, “Ain't no black in the Union Jack”, “White schools for brown kids are u mad” and “Pimlico Academy...run by racists...for profit!!!” “We believe the school has unfairly targeted groups of students,” one pupil told the Guardian. “The school should protect marginalised races, religions and other groups instead of targeting them. We should see ourselves and our backgrounds represented in our studies. “There have been a lot of changes recently. Previously, Pimlico may not have been the best school but we were represented and we felt we were heard when we raised issues but now that’s not the case. The flag has become a symbol of us not being listened to. It’s strange but it feels like we are being colonised.” Pimlico may feel like a one-off flashpoint but we ignore events like this at our peril. Young people will have gone home tonight feeling frustrated and ignored.  I think students will be learning the hard way that this country often prioritises its international reputation on the world stage, whilst simultaneously allowing a myriad of racial disparities in education, social mobility, health and the criminal justice system, just to name a few, explicitly to persist. Treating people with respect, acknowledging a person's basic dignity, having empathy for every person's life situation, listening to other opinions and validating their contributions in the world shouldn’t be up for debate 400 years after the transatlantic slave trade, but unfortunately, it still is. Labour MP David Lammy said it best: “Like so many in Britain’s black community, I’m tired! Tired of the endless debate about whether structural racism exists with little desire to actually address it. We are being gaslighted.”  It's hard to disagree.",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2021/03/31/china-using-mass-surveillance-impose-will-violate-norms-privacy/,politics,"Internet 2.0 relies on open sources to collect data and other cyber information. With this latest case study we have an unprecedented view on how  . The size of the Chinese surveillance state is immense in scope and ambition. We often view it as a complete unit, inscrutable and impenetrable. However, having been built in a hurry, and at large scale, it suffers from insecurity. The Government of China for its part takes comfort in the protection of the Chinese language, treating it almost as a form of encryption and ignoring the large digital exhaust its rapid efforts to build surveillance systems has left behind. This is a privacy issue for their citizens but also foreigners who visit China and are caught up in their all-inclusive surveillance systems. The system is centered on Shanghai and includes multiple feeds from the city’s systems. From this we can conclude that their ability to capture and process data, particularly facial recognition and technological interception is likely ahead of some of their rivals. We can also see how China blurs the boundaries between law and order, counter-terrorism and political crimes. Within this system there is limited restraint as all are collected on. Of note the vast majority of those tracked by technological interception within the counter-terrorism system are of Uyghur ethnicity. As credible journalists are slowly ejected from China, open-source intelligence may well become the best means through which to study China and its surveillance state. Data is as important as eyewitness accounts because on aggregate it paints a detailed picture. As a primary source for research there is no bias needed to be considered and can be sometimes as good as video and photography. Some of these feeds we consider more benign systems. These include tracking volatile chemicals, drug precursors and common criminals. However, mixed in with this data are espionage cases, defectors and protesters. One of the key differences between China and western intelligence collection is that the barrier for being categorised as a terrorist within this system can be very low and appears to be closely tied to ethnicity. The system’s providence is easy to establish. The data has been verified with real identities of those tracked. We have worked with an international consortium of journalists to interview several people being collected on. The feeds themselves are easy to attribute as they contain the names of the sources such as the Public Security Bureau. The cameras have been identified and charted to their precise locations and the links between this system and others are digitally visible in the links within the data. Within this system also sits non-trivial passport data of foreigners entering and exiting Shanghai. Amongst this group of people sits a former senior intelligence official, partners at consulting firms, technologists, and academics. There are also everyday people such as flight attendants and even children. It is unclear the degree to which this section of the data is specifically targeted and appears to include non-trivial incidental collection as there is a disproportionate number of senior people within the parts of the system we evaluated. Taken together, this system gives us insight into the ambitions of China to collect what it can, to impose its will within its jurisdiction and to violate norms of privacy and accountability.",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/31/unionists-should-make-barnett-formula-work-highlight-westminster/,politics,"Not unreasonably, Nicola Sturgeon is accused of bribing Scottish voters with such offers as a four percent pay rise for nurses, the prospect of free school meals for primary school children and free bus travels for the under-22s. But isn’t the truth that the real bribery towards Scottish voters is coming from Westminster, through the Barnett formula?  It is just that Sturgeon is allowed to take the credit.   
 
A study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) this morning reveals that  d, the highest differential in 15 years. But it is hard to attribute this simply to fiscal recklessness on the part of the Scottish government.  The prime reason that Sturgeon has so much extra money to spend is the huge wad of cash she is handed through Scotland’s block grant from Westminster. It would wrong to describe this simply as a handout – it is Scotland’s share of taxes which are levied nationally.     
 
But the Scottish government is given a super-sized share thanks to the Barnett Formula, which apportions revenue for public spending across the United Kingdom’s four constituent countries. While Scotland has slightly higher upper rate of income rate and has its own borrowing facilities, according to the IFS the disproportionately-large block grant awarded to Scotland accounts for 28.9 pence out of the extra 30.6 pence per head spent on public services in Scotland.        
 
In other words, it is really the Westminster government, not Sturgeon, which is trying to buy Scottish votes. Moreover, it has been trying to do so for more than 40 years.  The Barnett Formula was devised by Labour Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Joel Barnett, in 1978, as a sweetener for Scottish voters ahead of the devolution referendum the following year. As a bribe it wasn’t a great success – Scots actually voted for devolution by a majority, but not by a large enough majority, under the terms of the vote, to enact the result.       
 
The formula then became politically impossible to reverse as government after government feared that reducing public spending in Scotland would feed nationalism. Indeed, the gap between Scottish and English public spending has grown wider as the formula failed to take into account differential population growth – the number of people resident in England has grown by 21 per cent since 1979, that in Scotland by 5 per cent.   But a fat lot of good the UK government’s bribery of Scottish voters does it.      
 
The SNP continues to bleat about Westminster-imposed ‘austerity’ – trying to make out that a tight-fisted Chancellor in Downing Street is withholding money from public services in Scotland. Sturgeon’s government plasters billboards of infrastructure projects with saltires and, until recently, EU flags, seeding the idea that they are providers of all – while ignoring the real source of the bounty.       
 
The UK government has tried to put this right in recent months, insisting that the Union flag is displayed alongside the saltire on Westminster-funded projects – something Sturgeon, with remarkable gall, describes as ‘posturing’.         
 
But if it  , the UK government is going to have to do better than that. The Prime Minister is not going to abolish the Barnett formula – even though its creator later described it as a ‘terrible mistake’ – so why not sing its praises instead? The extra cash could at least be rebranded as a ‘regional development bonus’ – and formally made part of the government’s ‘levelling up’ agenda.            
 
If you are going to bribe voters – and let’s face it, every government plays that game -- you might as well do it properly. Rather than try to hide the Barnett formula as some long-forgotten and slightly embarrassing hangover from the 1970s Labour government, why doesn’t the Prime Minister get out there and boast of ‘boosterism for the glens’ – and leave would-be SNP voters in no doubt where their free school meals and nurses’ pay rises are coming from? To cough up all this extra cash on the quiet -- and then allow the SNP to claim the electoral dividend – is ridiculous.    ",4
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/eu-wants-us-regret-brexit-got-funny-way-showing/,politics,"A summer holiday abroad looks more and more unlikely. But perhaps that’s for the best. Look at the   they’ve got in Spain, for example. Everyone will be made to wear face masks –  . Imagine the tan line. All round your mouth you’d have a big patch of skin that’s a completely different colour from the rest of your face. You’d go home looking like Homer Simpson. The men, at least, could cover it up by growing a beard. For the women, that might be a bit of a challenge. Chances are, then, that most of us will be  . Nothing wrong with that, of course. But the idea seems to have brought great amusement to some in the EU – if this extraordinary quote is anything to go by. Speaking to a British journalist from CNN this week, a senior EU diplomat – who, perhaps wisely, insisted on remaining nameless – sent the following message to the UK. “You might feel very happy on your little island when you are all vaccinated,” he or she smirked. “But your island might feel very small when you cannot leave it because your neighbours are not vaccinated!” Your little island, indeed. What nerve. What contempt. What sneering disdain. As insults go, however, it doesn’t strike me as tremendously effective. Mainly because it’s complete nonsense. I mean, come off it. Our “little island” will “feel very small”? My dear Monsieur or Madame diplomat, we’ve spent the past 12 months under house arrest. After that, our little island is going to feel absolutely enormous. A trip to the seaside will make us feel like Francis Drake. At the end of the day we’ll rush home, breathless to report the wonders we’ve seen. “Your Majesty, I bring news of a far-flung land, filled with untold mystery and delight. Early on Saturday morn my fellow explorers and I ventured forth in our blue Vauxhall Astra, and after a long and arduous voyage of over 45 minutes we reached a distant shore. There we were met by an astonishing sight. As far as the eye could see, the sands were thronged by grinning natives, half-naked and feasting upon a peculiar conical dish topped with some exotic icy sweetmeat.” “And what, pray tell, is the name of this alien realm?” “I fear, Your Majesty, that it was not easy to comprehend the natives’ tongue. But I gather that they call it… Margate.” Think about it. To have a good time this summer, we won’t need to leave our country. We’ll be thrilled just to leave our postcode. I’ve spent the past six months cooped up in Gravesend. Forget Spain, Italy and Greece, I’d bite your hand off for a fortnight in Dartford. So no, our little island is quite big enough to be getting on with, thank you. And anyway, who precisely is the butt of the joke here? Is it us? Or the EU? Let’s look at that supposed putdown again: “Your island might feel very small when you cannot leave it because your neighbours are not vaccinated!” But hang on a minute. It won’t be our fault if the EU isn’t vaccinated.  . Effectively, then, this diplomat is saying: “Ha! How foolish you British will feel when you compare the success of your vaccine programme with the shambles of ours! Yes, the joke will certainly be on you in that scenario!” Hard as I try, I fear I am unable to follow this logic. All I’ll say is: if the EU wants the British to regret Brexit, it’s got a funny way of showing it. Still, I doubt many Leavers will be bothered. If anyone in this country is going to be upset by that diplomat’s curious attempt at an insult, it’ll be those who were hoping we’d rejoin the EU. The plan was simple. Wait till the British public see for themselves how awful Brexit is in practice, then tell them they’d be better off back in the EU. Yet before their campaign has even begun, it’s been scuppered by none other than the EU itself. For prospective Rejoiners, it must be terribly frustrating. Imagine how it must feel. “Honestly, Brussels! How are we supposed to persuade voters that you’re nothing like the clueless bureaucrats that the Brexiteers said you were, if you keep on acting like the clueless bureaucrats that the Brexiteers said you were? It’s not easy trying to tell people you aren’t inept, spiteful and petty, when you insist on being so inept, spiteful and petty. Why don’t you start being compassionate and competent, like we Remainers told them you were? I just can’t understand it…” Still, there it is. No Europe for us this summer, it seems. We shall have to take our custom elsewhere. Or rather, take it here. Personally, I think holidays at home will do just fine. And if our Government follows the example of the Spanish and orders us to wear face masks while sunbathing, so be it. On a British beach, after all, there’s little chance of getting an embarrassing tan line. If only because there’s so little chance of getting a tan.",1
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/31/battle-against-lefts-ideology-racial-victimhood-has-just-begun/,politics,"We have entered the opening phase of a vicious new culture war. A Government-commissioned review, launched in the wake of last summer’s Black Lives Matters protests, has come to the heretical conclusion that race is less important than family and class in explaining the outcomes of different groups. The  is a forensic and unapologetic challenge to the liberal-Left conviction that the UK is structurally bigoted. It finds no evidence that institutional racism exists in Britain. In fact, it points out that, in some areas, such as education, particular ethnic minorities outperform their white counterparts. Even more boldly it ventures that UK should be seen as a model for other white-majority nations. Hours before the report was even published, it had already been trashed by the Left-wing activists who dominate discourse on race in Britain. Maurice Mcleod, the chief executive of Race on the Agenda, blasted the report as “government level gaslighting”. Halima Begum, head of the Runnymede Trust, called it a “gross offence” to grieving families of ethnic minorities who have died of Covid. Black Lives Matter, which has bloomed from a grassroots rabble into a slick establishment operation, snipped that it was “perplexed” by the report’s methodology and “disappointed” by oversight of police racism. A hostile reception is, on one level, a good sign. The report is a brave first step in confronting the  that has poisoned conversations about race. Its emphasis on concrete evidence rather than patronising theories – from critical race to unconcious bias – is radical. It is a deep rejection of “political blackness” – a post-communist doctrine seeded in the civil rights solidarity of 1960s, which lumps minorities together in a battle against capitalist white privilege. The inquiry’s jettisoning of the term BAME is not merely “semantics”, but the start of a fierce academic battle. The cliched acronym epitomises the 30-year colonisation of the cultural mainstream by the hard-Left, travelling from radicalised anthropology departments to executive boardrooms, public bodies, and media outfits. Tony Sewell – the Brixton-born educationalist who led the Commission – is trying to shift the debate away from victimising meta-theories towards a more nuanced discussion about race. His investigation is barbed with inconvenient facts. The ethnic pay gap has shrunk to 2.3 per cent overall and barely registers for employees under 30. Diversity is improving in professions like medicine and law. Sewell’s report dares to broach the complexity of black Britain. It finds, for example, that the exclusion rate for black Caribbean pupils is double that of their black African counterparts. Black Caribbean pupils are the only ethnic minority group that do not do as well or better than their white counterparts. Sewell has expressed his hope that this will go down as a landmark report which changes the dialogue over coming decades. That depends on how much fight – and skill – the centre-Right possesses. It will have to overthrow a hard-Left nexus of academics, NGOs and political agitators. They have been calling the shots ever since a notorious coup against the Institute for Race Relations in 1972. A three-year guerilla assault on the body, led by the novelist Ambalavaner Sivanandan, resulted in resignations, and a watershed shift in research focus from black people to white institutions. Sivanandan’s theory of “institutional racism” – that it is first finds venomous roots in the laws of the land (for example in biased immigration legislation), and then branches out to the executive and judiciary – went mainstream in the wake of the tragic murder of Stephen Lawrence. Since then its even more ambitious cousin, structural racism, has found evidence of oppression in everything from the benefits system to . Unconscious bias training has become a multi-million pound industry. Youth groups pitch themselves as intermediaries between black teens and “white-dominated” police and social services. Lecturers ride a gravy train of anti-racism advocacy and book deals on decolonising human rights. The only way to challenge such a vast, profitable and entrenched enterprise is to build a rival one in parallel. Funding must be secured for academic research into the challenges faced by the specific groups outlined in the Sewell report – particularly Caribbean Brits, the white working class and British Pakistanis. New NGOs and organisations with the same granular focus will also be needed. Yet this is the easy part. More difficult will be to contest a victimhood mentality that is becoming as entrenched as religious dogma. For all its troubles, America offers some inspiration here. Latinos and Afro-Americans identify as American in a way their British counterparts don’t because the country’s founding ideas – like freedom and the American Dream – are so bewitching. We desperately lack our own story of Britishness fired by energetic values. Winning hearts and minds will also demand sensitivity and courage. The Tories need to tread carefully as they make inroads into the political vipers nest of “parental responsibility”. They will also have to alter their language. We need to shift the debate, not from “inequality” to “culture” – but to “counter-culture”. The problem is not the customs of some immigrant groups per se but the toxic attitudes that have spread among second and third generation Britons. Most controversially, it is important not to fall into the trap of downplaying  . Woke teachings have enjoyed such momentum in recent years because multiculturalism has failed. The orthodoxy that tensions resolve themselves if you give immigrants cultural “space” has proved naive. Conservatives must confront the basic truth that progress can be both enriching and a destructive. They might well find more support for this revelation than the home truths of the Sewell report. It is no coincidence that the ethnic groups who feel the paradoxes of immigration most profoundly have rejected metropolitanland’s sunny mythology of “samba, saris and samosas” just as virulently as the white working class.",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/31/pro-independence-cranks-bloggers-snp-outcasts-flock-salmonds/,politics,"“Alba are hoisting a flag in the wind - planting our saltire on a hill,” a customarily hubristic Alex Salmond declared last Friday, as he blew up the Holyrood election campaign just 36 hours after it began with the launch of his   “We shall see how many will rally to our standard.” Those answering the battle cry, his opponents claim, were not of the ""strong calibre"" Mr Salmond predicted, but the misfits and conspiracists of the independence movement who had already found themselves sidelined by Nicola Sturgeon's moderate SNP. The former First Minister unveiled a slate of 32 candidates on Wednesday night, just six any with parliamentary experience, while he has largely relied upon a motley crew of hardcore nationalists, failed politicians and bloggers to spread his message online. Kenny MacAskill, a former Scottish justice secretary and the MP for East Lothian, was the   from the party Mr Salmond led for two decades, and in the end the most high-profile.  Best known for   Abdelbaset Al Megrahi on compassionate grounds in 2009, his departure was described as a “relief” by the SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who said Mr MacAskill had become an “increasing embarrassment”.  Neale Hanvey, who was suspended from the SNP   unearthed ahead of the 2019 general election but elected by voters in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath anyway, was the only other Westminister figure to jump ship.  Expected defections from other Salmond loyalists, such as the long-serving Western Isles MP Angus MacNeil, failed to materialise. Joanna Cherry, another Salmond ally, Sturgeon critic and respected QC who would have added intellectual heft to Alba, was also quick to rule herself out. When the final candidates list was published on Wednesday, Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, a former SNP MP who worked with Mr Salmond on his show on Russian propaganda station RT, was the most eye-catching previously unconfirmed name. As her opponents pointed out, it was at least her fourth party, having also previously been a Tory candidate and Labour member. It left Mr Salmond to turn to a handful of former SNP councillors, including a prominent Brexiteer.  One, Eva Comrie,  lead candidate in Mid Scotland and Fife, promptly bragged that Mr Salmond's plan to secure an independence 'supermajority' by persuading SNP supporters to back Alba with their second vote amounted to an attempt to ""manipulate"" the electoral system, confirming an attack line deployed by Alba's opponents. Attempts to recruit from outside the world of politics also backfired, resulting in a string of negative headlines. Both Alex Arthur, a boxer, and Jim Walker, an economist, were forced to issue apologies within hours of their candidacies being announced over  Mr Arthur, the former WBO world super-featherweight and Commonwealth champion, had recently said he would not take a coronavirus vaccine. Even worse, he claimed in January last year that “Romanian beggars” in Edinburgh were as “fat as big juicy over fed pigs”. Dr Walker, meanwhile, declared himself “mortified” after it emerged that he had publicly called Ms Sturgeon a “cow” only on Saturday.  It hardly reflected the “positive” campaign the Mr Salmond had promised, while a lack of vetting of Twitter accounts raised further questions about the professionalism of Alba’s operation, following a chaotic launch event. Others declaring their support for Alba have included Tommy Sheridan, the disgraced former MSP, who was sentenced to   for lying in his successful defamation case against the now defunct News of the World.  Craig Murray, a former British ambassador and another AFI candidate   after he breached a court order designed to give complainers in Mr Salmond’s trial anonymity, has become another of Alba's online outriders. A senior Scottish Labour source said: “Salmond is scrambling around in the dirt looking for the strays in the anti-UK movement. “When the leader himself isn’t fit for public office, it’s no surprise that prominent members include an MP suspended for anti-Semitic remarks and a convicted purjurer. The SNP need to make clear whether they’ll work with this discredited new party.” Correspondence sent to those signing up to join Mr Salmond’s new party makes leaves little doubt over its target audience - hardcore Scottish nationalists. New recruits are told their names had been “etched into history”, with the welcome note adding: “701 years ago the nobles of Scotland put their names to the Arbroath Declaration for Scotland’s independence. Today, you have put your name to the Alba declaration.” The most vocal Alba supporters have come not from within the party Mr Salmond led into government and to the brink of achieving its defining mission, but from the Scottish political blogosphere. Stuart Campbell, a former computer games journalist turned pro-independence polemicist, was once lauded by senior SNP politicians when he used his well-read but controversial Wings Over Scotland blog to launch vicious attacks on mainstream journalists and pro-UK politicians.  However, he has more recently been disowned by the party hierarchy, after he began aiming his vitriol at Ms Sturgeon over her two failed attempts to secure an independence referendum and her support for reforms that would make it  Unusually, bloggers were invited to take part in Alba’s first press conference, with Bath-based Mr Campbell invited to ask the third question. He praised Mr Salmond for being “magnanimous” in urging people to vote for the SNP in constituencies. Gareth Wardell, who runs the Grouse Beater blog and was expelled from the SNP in 2018 for writing an allegedly anti-Semitic blog about a Jewish trade union official and Labour activist, congratulated Mr Salmond at the press conference for “emerging from your nightmare”. He went on to attack “right wing newspaper journalists” and said he was “very sorry indeed to hear some of the questions put to you”.  Many mainstream reporters, but none of the bloggers, had asked Mr Salmond about his past conduct towards women. Mr Wardell also bemoaned being “alienated” and by SNP politicians who he said “block the very people who vote for them”. And while Mr Salmond has largely shunned the mainstream media since the day of the launch, giving just one radio interview, he held a virtual “bloggers huddle” on Monday to brief them on his plans. “It’s hardly surprising that Alex Salmond’s new divisive venture has attracted a complete lack of decent people to stand for them,” Annie Wells, who is standing for reelection in Glasgow for the Tories, said.  “The vetting process appears to be completely non-existent. “In a desperate bid to get back into the public limelight, Mr Salmond has attached himself to nationalist bloggers on the fringe of society in order to try and get his message out.” The question is now whether there are enough nationalists in Scotland, who still have a favourable view of Mr Salmond, to give the party representation at Holyrood. While the electoral system makes exact calculations uncertain, generally parties have to win around six per cent in any of eight electoral regions to win a list seat. John Curtice, Scotland’s leading pollster, has dismissed out of hand Mr Salmond’s claim that Alba could become the second largest at Holyrood. However, he has said there is a certain demographic he still appeals to. “Certainly Mr Salmond seems to be a little bit more popular amongst the more Leave [pro-Brexit] inclined end of the nationalist community,” Professor Curtice told the What Scotland Thinks podcast.  “That perhaps would fit with the other issue that has undoubtedly exercised some of those who are linked with Mr Salmond, which is is the debate about transgender rights. “If it looks as though they’re only getting two, three, four per cent [in polls] the wind may be blown out of the sails of this enterprise as quickly as it was blown into it with his revelation he was standing last Friday. “I don't think we should entirely discount his ability to pick up a few seats. But he’s certainly I think going to have to establish the credibility of his party pretty early on in the campaign, if he's going to maintain the kind of momentum and receive the kind of media attention upon which I think he will be heavily dependent.” Alba hailed the diversity of its 32 candidates yesterday, pointing out that they included 18 women, three people from a BAME ethnicity and three disabled people.   Mr Salmond said: “This is a thrilling list with a depth of talent, diversity and experience which I am proud to lead into the election. “Five days ago I asked how many would rally to the Alba standard. The answer comes in this hugely impressive list. “Alba is set to make a big impact as we seek to build the supermajority for independence in the next Scottish Parliament.”",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/03/31/exclusive-fifth-covid-deaths-hospitals-infections-caught-ward/,politics,"More than a fifth of the Covid deaths at some hospitals occurred after patients caught infections on wards, The Telegraph can disclose. Freedom of Information requests to hospital trusts around the country found that 3,264 people who caught Covid in hospital have died since March last year, with nine organisations recording that more than 100 patients had lost their lives after contracting the virus in their care. Bereaved families said that the number of people who died as a result of   for other illnesses must be part of any future  . The disclosure is likely to raise questions about whether infection control measures are adequate. On Wednesday night, Barbara Keeley MP, member of the Health and Social Care Select Committee, said that it was “unacceptable” that so many people had died after  . “Every Covid-19 death is a tragedy, and it is unacceptable that more than 3,000 people have now died from Covid-19 infections they acquired in hospital,"" she said. The figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act include patient deaths among both “probable” cases – those who first tested positive for the virus between eight and 14 days after they were admitted to hospital – and “definite” cases – those with a positive test 15 days or more after admission. At Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, 128 patients who were suspected to or definitely caught Covid while in hospital died – equivalent to 24 per cent of the total Covid deaths at the Trust. It was followed by Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust and Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Trust, where coronavirus infections caught in hospital accounted for 21 and 20 per cent of the organisations’ respective Covid deaths. University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust reported the highest number of deaths. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 222 patients – both probable and definite cases – have died with Covid after catching the virus in hospital.  A spokesperson for the Trust said that community transmission levels in their area had been “consistently higher” than the national average throughout the pandemic and infections were known to increase in line with this. They said that patient and staff safety was a “top priority” during the pandemic.  Less than half of NHS trusts responded so the true number of patients who died after catching Covid at the country’s hospitals could be much higher.  Official figures show that more than 40,000 patients caught Covid, or were suspected to, while in hospital being treated for other conditions. At the height of the second wave in January more than 3,000 patients a week were catching the virus in hospital. The latest figures show this has dropped to just over 200 patients a week. An NHS England spokesperson said that “hospitals implement robust infection control measures in line with the guidance from Public Health England and other UK-wide guidance”. When Matt Pears was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, his family felt hopeful that he would recover. Only in his late 40s, Mr Pears had been in good health before discovering he had cancer and the prognosis seemed to be good. But after he was admitted as an inpatient for intensive chemotherapy in the spring, his family became concerned. A potentially deadly virus was sweeping the country and they feared he might be vulnerable. In April, the family were told that Mr Pears had caught Covid-19 and by the middle of May, he had died.     “Obviously he was terrified, he was very frightened and he was very angry”, said Mrs Edmunds, Mr Pears's sister.  “We thought he was in the best place, we thought he was safe, and he just wasn’t.” Looking back, his sister said that whilst the family are full of praise for the medical staff who treated Mr Pears, they also feel “angry” that he caught the virus in hospital. Mr Pears was treated at the Royal Derby Hospital and whilst he was there, both he and his family had concerns, believing that infection control measures were “inadequate”.  “The  ”, said Mrs Edmunds. “I remember my brother saying to me on the phone: 'people are coming out onto his ward, without PPE'. They were coming from other wards as well and coming to see him.” Mrs Edmunds said that she felt the Government had “let down” people who went into hospital for other illnesses and then caught Covid-19. It is a distressing story, but not unfamiliar.  An investigation by The Telegraph has found that more than 3,000 people have died after catching coronavirus in hospital when they were being treated for other conditions.  Official figures show there have been more than 40,600 patients who caught Covid while in hospital being treated for an unrelated illness, but this data has only been published since August and does not include the number of patients who subsequently died. An NHS respiratory consultant who wished to remain anonymous said he had seen vulnerable respiratory patients mistakenly being put on Covid wards because their symptoms were similar to Covid, and later dying after catching the virus. “When these patients died it was especially distressing as we knew their infection was acquired in hospital,” he said. “I kept a record at first, and I got to around 15 patients who this happened to at the Trust where I was working during the first wave of the pandemic.” A number of trusts said in their FOI responses that they could not be certain Covid was the cause of death. Elaine Williams-Bird lost her brother, Ian Williams, last October after he caught Covid on the respiratory ward of Doncaster Royal Infirmary while being treated for pneumonia. The 56-year-old, who had a long-term respiratory condition, was admitted on Sept 23 and put on a respiratory ward which his family feared was “fast becoming a Covid ward”. They were told he had Covid two days before he died. During the first wave of the pandemic and during the national lockdown, Mr Williams’s daughter, who lived with and cared for him, was scrupulous about following the regulations and took every precaution to protect her father from Covid.  Ms Williams-Bird said that she “finds it hard to bear that Ian contracted Covid when he was in hospital”. “We will never know how much more time he might have had.”  In a letter to Ms Williams-Bird the hospital said that the number of Covid patients being admitted meant there was a “tipping point” when the respiratory ward Mr Williams was placed in became a designated Covid ward. The remaining patients who didn’t have the virus were moved elsewhere. All the hospitals said they had followed  .  Dr Magnus Harrison, executive medical director at University Hospitals of Derby and Burton, said that their “staff strictly follow Public Health England guidance on PPE and infection prevention and control measures”. Dr Ken Agwuh, director of Infection, Prevention and Control and Consultant Microbiologist at Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals, said: “While Covid and non-Covid patients may be cared for within the same area they are never nursed in the same enclosed bays and – throughout the pandemic – we have followed national guidance to ensure we deliver care as safely as possible.”  ",0

The First Minister insisted her ""number one priority"" would be steering the country through the pandemic and argued that required ""experienced leadership and serious government."" But she then pivoted onto calling for  and claimed this was needed to ensure she had ""the powers we need for a long term recovery made in Scotland."" Speaking in Glasgow, she unveiled an SNP campaign poster featuring an image of her with folded arms next to the slogan: ""Scotland’s future is Scotland’s choice. And nobody else’s."" This is an oblique reference to another separation referendum amid concerns something more direct would alienate voters. However, Ms Sturgeon was forced to admit during a TV debate on Tuesday that she wants another vote by the end of 2023. But Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said the country and the NHS faces ""biggest challenge of our lifetime"" in recovering from Covid and argued it would take much longer than 2023 for this to happen. Arguing that Scotland's cancer treatment backlog from the pandemic is now a ""national emergency"", he highlighted the case of Glasgow grandmother Mary Hudson, 69, who was forced to travel to London for NHS surgery after her ovarian cancer returned. Her family claims they were informed that the Glasgow Royal Infirmary was only currently providing operations for first occurrences of cancer. An estimated 7,000 people in Scotland are believed to be living with undiagnosed cancer as a result of the pandemic’s impact on cancer services. Ms Sturgeon this week promised the SNP would set up three fast-track cancer diagnosis centres by summer if she wins the election. However, her government pledged four months ago to provide two of these units by spring and neither has been set up. Launching the SNP election campaign, she said: ""In this election the SNP’s offer is this. First and foremost - strong leadership and serious government to lead Scotland through the pandemic. Covid is not yet over. We need an experienced hand at the wheel. ""Second, a transformational policy programme to kick-start the recovery with the NHS, jobs and an economy that works for everyone at its core."" But she claimed that ""Westminster is taking Scotland in the wrong direction"" despite the UK Treasury supporting around 900,000 jobs through the furlough scheme and providing her government with millions of vaccine doses. Ms Sturgeon said: ""When the crisis is over - after Covid - we will give you the right to decide whether to become an independent country and take our future into our own hands."" But Mr Sarwar claimed Ms Sturgeon and Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, were out of tune with the public mood when they traded barbs during the TV debate over an independence referendum as ""Covid has changed our politics."" Asked about Ms Sturgeon's 2023 referendum deadline, he warned that “the crisis isn’t over the day the lockdown ends"", stressing that it “has a much more longer-term impact”. He added: “I don’t think we can underestimate the scale of the challenge that faces us. You speak to any business-owner across the country and they will tell you that the economy will not re-start the day lockdown ends or Covid goes away. “It’s going to take time to get back to those pre-Covid levels if they can ever get back to those pre-Covid levels.” He added: ""The backlog for cancer treatment in Scotland is now a national emergency. There are thousands of missing patients and there needs to be an urgent plan to address this crisis.""",0

It distinguishes its safari parks from conventional zoos, saying on its website: “Our parks lead the way in animal care, enclosure design, enrichment and breeding success and are designed to be breeding sanctuaries for some of the world’s most rare and endangered animals.” The charity funds and manages animal protection programmes in Congo, Gabon, Java and Madagascar, as well as backing schemes in India and Cambodia.  It was reportedly the first organisation in the world to send captive-bred cheetahs from the UK into a wild habitat in South Africa in 2014. ",0
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2021/03/31/exclusive-covid-vaccine-passports-would-un-british-sayssir-keir/,politics," being used for everyday social activities once the pandemic has eased would be against the ""British instinct"", Sir Keir Starmer has told The Telegraph. In his most critical comments on the idea to date, the Labour leader said in an interview that the Government must not   to decide whether to make such checks. Sir Keir stressed that   was a complex issue, adding that he would scrutinise government proposals before deciding whether to oppose them. But he said: ""My instinct is that,  , as the number of hospital admissions and deaths go down, there will be a British sense that we don't actually want to go down this road."" The remarks increase the possibility that the Government could struggle to find the votes to get any Covid passport proposals through the House of Commons, given that the Liberal Democrats and scores of Tory rebels oppose the plans. Last week, Boris Johnson  , which government sources clarified could mean checks for a Covid jab, a negative test or antibodies for the virus. No final decisions have been made, but the Government is considering allowing such checks   at everything from football matches and concerts to business conferences. The first indication of firm proposals is expected next Monday when Mr Johnson provides an update on a review into Covid certificates  , the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Both Mr Johnson and Mr Gove had previously expressed opposition to such ideas, but have recently signalled that they could be in favour of such a scheme. New UK statistics have shown  , down from 552 to 332 in the last seven days. The weekly number of Covid hospitalisations dropped around a quarter, to 2,321. During his interview, Sir Keir also attempted to reposition Labour on crime and policing, stressing that it has not been ""strong"" enough on the issue in recent years. He called for tougher sentences for people who assault key pandemic workers such as shop staff and a lower bar for when police officers should investigate persistent antisocial behaviour. He also said there was ""no case"" for Britain rejoining the European Union and revealed that he had not talked to his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, for five months. But some of his most eye-catching comments came on Covid passports – an issue that has made headlines in the last week after the Prime Minister's  . ""I think this is really difficult and I'm not going to pretend there's a clear black and white, yes-no easy answer on this. It is extremely difficult,"" he said.  Sir Keir added that Covid passports for international travel were inevitable and the focus of the Government should be on maximising the vaccine rollout, but said: ""My instinct is that… [if] we get the virus properly under control, the death rates are near zero, hospital admissions very, very low, that the British instinct in those circumstances will be against  ."" He stressed that he wanted to find a cross-party consensus on the issue and would only decide Labour's stance once he had studied detailed proposals from the Government. But he made it clear that he was against Mr Johnson's idea of letting pubs decide themselves, saying: ""I think this idea that we sort of outsource this to individual landlords is just wrong in principle."" His comments are likely be cheered by lockdown-sceptic Conservative MPs who have vowed to force the Government to abandon plans for Covid passports for pubs. Mr Gove held private talks with opponents of the idea across the political spectrum earlier this week in an attempt to head off early vocal criticism. Government sources have repeatedly stressed that his review is taking in looking at the moral and ethical implications of using Covid passports within Britain. It is understood one idea being looked at is for the NHS app, which is available on smartphones, to be used to allow people to show their verified Covid status. It remains to be seen under what circumstances the Government would allow Covid status checks to be carried out and what legislative route it would take to bring that about. A room high in the stands above the pitch at Leeds United's Elland Road ground is not the most obvious location from which to launch an attack on the Government's record on crime. But it was to that location that The Telegraph was invited to hear Sir Keir reveal a new front in his drive to reshape the Labour Party and make it electable again. A year almost to the day since he  , Sir Keir was visiting the club to hear about the local crime prevention programmes it funds. Criminal justice is a topic close to his heart, having risen through the ranks as a barrister to become Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) before crossing into Parliament in 2015. But there is politics here too, with Sir Keir sensing Labour has, for too long, been out of step with where the country is on issues of crime and policing. Over 40 minutes, the leader outlined his stance as well as firing a warning shot on Covid powers, responding to   and drawing a line under Brexit. ""I think that we have not been clear enough and strong enough on things like  ,"" Sir Keir said in a critique of the party's stance under his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn. He added that the ""gap"" on the issue between Labour and the communities it is meant to represent had become too big and must be narrowed, noting his prosecutorial past to back up the point.  ""I know what it means for a community here or across the country not to feel safe,"" he said. ""And by that I mean simple testimony – if you don't feel you can go out after dark down your own street or road, there is something fundamentally wrong. And too many people are in that position."" Sir Keir wants a new law to give victims of persistent antisocial behaviour the right to demand that a police officer investigate, arguing that the current bar for action is too low. He also wants key workers such as shop assistants and transport staff to be included in a legal change that would give attackers up to two years in prison, given  . And he has called for a £150 million fund for police forces to hire more community support officers and backroom staff to ease the paperwork load for frontline officers, freeing them up to get back on the streets. The focus on antisocial behaviour has the ring of another Labour leader who once vowed to be ""tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime"". Is this not a straight copy from the Tony Blair playbook? ""Tony Blair was rebuilding the Labour Party into the '97 election almost a quarter of a century ago,"" Sir Keir said, not quite denying the similarities outright but stressing his focus on looking forward. The Labour leader was more eager to draw comparisons with his opposite number, Boris Johnson, as he rebuffed the idea that the Conservatives were the party of law and order in eye-catching terms. ""Whilst Boris Johnson was writing columns for newspapers, I was actually prosecuting terrorists, sex offenders and serious criminals, and therefore dealing with these issues is in my DNA,"" Sir Keir said. Specifically, he pointed to how, as DPP, he oversaw prosecutions in  , when terrorists plotted to blow up seven planes over the Atlantic. His team pointed out Home Office statistics showing a sharp   recorded in the last six years but a drop in the number of charges or summons. ""That cannot be badged as a party strong on crime and on criminal justice and a party strong on law and order,"" he said. A Home Office source claimed the increase was due to ""improvements in the reporting of crime"", noting a recent crime survey showing that violent incidents fell over the same period. Tories have accused the Labour leader of being weak on crime for not voting  , which increased sentences for a range of serious crimes. One area not in dispute is Sir Keir's role in voting through the Government's   changes, which have seen vast swathes of everyday activities outlawed in the Covid crisis. He has often pushed for quicker lockdowns, but on other times a liberal, human rights lawyer could be expected to champion civil liberties. Is he uncomfortable at all with the new laws that have emerged? ""If that was a long term proposition I'd be very, very worried about it and I would be fighting it tooth and nail,"" he said of the Covid laws in a hint of a more critical stance to come. ""Nobody wants these restrictions, nobody enjoys living under these restrictions, and they shouldn't be in place for a moment longer than is absolutely necessary."" He made a similar point on Covid vaccine passports, warning that their use on the domestic front, such as in pubs, once the pandemic eased would be against the ""British instinct"". In his short parliamentary career – it is easy to forget that he only became the MP for Holborn and St Pancras six years ago – Sir Keir is perhaps best known for his battles against Brexit. As Mr Corbyn's shadow Brexit secretary, he led the push inside the shadow cabinet for a more open position to a second referendum and was once  . Has he really given up hopes of Britain's EU membership? And if so, is he best placed to win back   that switched en masse to the Tories last election? ""We've left. We are no longer a member of the EU. We've got a deal, we've got to make that deal work,"" he said. ""There's no case for rejoining the EU and I've been very clear about that. The Remain-Leave debate is over.” So does he accept it was better that Britain was not in the European Medicines Agency – which he supported staying in back in January 2017 – given the UK's solo Covid vaccine rollout success? ""Well look, in 2017 it was an entirely different context, obviously,"" he said, tip-toeing around answering the question head on. The narrative of Sir Keir's first year can be read two ways – either getting the party competitive again in trying circumstances or beginning to flatline after a ""no longer Corbyn in charge"" bounce. When he  , Labour was hovering around 20 percentage points behind the Conservatives in general election voting polls, according to YouGov statistics. The gap was closed by January, but the Tories are now getting close to 10 points ahead – bringing a wave of sniping at Sir Keir's leadership and the party's direction. ""I mean, it's tough,"" he said, declining to give his first year a rating out of 10. ""We'd had the worst election results since 1935 when I took over as leader of the Labour Party."" He noted that he had yet to give a single speech before an in-person audience as leader due to Covid restrictions, and believes the Tories have had a ""vaccine bounce"" in the polls. ""As we come out of year one into year two, I want to take the mask off and open the throttle,"" Sir Keir declared. But who will be joining him for the ride? Will   – the subject of much reshuffle sacking speculation – still be in post by the end of the year? ""Look, Annelise is doing a really good job. And she, like the rest of the shadow team, are out there and we all want to make the argument on behalf of the Labour Party,” he said. Which is not quite a straight 'yes'. What is clearer is who will not be on the Starmer bandwagon. Asked when was the last time he talked to Mr Corbyn, Sir Keir said it was the night before   came out. That report, which led to Mr Corbyn's  , was published last October. Put another way, the pair have not talked for five months.",5

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/03/29/facebook-plans-undersea-cables-google-boost-south-east-asia/,business,"Facebook is planning to build two new undersea internet cables between south-east Asia and North America to boost connections across the Pacific. The social media giant said it hopes to have both cables up and running by 2024, working with Google and local telecoms providers to create a new digital bridge between Singapore, Indonesia and the United States. Tech companies are increasingly helping fund the undersea cables that connect emerging markets to their US servers. Last year, a separate connection to Hong Kong was blocked last year by the Trump administration over security concerns. Kevin Salvadori, Facebook's vice president of network investments, told Reuters the new cables would be the first direct connections between North America and parts of Indonesia, which is the company's fifth biggest market and an increasingly important source of growth. One cable, called Echo, is a partnership between Facebook, Google and the Indonesian telecoms provider XL Axiata, while the other, Bifrost, involves Telkom, another Indonesian carrier, and Keppel, a Singaporean conglomerate. Mr Salvadori said: ""Those will be the first two cables to go through a new diverse route crossing the Java Sea, and they will increase overall subsea capacity in the trans-Pacific by about 70pc."" He added that the cables would require ""a very material investment"" from Facebook. They will still require regulatory approval. Indonesia is a big market for Facebook, with an estimated 130m users and widespread internet use but very few wired broadband connections,  . The Asia-Pacific region is one of Facebook's fastest-growing sources of revenue, accelerating by 31pc in the last three months of 2020 and an average of 27pc over the past two years. As well as the new cables, Facebook said last year that it would build 1,864 miles of fibre optic broadband linking 20 Indonesian cities, as well as a series of new public Wi-Fi hotspots.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/politics/biden-infrastructure.html,politics,"WASHINGTON — It has been 40 years since President Ronald Reagan declared in his first inaugural address that “government is not the solution to our problems, government is the problem.”,The , on Wednesday — $2 trillion in federal investment in poured concrete, electric car chargers, artificial intelligence and social engineering — is a bet that government can do colossal things that the private sector cannot.,In fact, when the long-awaited “infrastructure week” finally arrived in Washington, it turned out to be about a lot more than just new highways and the replacement of old lead pipes. Urged on by the left wing of his party, and reminded by historians that Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson went big, Mr. Biden is using the framework of rebuilding crumbling highways and bridges to try to reshape the American economy by focusing more on long-range problems like climate change and inequality that have been caught up in the culture wars.,It will take years to know whether Mr. Biden’s initiative will have the lasting power of the New Deal or the Great Society, or whether it can “change the paradigm,” as he argued a few weeks ago.,Yet it is already clear it is based on the gamble that the country is ready to dispense with one of the main tenets of the Reagan revolution, and show that for some tasks the government can jump-start the economy more efficiently than market forces. Mr. Biden has also made a bet that the trauma of the coronavirus pandemic and the social and racial inequities it underscored have changed the political center of gravity for the nation.,Mr. Biden’s infrastructure plan fits with his declaration last week that “we’ve got to prove democracy works,” which was an acknowledgment that the Chinese government’s decision to underwrite “national champions” like the telecom giant Huawei and pour billions of dollars into key technologies like artificial intelligence is attracting imitators. Mr. Biden, his aides say, feels a burning sense of competition to prove that democratic capitalism can work.,Last week, Mr. Biden cast the competition as “a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies,” a line he repeated in abbreviated form on Wednesday in a speech in Pittsburgh. But he went further, saying that “there’s a lot of autocrats in the world” — clearly referring to Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia — “who think the reason why they are going to win is democracies can’t reach consensus any longer.”,It is an argument that has echoes of the Cold War, this time with China playing the central adversarial role that the Soviet Union once did. And Mr. Biden, sensing this may be his best argument for a bipartisan consensus, pressed the case by citing President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s investment in the highway system and President John F. Kennedy’s in the space race.,“This is central to where the president’s head is at when it comes to the infrastructure plan,” said Brian C. Deese, the director of Mr. Biden’s National Economic Council and one of the chief architects of the proposal.,“The world has been watching as the world’s greatest superpower was ravaged by a virus and wasn’t capable of mounting a response for almost a year,” Mr. Deese said. “And now it’s waiting to see whether the United States can deliver on great things domestically,” as an indicator of whether it will restore its place as the leader of the international order.,It is not the first time Reagan’s reliance on markets to fix the nation has been challenged, but no previous effort in recent decades was on the scale Mr. Biden presented on Wednesday.,Reagan himself pushed through a tax increase. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton tried a few modest experiments in what used to be called “industrial policy,” with efforts to bolster the semiconductor industry. President George W. Bush oversaw a huge expansion of the security state after Sept. 11, 2001, attacks as well as a Medicare prescription-drug plan for seniors that many in his own party objected to as interference with the market.,President Barack Obama’s health law was, depending on one’s political view, a government intervention in the distribution of medical services or a way of fixing private markets to ensure that health insurance was more widely available.,But Mr. Biden’s plan is a mammoth public investment that amounts to about 1 percent of gross domestic product for each of the next eight years. Republicans, who traditionally have favored big infrastructure projects, are objecting just on its size, especially after a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan that, unlike the infrastructure bill, was intended as a one-time jolt to the economy.,They are also objecting to the way Mr. Biden is proposing to pay for it: an increase in corporate taxes over the next 15 years for a building plan that will last only eight. And, Mr. Biden said on Wednesday, there would be higher taxes on those making more than $400,000 a year.,Taken together, those come down to reversing the tax cuts of President Donald J. Trump, who on Wednesday denounced Mr. Biden’s plan “a classic globalist betrayal” that he argued would benefit politicians, government bureaucrats and China.,But Mr. Trump himself may have helped make it possible by throwing out so much Republican orthodoxy. He let deficits soar, and invoked tariffs on Chinese goods that American consumers paid. And his actions neither drove up interest rates nor tanked the stock market, raising confidence inside the Biden administration that it may have more leeway to pump money into the economy without fears of rapid overheating.,The plan includes big outlays for traditional infrastructure projects: $115 billion for highways, roads and 10,000 small bridges that need to be reconstructed. There is $85 billion for transit systems and $80 billion for Amtrak — an acknowledgment that the once-tempting idea that a passenger high-speed rail program could be a profitable private enterprise, able to raise the capital to keep up-to-date, was a fantasy.,Then there is the unfamiliar part, stretching the definition of infrastructure in new directions. There is $180 billion for research and development and $50 billion to revive semiconductor production in the United States, clearly intended to counter China. Billions of dollars for internet connections in ill-served rural and poor communities is being sold as a jobs program, an issue of equity and an enabler of innovation.,To many on the left, the Biden plan is too cautious, a fraction of what Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called for when they ran against Mr. Biden for the Democratic nomination. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York Democrat and perhaps the most influential voice of the progressive movement, declared after seeing Mr. Biden’s plan that “this is not nearly enough.”,But the argument the Biden administration will make in coming days is that it simply restores the status quo of five decades ago when public investment in research and development, infrastructure and commercialization of technology was, as a percentage of the economy, significantly higher than it is today.,“What this is designed to do,” Mr. Deese said, “is to get us back up to something approaching what that level was in the 1960s.”",6
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/theater/follies-broadway-50-year-anniversary.html,arts,"It was supposed to be a murder mystery: ,. What it became was a different kind of mystery entirely: a musical that got ,, alienated much of its audience and lost most of its investment — yet survived.,Not only is “Follies,” which opened on Broadway on April 4, 1971, still here 50 years later, trailing a string of revivals, revisals and gala concerts, but it is also now recognized as the high-water mark of the serious “concept” musical, that genre in which form and function are brought into the tightest possible alignment. The score, by Stephen Sondheim, is a marvel and a minefield of layered meanings. The sets make comments. And in the original staging, by Harold Prince and Michael Bennett, even frivolity had to serve a purpose.,Not that there was much frivolity in James Goldman’s script; the gun disappeared but the two couples were still floridly dysfunctional. Both wives had been showgirls in the Weismann (think Ziegfeld) Follies at the end of its run of annual extravaganzas in the years between the World Wars. Both had been in love with Ben, a Stage Door Johnny with big ambitions. But Phyllis was smart enough to nab him; they are now wealthy, unhappy sophisticates. Sally — romantic, conventional — got Ben’s feckless pal Buddy; never for one moment in the 30 ensuing years has she been happy with the trade-off.,During a Follies reunion at the ,, on the night before it will be razed to make room for a parking lot, the two couples meet up and promptly disintegrate. As they do, their past selves appear alongside them as living characters. At the same time, former stars of the Follies relive memories and stumble through old numbers, magically ventriloquized from Broadway’s past in the Sondheim songs.,As the ghosts crowd in, the couples’ tangled history is unearthed, bringing them to the point of a group nervous breakdown in the form of a 30-minute mini-“Follies” of their own. To see them collapse, dissolving into a fantasy world accompanied by a Golden Age score, is to see American optimism collapse along with them.,But its big canvas is not the only reason “Follies” remains important. (See seven more reasons, and a caveat, below.) In its seriousness and cleverness, in its matching of style to substance, in its use of a medium to comment on itself, it has hardly ever been bettered. In any case, ambitious musical theater would never be the same; we would not have “,” or “,” or “,” without “Follies” hovering behind them, the most beautiful ghost of all.,“Follies” is about two lousy marriages. Mucking around among their mind games and betrayals, it more readily recalls midcentury drama than anything in the musical canon. (Imagine “,” staged by Busby Berkeley.) But it’s also about the lousy marriage of American ideals and American reality, a union of near opposites polished and preserved by the shellac of nostalgia.,The brilliant concept was to use the two stories to inform each other, letting the Faulknerian past that is “not even past” intrude upon the present. So Sally’s ghost makes love to Ben while his makes love to her; later, she sings a torch song that sounds as if it’s from 1941. The reunion, if it reunifies one couple, destroys another. Even the songs we love are dangerous. That paradox is crystallized in “,,” warbled by an ancient Viennese soprano while her younger self casually tosses off its coloratura. “Never look back,” the lyric warns. “Follies” is what happens if you do.,The ghosts of Follies past that live in the theater had to be both ethereal and imposing. Casting was done among Las Vegas showgirls who were already six feet tall before their enormous headdresses turned them into giants. Even so, a Who Was Who of middle-aged and older women stole the show: Dorothy Collins, 44; Mary McCarty, 47; Yvonne De Carlo, 48; Alexis Smith, 49; Fifi D’Orsay, 66; and Ethel Shutta, 74, among them. Though cast for the kick of nostalgia their names elicited, they made survival itself seem vital and sexy, as , demonstrated.,All of the performative songs in “Follies” — the ones sung as if they were real numbers from the past — are pastiches, sampling Harold Arlen (“I’m Still Here”), George Gershwin (“Losing My Mind”), Irving Berlin (“Beautiful Girls”), Sigmund Romberg (“One More Kiss”) and many others. With this catch: In almost every case, they are better crafted and richer than their templates. Which makes their salute to the past a wonderfully complicated, and sometimes cruel, gesture.,Stella Deems, an old-school belter, had a specialty “mirror” number in the Follies. Now, at the reunion, she and six alumna of the chorus line, including Phyllis and Sally, try to perform it, even though the dance (as one of them puts it) “winded me when I was 19.” Soon you see why, as the choreography, which at first involves simple poses and mirroring gestures, turns into an exhausting tap extravaganza, courtesy of Bennett. But the mindblower comes halfway through, when strange shards of spinning light emerge from the dark behind the panting, middle-aged women. These are the ghosts of their former selves: glamazons in mirror-encrusted costumes performing the number tirelessly and perfectly.,By the time the real and the remembered choruses merge in a thrilling finale, the idea of mirroring has taken on a larger meaning. “Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord!” Stella sings in wonder and horror at the person she sees in her looking glass. “That woman is me!”,De Carlo — a movie star of the ’40s and ’50s but , to everyone thereafter — had the biggest name in the cast yet one of the smallest roles. She needed a showstopper; the one Sondheim originally wrote wasn’t working. During tryouts in Boston, he replaced it with “I’m Still Here,” , that catalogs with tart good spirits a showbiz life (based on Joan Crawford’s) in which you “career from career to career.” It could not have been staged more simply: De Carlo basically just stood downstage and let it rip. Still, it was (and remains, in the many interpretations since) a knockout, driving home the point that long-term professional survival, and maybe emotional survival as well, is often a matter of inoculating oneself with failure.,At $800,000, “Follies” was a very expensive show for its time, but you saw where the money went. ,’s set, which , for the final sequence, was technically complex; ,’s costumes were among the most sumptuous seen on a Broadway stage since Ziegfeld himself. And with all the major roles doubled by “ghosts,” the cast was huge: 47 performers, not including understudies and standbys.,“Nearly everything that could cause a Broadway musical to go over budget did,” says Ted Chapin, now the president of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization but then Prince’s apprentice — and the author of “,,” a memoir of that experience. “If it were produced today, I would imagine it would log in at close to $30 million.” Alas, that’s a sum no one would spend on such a chancy show, which means we’ll never see its like again.,In 1971, the graphic artist David Edward Byrd was best known for his rock posters, including one for the original Woodstock and ,. But he’d started designing for theatrical productions as well, and when an “aesthetic argument” led Prince to ditch one of his Art Deco-inspired sketches, Byrd came up with the ,: an impassive beauty with flowing Technicolor hair and a branching crack from chin to brow. (The face was based on Marlene Dietrich’s, in ,) To Byrd, it represented the end of an era, but it also conveyed, with powerful concision, the crackup of an American fantasy of endless tranquillity. And, not incidentally, made a Broadway show seem as cool as Woodstock.,“Follies” is brilliant and “Follies” is a mess. It bowls me over perhaps more than any other musical, yet I have never been fully satisfied with it intellectually. Look beneath the unparalleled packaging — the score, costumes, casting, staging — and you find a lot that doesn’t add up. As Frank Rich noted in ,, it’s “a musical about the death of the musical” — a wonderful paradox but one that undermines the experience. If musicals are dead … is this one too?,Sometimes — even when Carlotta sings “I’m Still Here” — the vaunted concept seems a bit opaque. (If it’s about her own life, how could it also be her Follies number?) And don’t look too closely at the main characters, either; spouters of self-conscious dialogue, they are only fully believable when they sing. For that, Goldman usually gets the blame — but if so, he should also get credit for providing the armature for everyone else’s epochal achievement. It may be about the death of musicals, but “Follies” pointed the way to bringing them back to life.",1
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/politics/jill-biden-california.html,politics,"DELANO, Calif. — Jill Biden, the first lady, traveled to California on Wednesday to visit a pop-up vaccination site for farmworkers who have lobbied for priority access to shots during the pandemic.,In remarks to about 100 farmworkers and local politicians who had gathered to mark the birthday of César Chávez, the labor organizer who formed the country’s first successful farmworkers’ union, Dr. Biden told them that their work — and their health — had been essential to a nation crippled by the coronavirus.,“We depended on those who kept going to work every single day,” she told the crowd. “Without the farmworkers who kept harvesting our food, or the factory workers who packaged it, or the grocery store clerks who stocked our shelves, hey, we wouldn’t have made it through this year.”,It was the latest trip the first lady has made in service of the Biden administration’s political priorities, this time to maintain the president’s close ties to union workers who helped him win the election. When she arrived at the Forty Acres property outside Delano, a historic site that became the headquarters of the United Farm Workers of America, Dr. Biden was greeted by several members of Mr. Chávez’s family.,She also heard from a group of female farmworkers who picked grapes, citrus fruits and blueberries in nearby fields. Several asked the Biden administration to provide pathways to citizenship, protection from discrimination and stronger union representation.,“He is a union person. I am a member of the teachers’ union,” Dr. Biden said. “We are a union couple.”,At one point, the first lady heard from a 27-year-old mother of three that some women were forced to bring their young children into the fields with them because they did not have access to child care. Dr. Biden told the woman that she hoped that direct payments of $1,400, part of the administration’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package, would reach those workers. The woman replied that many workers did not have access to those benefits because they were undocumented.,“I think the country needs to heal,” Dr. Biden told the group, adding that people had been hurting from the pandemic. “I’m hoping you and your family’s life get better.”,In a sign of the labor movement’s significance to the Biden administration, a member of the Chávez family had traveled with the first lady from Washington: ,, the White House’s director of intergovernmental affairs, is Mr. Chávez’s granddaughter.,During her remarks, Dr. Biden said that the president supported the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, a bill that would grant temporary legal status to seasonal farmworkers, many of whom are undocumented, and offer a 10-year path to citizenship.,“As president, Joe is fighting for people who often go unseen,” Dr. Biden said. “And that’s exactly the kind of immigration policy he’s working to build — one that treats children and families with dignity and creates fair pathways to citizenship, including for essential workers.”,Thousands of Central Valley farmworkers have been scheduled to receive the coronavirus vaccine at Forty Acres over six weekends in March and April. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat, and his partner, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, joined the first lady on Wednesday at the site.

It also spared Democratic leaders from having to weigh in on whether to throw out the results of a contested vote months after President Donald J. Trump’s false claims of a stolen election fueled a partisan clash and a deadly riot at the Capitol.,Republicans had signaled that they were ready to turn the dispute into a political cudgel against the majority party, and some vulnerable Democrats who had come under attack on the issue in their districts were deeply uncomfortable with the prospect of intervening.,In a statement on Wednesday, Ms. Hart repeated her claim that voters had been “silenced” but acknowledged that the contest had become politically contentious.,“Despite our best efforts to have every vote counted, the reality is that the toxic campaign of political disinformation to attack this constitutional review of the closest congressional contest in 100 years has effectively silenced the voices of Iowans,” she said. “It is a stain on our democracy that the truth has not prevailed, and my hope for the future is a return to decency and civility.”,Ms. Hart’s campaign had , that they believed were legally cast but “wrongfully” uncounted by state election officials during a districtwide recount in the fall. Rather than taking her case to court in Iowa before the election was certified, Ms. Hart opted to wait and appeal the results to the House Administration Committee, invoking a 1960s law.,With Democrats in control of the chamber, they would have run the review and had the power to order their own recount and a vote by the full House on whether to unseat Ms. Miller-Meeks in favor of their own candidate, which would have added to their eight-seat majority.,“I’m deeply appreciative that we’re ending this now,” Ms. Miller-Meeks said in a recorded statement on Wednesday evening. “It’s time to move forward, to unite as one group of people supporting Iowa’s Second Congressional District.”,Democratic leaders had argued that they were obliged to take the appeal seriously, but Republicans mobilized, accusing them of hypocrisy and trying to steal an election that had been verified by state officials. To drive home the point, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, flew to Iowa on Wednesday before Ms. Hart’s announcement to rail against what he called an attempted political power grab intended to pad Democrats’ margin of control.,“Iowans made a decision,” Mr. McCarthy said. “And it’s their voice, and they have a right to have Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who they elected, to continue to serve them.”,The dispute was a particularly tricky issue for politically vulnerable House Democrats, who have become targets of a coordinated pressure campaign on the matter.

(Guston died in 1980.),The timing “is urgent because of the art’s relevance to our cultural context today,” Marc Payot, the president of the gallery, said in an email on Wednesday, though he said the show was not organized in response to the postponement of the Guston retrospective at four major museums last year.,Mr. Payot mentioned the “racial reckoning and widespread calls for social justice” after the deaths of , and , last summer, and how they “echo the context in which Guston made these late works.”,Last year, three museums in the United States and one in Britain had delayed programming a Guston retrospective, the first in more than 15 years, that included images with the painter’s motif of cartoonish Klansmen because organizers determined the images needed to be better contextualized for the current political moment.,Though Guston intended the Klan imagery to criticize racism, anti-Semitism and bigotry, organizers said they worried it could upset viewers and that the works could be “,.”,The touring exhibition was supposed to open on June 7, 2020, at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, before moving to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, then to Tate Modern in London, and finally, to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The directors of the museums announced in a joint statement last fall that the retrospective would , — they had , the exhibition until 2024 — and that “additional perspectives and voices” would be needed before the work could be displayed.,Some in the art world called the decision a necessary step back amid the racial justice protests, while , for avoiding challenging works of art.,But the National Gallery had the support of its board of trustees, including Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation, a philanthropic giant. He , in September that if museums had not taken a step back to re-examine the exhibition, it would have appeared “tone deaf.”,“What those who criticize this decision do not understand,” Mr. Walker said, “is that in the past few months, the context in the U.S. has fundamentally, profoundly changed on issues of incendiary and toxic racist imagery in art, regardless of the virtue or intention of the artist who created it.”,Mr. Payot said on Wednesday that Hauser & Wirth had planned its exhibition “for quite some time.” The show will focus on Guston’s figurative paintings and will include works that have never been exhibited before. It will also be accompanied by public programs.,Mr. Payot acknowledged the works were challenging. “But as Guston’s daughter, Musa Mayer, has said, ‘These paintings meet the moment we are in today. The danger is not in looking at Philip Guston’s work, but in looking away.’”,The gallery was still making final selections for the show, but Mr. Payot said that it would include the 1969 painting “Blackboard,” which depicts three hooded Klansmen. He called the painting “an astonishing work, heartbreaking in what it says about the way we teach racism to perpetuate it in America.”,“It’s a rarely seen canvas by an artist at the height of his powers,” he said. “And we are honored to be able to show it.”",0
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/theater/streaming-theater.html,arts,"Theater audiences have become more like movie fans and television bingers: They can settle in for a double bill. Before the pandemic, they might have scheduled a matinee and evening performance back to back, but there were those pesky hours to kill in between. Now it’s possible to simply queue up a couple of streaming shows and hit play.,A natural pairing this month,combines two engaging autobiographical shows written by gifted actors looking back on their childhoods. Round House Theater of Bethesda, Md., is presenting Colman Domingo’s , which played Off Broadway in 2009. Domingo, who portrayed the bandleader Cutler in the film adaptation of , looks back at his connection to music and family while growing up gay in the 1970s and ’80s in Philadelphia. This new production is the first major one in which he himself does not appear, with Ro Boddie taking on the role. ,Across the Potomac River, in Arlington, Va., Signature Theater is presenting “Daniel J. Watts’ The Jam: Only Child.” Under Lileana Blain-Cruz’s direction, Watts (who played Ike Turner in , on Broadway) recalls growing up with his single mother in the 1980s and ’90s. The title refers to fruit spread, but sound and music energize the show, with DJ Duggz spinning onstage and acting as Watts’s occasional sidekick. ,Along the lines of MCC Theater’s beloved , in which stars perform songs they would never get to sing in real shows, this Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS annual fund-raising series features gender-reversed performances. This year’s concert mixes new numbers — hold on to your hats during the opener with Stephanie J. Block, Deborah Cox and Lea Salonga — with ones from previous editions, featuring the usual array of starry participants. ,The GPO of this docudrama title refers to the General Post Office in Dublin, which was central to the 1916 Easter Rising of Irish Republicans against British rule. Created as a centennial commemoration, Fishamble’s production takes place at the actual GPO, which in 1916 had been occupied by the rebels for several days. The company is now streaming a remastered digital version in partnership with various Irish organizations around the world, including the New York Irish Center. ,The monologuist , returns to the stage in a new piece livestreamed from the Kraine Theater in New York — in front of an in-person, fully vaccinated audience. The title (you can guess which word was omitted) neatly encapsulates many people’s stunned take on the past year. ,The Spotlight on Plays series has pulled off a fun feat with its latest reading, the first time the sisters Debbie Allen and Phylicia Rashad have acted together since the PBS movie “The Old Settler” 20 years ago. Rashad plays a grande dame of the stage, and Allen is her friend and director, in this 2019 comedy by Pearl Cleage (,). ,When many theatrical institutions curled up into the equivalent of a fetal position in March 2020, some people got to work. Among them was the enterprising reading series Play-PerView, which is celebrating its one-year anniversary with a mix of new and old works. In the first category is “Babette in Retreat” by Justin Sayre, who in the past year has been cultivating a high-camp sensibility in a steady stream of comedies like “Drowsenberg,” “When Sunny Went Blue” and “The Ducks.” There should be some choice bon mots and slapstick for Becca Blackwell, Nathan Lee Graham (as the title character), Randy Harrison (“Queer as Folk”), Bradford Louryk and Mary Testa. ,Randy Harrison also takes on the lead role of John in Studio Theater’s fully staged digital production of Mike Bartlett’s , (The actual title is just one word, so use your deductive skills). John is in a relationship with M (Scott Parkinson) when he falls in love with W (Kathryn Tkel). “Love?” a startled M says. “She?” Bartlett’s deceivingly simple premise explores the vagaries of romantic attraction, and the director David Muse makes good use of a split screen to overcome the actors’ need to maintain their distance. ,Michel Legrand’s only Broadway musical was a flop, running for only 48 performances in 2002 — which is a shame because the poetic, surrealistic “Amour,” in which a civil servant realizes he can walk through walls, has plenty of the gorgeous melodies you’d expect from the French composer. Now, , and ShowTown Productions are presenting a revival starring Derrick Baskin (a Tony Award nominee for ,), Drew Gehling (,), Kara Lindsay, Adam Pascal, Christiani Pitts and Rachel York. It is high time “Amour” gets some love. ,Don’t expect costumes of yesteryear. This project, conceived by Susan Cinoman, has enrolled an impressive roster of playwrights — among them, Ngozi Anyanwu, Bekah Brunstetter, Lisa D’Amour, Kirsten Greenidge, Lauren Gunderson, Theresa Rebeck, Sarah Ruhl and Caridad Svich — to create monologues about periods. The works, directed by Karen Carpenter (,), are spread over three evenings, and each has a unique cast; participants include Geneva Carr, Judy Gold, Julie Halston, Jessica Hecht, Mia Katigbak, Beth Leavel, Lauren Patten and Julie White. ,This play with music by Idris Goodwin revolves around the relationship between a white M.C. (Michael Knowlton) and his Black hype man (Kadahj Bennett). Their friendship goes from complicated to adversarial as they react differently to a case of police brutality, while their beatmaker (Rachel Cognata) is stuck in the middle. The show ,, but Company One’s version, presented by the American Repertory Theater, is freshly urgent, considering the past year’s debates around policing and the appropriation of historically Black art forms. ,One night in 1988, Marlene, as in Marlene Dietrich, phoned her fellow German chanteuse Ute Lemper, then starring in a production of “Cabaret” in Paris. The two women chatted for hours. Three decades later, Lemper wrote and starred in a cabaret tribute that dives into Dietrich’s life and songs. The York Theater, which hosted the show in 2019, is presenting a virtual version that was filmed at the beloved East Village boîte Club Cumming. ",1
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/movies/la-strada-film-forum.html,arts," the 1954 movie that made Federico Fellini’s international reputation and won the first competitive Oscar for best foreign film, is exemplary pop modernism — an existential parable with affinities to “Waiting for Godot,” featuring an appealingly sad clown, haunted by a forlorn musical phrase and set in the timeless landscape of windswept beaches, tattered carnivals and deserted piazzas that Fellini made his own.,It’s also a crowd pleaser, appropriately chosen as one of the movies that, newly restored, will reopen the Film Forum on Friday.,Fellini is out to break your heart from the get-go, as the wide-eyed waif Gelsomina (the director’s wife, Giulietta Masina) is sold by her impoverished mother to the itinerant carnival strongman Zampano (Anthony Quinn) as his stooge, servant and concubine.,Gelsomina’s childlike innocence is amplified by her master’s brutish behavior. While he is largely stuck with repeating a single, unimaginative stunt — ironically, it’s bursting a chain that encircles his chest — simple-minded Gelsomina delights in fantasy and spontaneous performance. In one scene, she entertains the guests and children at an outdoor wedding with an impromptu dance; in another she enchants the sisters in a convent that gives her shelter (and Zampano considers robbing).,Masina’s performance is nearly silent; unmistakably Chaplinesque with her derby, oversized coat and makeshift cane, she also evokes Stan Laurel, Harpo Marx and, as a little woodenhead, Pinocchio too. Fellini is said to have received scores of offers to make further vehicles for the character, including one from Walt Disney. E.T. may be considered among her descendants.,The New York Times , “La Strada” (The Road) as “a tribute to the Italian neo-realistic school of filmmaking,” even though, for all its desolate locations, it is far more allegorical than naturalistic. Indeed, Fellini’s metaphoric intentions are made apparent with the introduction of the itinerant tightrope walker called the Fool (Richard Basehart) who performs wearing a pair of cardboard angel wings.,Despite his annoyingly dubbed giggle, the Fool fascinates Gelsomina. When all three characters are engaged by a threadbare circus, the Fool mocks Zampano and encourages Gelsomina to join his act. That she cannot do, bound to Zampano by a mystical force that can only be termed “love.” Instead, the Fool leaves her with the poignant Nino Rota melody that becomes her theme.,Like that refrain, “La Strada” belongs to Masina. Still, before the movie ends it becomes apparent that Quinn (who took over Marlon Brando’s role in the Broadway production of “A Streetcar Named Desire,” a precursor of roughneck masculinity) has given a career performance. Indeed, the last five minutes, a coda set five years after the two part ways, are his.,“La Strada” is often sentimental and not always convincing but the ending packs a wallop. I was told the story, as a small child, by my mother who had just seen and perhaps been devastated by the movie. Although I did not fully understand it, the final scene — Zampano wading into the sea — has stayed with me all my life.,April 2-8 at Film Forum, Manhattan. 212-727-8110; ,.

Almost six years later, a documentary about the fire and its tragic aftermath has been nominated for two Oscars.,It would be the first Oscar win for the Eastern European country, but the film’s success is bittersweet for many Romanians, given its painful subject matter — particularly since many believe not enough has changed since 2015.,“Collective,” which has been nominated for best documentary feature and best foreign film, follows a group of investigative journalists from a sports newspaper as they uncover painful truths about the Romanian health care system.,“The situation was so appalling that basically it should have been a big scandal in the whole of Europe,” said Alexander Nanau, the film’s director.,Events on the night of the fire and its immediate aftermath ricocheted across Romania, toppling the government at the time — led by the Social Democratic Party — and mobilizing civil society into large-scale protests.,In the years since, however, there have been further political scandals, and few health care overhauls. The coronavirus pandemic has also put huge new demands on the struggling Romanian health care system. Two fires in Covid-19 wards in the last six months have left at least 20 people dead.,Many Romanians wonder how much has really changed since “Collective.”,While tragic, the nightclub fire is just the film’s starting point. The blaze claimed 27 lives in its immediate aftermath, but 64 people would ultimately die, many victims of a health care system awash with corruption and willing to hide painful truth from the victims and their families.,Standing outside one of Bucharest’s main hospitals, Nanau recalled: “It was basically in front of this hospital where the minister of health always stood flanked by doctors saying ‘We can treat the burn victims at the highest standards.’”,However, as the journalists found out, the burn unit was not even operational at the time, Nanau said. “It’s incredible that they have the guts to lie to all these people that their kids are being given surgery in the most modern burn unit when in fact this was closed.”,The journalists also discovered that the disinfectant used in hospitals across the country was being watered down, to the extent that it was largely ineffectual, probably resulting in many more deaths. The owner of the company involved drove his car into a tree after the truth was brought to light, killing himself.,The documentary shows in real time the reaction of the journalists after a whistle-blower sends them footage from a hospital of maggots crawling in the wound of a burn victim.,The film has been compared to both “Spotlight” and “All the President’s Men,” and in , for The New York Times late last year, Manohla Dargis described “Collective” as a “staggering documentary” that offered “no moment when you can take an easy breath, assured that the terrible things you’ve been watching onscreen are finally over.”,For people in Romania, however, much of what is shown onscreen is painfully familiar.,Catalin Tolontan, then the editor in chief of the daily newspaper Gazeta Sporturilor, is one of the main protagonists of “Collective.” Before the documentary, “We used to receive 10 or 15 messages per day from the public, with scoops or information,” he said in an interview. “After the movie we received 70 to 80 a day.”,Tedy Ursuleanu, who suffered severe burns across her head and body, and had her fingers amputated as a result of the fire, is one of the strongest characters in the film.,In an interview, she said that it was not a hard decision to let the filmmakers follow her, but that seeing the film was a painful experience. “When I saw some of the scenes, the impact was as if I lived those moments again,” Ursuleanu said. “I started to cry. I needed to go outside to compose myself.”,Ursuleanu said she believed that not enough progress had been made in the years since the documentary was filmed. “Changes have taken place, but they are few compared to the needs we have here,” she said. “Sadly, tragedies like this could easily happen again, because even now measures are not respected.”,Partway through the documentary, “Collective” introduces a young, reform-minded health minister, Vlad Voiculescu, who is brought in as part of a short-lived technocrat government.,Voiculescu and his team face strong resistance as they try to bring greater transparency to the health care system, while having to accept that the system was culpable in many deaths.,In a recent interview, Voiculescu, who was reappointed as health minister late last year, said that what frustrated him most was that on his return he found an institution that was “even more collapsed than before.” Now, Voiculescu is more focused on dealing with the coronavirus than overhauling the Romanian health care system.,“Collective,” which appeared on streaming platforms late last year, has resonated strongly with audiences around the world, especially at a time when the pandemic has made health care a central issue globally.,Nanau, a Romanian director who spent much of his life in Germany before moving back to his home country in 2015, has a track record of producing powerful documentaries. His previous film, “Toto and His Sisters,” followed the lives of three teenagers left to fend largely for themselves in one of the poorest areas of Bucharest, after their mother was sent to prison on drug charges.,But with “Collective,” he seems to have found a subject that hit at a perfect moment.,The film’s impact has also been felt outside Romania. ,, when a woman with Covid-19 was transferred from the hospital in freezing temperatures just days after giving birth, journalists began asking tough questions of the government, apparently encouraging one another on , by referencing “Collective,” which a local television station had shown days earlier. Protests followed, and the government ultimately resigned.,“If you are a journalist in a small country and saw ‘Spotlight,’ you could say, ‘Well, this is the U.S., they have a lot of resources, they have a strong democracy, they have a bond between the public and government,’” Tolontan, the newspaper editor, said. “But if you are in Mongolia or the Czech Republic, Indonesia, and you saw this movie, you think ‘They’re like us.’”,Romanian movies like “,,” “,” and “,” have received top awards at international festivals over the years, but none has won an Oscar.,Andrei Gorzo, a Romanian film critic, said that it was harder for Romanian viewers to see “Collective” as a morally clear-cut tale of a few good people fighting to change the rotten system.,Instead, he said, it captures a specific moment in Romania, when urban, middle-class voters,believed,in a new breed of politician, young and unsullied, who could clean up Romanian politics. “It is impossible for me to watch the film without acknowledging that a lot of that romanticism has turned sour since then,” he said.,Others are more optimistic.,“The generation that will change things here is not the generation that is 35-plus,” Nanau said. “It’s the younger generation, and these are the people that write to us, that we have met in the cinemas.”,Tolontan said he saw “Collective” as “a point of no return” for Romanian society.,Whether the film wins at the Oscars ceremony next month, many Romanians still hope that the film’s biggest impact will be at home, and that they can leave its content in the past.",0
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/arts/music/my-bloody-valentine-shields.html,arts,"For nearly four decades, Kevin Shields, the leader of the very loud, very fuzzy rock band My Bloody Valentine, has been described using synonyms for “eccentric” and “reclusive.” But the truth is more … what’s another word for mundane? He cooks with his wife, Anna, and they have two dogs. He listens to music on Spotify, and loves ,. He practices ,. He likes to go for walks on his sprawling property in Ireland, where he’s learned a few things about the local deer population.,“The more overconfident ones have this thing where they like to stand within 10 feet of the dogs, and make these kind of high-pitched noises like, ‘What are you going to do about it?’” he said in a recent interview.,Shields didn’t appear on camera, and the band hasn’t taken new photos since the 1990s, but he was having this conversation to make a conventional announcement: My Bloody Valentine is making the majority of its catalog available for streaming, and reissuing it on vinyl. The group has signed with the influential independent label Domino, and plans to release two new records.,“Our original plan was we would record both the albums back-to-back and then go tour on that,” he said. “And that would have been this year, you know, but everything really did slow down.”,The news, however, is still remarkable, because My Bloody Valentine has truly always done things its own way. Sometimes, that has meant calling up vinyl factories in different countries to see which manufactures the best and most specific sound. Other times, it has meant letting its label sue Shields rather than release music it didn’t like. (That happened in 2001, after My Bloody Valentine had been signed with Island Records for nearly a decade without turning out a new album.),My Bloody Valentine is most famous for elevating “,,” a dreamy style of guitar music named for the activity of manipulating the technology — literally, gazing at the pedals next to your shoes — required to conjure such a swirling sound.,The band is also famous for disappearing: After releasing its second album, “Loveless,” in 1991, it was ,, as rumors of a follow-up swelled and dispersed. After reuniting to perform live, the band surprised everyone in , a new record that appeared online in the middle of the night with no advance notice, instantly crashing the band’s website as fans swarmed to download it.,As the music industry transitioned to a streaming model over the last decade, “m b v” — along with much of the band’s earlier catalog — was not digitally available, affording it a new kind of mystery in an era when recorded music is expected to be accessible at a button’s click. “My nieces and nephews — they would complain to me, because when they would try and show their friends, they can’t find it anywhere,” Shields said. “They’re like, ‘Why are you so purposely obscure? You know, it seems stupid.’ That kind of stuff that made me think, ‘Yeah, I guess my perception of the world isn’t the world.’ There’s a whole world out there I know nothing about.”,My Bloody Valentine was formed by Shields and the drummer Colm O’Ciosoig in the early ’80s. Initially, it sounded like any number of spiky, moody guitar bands, but a few years later, Shields recruited the guitarist-vocalist Bilinda Butcher and the bassist Debbie Googe, and reconfigured the band’s sound entirely. The group became notorious for the volume of its physically overwhelming live performances, and learned how to harness that noise across a series of increasingly acclaimed releases exploring the ambient and textural potential of the guitar.,“Patience is a virtue in this band,” Butcher wrote in an email, when asked how she managed the experience of waiting to record the sequel to “Loveless.” “I had two more children and did a lot of flamenco dancing.”,My Bloody Valentine’s back catalog was previously managed by Sony, which inherited the rights after purchasing Creation Records in the ’90s. While the Sony relationship wasn’t unfriendly, the band wanted to own the rights to future releases. “We definitely wanted to work with an independent label, opposed to a major,” Shields said. The decision to sign with , was preceded by his friendship with its founder, Laurence Bell, whom he met in the mid-90s: “Domino was the ultimate kind of independent setup — they have as many facilities as most majors, but they’re owned by one person.”,Bell said he first wanted to sign Shields in the early days of their friendship, but settled for finalizing the deal in 2020, right as the Covid-19 lockdown started in the United Kingdom. “He had a very, very clear idea of what he wanted to do,” he said of Shields’ plans. “He can hear things and see things in a way few people can.”,In addition to “m b v,” the band will reissue a series of EPs recorded between 1988 and 1991 as a compilation, along with “Loveless” and the 1988 album “Isn’t Anything,” all on vinyl. And “m b v” will join “Loveless” and “Isn’t Anything” on streaming services and online stores worldwide; the EPs won’t be digitally available in North America, as those rights are held by Warner. Shields said he’d also like to reissue the band’s earliest releases, recorded with the singer David Conway, once they can be properly remastered.,Right now, the band’s members are waiting to see when they can get together in person at Shields’s home studio — O’Ciosoig also lives in Ireland, while Butcher and Googe are in England — to begin recording. If that can’t happen, they’ll explore remote options. Shields said the first of the two albums will be “warm and melodic,” while the second will be more experimental — a stark evolution from what he called his otherwise “very traditional” writing process to date.,“I’m not describing it properly on purpose,” he said, after a somewhat vague explanation. “I don’t want to give too much away because I could lay it out verbally, and then someone’s going to go, ‘That’s a really good idea.’” As for a timeline for release, he didn’t say. (“I think once I can get over to Ireland it will get done very quickly as my vocals are often the last thing to be recorded,” Butcher wrote. “They’ll probably be finished by the end of the year.”),Despite the band’s scant digital presence, new generations have continued to find My Bloody Valentine; its live audiences skew younger, which Shields counted as a nice surprise in a world where artists are encouraged to overwhelm their fans with content. “There’s always going to be a certain kind of music fan that discovers things and checks it out,” he said. “When I meet young people, I’m like, ‘Oh, I have hope for the future.’ They seem bright, and they seem alive.”,(Of the younger generation’s emergent ,, he remarked, “It’s kind of amusing because I’m literally incapable of grasping it.”),Not long after “m b v” came out, Shields worried his hearing was beginning to permanently decline, a consequence of the ,. (They pass out earplugs at shows — highly recommended.) Luckily, that deterioration has stopped, and the band has found subtle ways to mitigate the lasting effect of their loudness without sacrificing it altogether.,“For me, it’s very difficult to relate to sound but not feel it,” he said. “It’s kind of the fundamental thing of my association with music. And it seemed really strange to me that you would play live and the audience don’t get to experience the same thing that you experience.”,For years, the idea of My Bloody Valentine releasing music was treated like a distant possibility. Bell did acknowledge the inherent uncertainty of signing a band known for taking its time. But Shields has no intention of going another 22 years between releases. He mentioned artists like Paul McCartney, who’ve continued regularly recording decades after their careers began, and said working with Brian Eno on a pair of 2018 singles had encouraged him to take a more agile approach to making music.,When he was young, Shields said, he thought he needed to peak before he turned 25; after My Bloody Valentine achieved some success, he stopped thinking about time altogether, hence the long layover. Those days have passed. “Time is a bit more precious,” he said. “I don’t want to be 70-something wanting to make the next record after ‘m b v.’ I think it’d be cooler to make one now.”",1
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/arts/television/rushtix-nowhere-livestream-comedy.html,arts,"The cultural legacy of the pandemic may not only be shows canceled, careers derailed and theaters and clubs closed. There has also been innovation, like the emergence of the virtual comedy club., has matured into a new digital genre that has drawn sizable audiences in the habit of buying tickets to livestreaming stand-up from the comfort of their own homes. As clubs now start to reopen, and comics and patrons return to their old haunts, the next few months will be a key test of this business. Was it a pandemic-era fad or will it be an enduring part of the landscape?,On a video call from her San Francisco home, Jill Paiz-Bourque, the chief executive of ,, perhaps the biggest digital comedy club, made the case that the lockdown only accelerated an already inevitable revolution. “Why did Netflix eclipse television?” she rhetorically asked. “It’s streaming, unlimited, global. Why did Spotify eclipse terrestrial radio? It’s streaming. It’s global. It’s unlimited. And that’s why livestreaming with RushTix eclipses Live Nation eventually because it’s streaming, it’s global, it’s unlimited.”,Many are skeptical, including fans who badly miss being surrounded by echoing laughter and stand-ups who are exhausted by performing for screens and who widely prefer telling jokes in the same room as crowds. While conceding that nothing replaces the traditional comedy format, Paiz-Bourque said the doubts will look as shortsighted as early mockery of Twitter, podcasting and so many other now common internet forms. She has good reason for such swagger. Paiz-Bourque’s business, which she calls “a Silicon Valley start-up,” regularly sells over 1,000 tickets to see comics like Sarah Silverman, Patton Oswalt and Maria Bamford. In February, she sold 15,000 tickets to eight shows, bringing in close to $280,000 in revenue.,“Once we got our first taste of 5,000 ticket shows, that was intoxicating,” Paiz-Bourque said (Colleen Ballinger, the popular YouTuber best known for “Miranda Sings,” was the breakthrough artist).,As touring resumes, Paiz-Bourque is tweaking her vision, moving away from a tight focus on those headlining and radically increasing volume. By the summer, her goal is to produce five shows a day, every day. In other words, to live up to the slogan that appeared on her site before a recent show: “The biggest comedy club on the planet.” She said she wasn’t worried about clubs reopening because “I have way more supply than they have access to.”,In the next month and half, she’s rolling out nine original, interactive series, including competitions (“Very Punny With Kate Lambert”), a cooking show (“Baking It Better with Tom Papa”) and a dating one (“Find Your Boo With Reggie Bo”). She’s also adding closed captioning, a subscription package and new technology that allows patrons to move around the “club” and hear different levels of laughter.,The overall vision is to produce new work with emerging artists during the week while doubling down on headliners on Friday and Saturday nights. How will she compete when stars are eager to tour and return to live stages? Simple, she says: Make comics offers “worth their while.” After previously offering 80 percent of tickets sales, she’s recently started guaranteeing up to five figures. She says six figures will become common among an elite few. “I’ve gotten pushback on this from Day 1,” she said about enlisting comics. “Then you start wiring thousands and tens of thousands of dollars and they were like: I get it.”,RushTix is hardly the only player in this market. ,, a smaller, scrappier operation that was started by the comedians Ben Gleib and Steve Hofstetter, has booked a stellar lineup of comics, including Mike Birbiglia, Gilbert Gottfried and Nikki Glaser. In something of a coup, Bill Burr recently performed in a benefit production from a studio that Gleib built in his home, a booking that Paiz-Bourque said she was “devastated” she didn’t get a chance on. (She just announced that Burr will be appearing at RushTix on May 16 in a live version of the animated TV show “Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist.”),Gleib, who began Nowhere after ending a presidential campaign in 2019 that left him nearly broke, also performs his own show online every week. And while he is optimistic about the future of livestreaming, he sounded more anxious than Paiz-Bourque about losing comics to touring. “I think we can peaceably coexist,” he said. But as he approaches Nowhere’s anniversary next week, his strategy is not to rebrand or recast so much as make Nowhere fit more seamlessly into the existing ecosystem.,He recently started geotargeting, a technology that restricts consumers from certain areas from buying tickets, a tactic he called potentially “game-changing.” This enables a comic heading out on a tour to block the places he’s visiting so as not to depress sales there.,Emilio Savone, the co-owner of the New York Comedy Club, which begins indoor shows on Friday, when the city will begin allowing indoor shows at 33 percent capacity with a limit of 100 people, said such digital theaters have a future. “Do I think it can sustain as a seven-night-a-week type of thing? Maybe not?” he wrote in an email. “But I do think it’s a good tool for comedians to work on material, and it offers another way for the comic to engage and reach their audience.”,Felicia Madison, who runs the West Side Comedy Club in Manhattan — which will begin outdoor shows on April 14 but not indoor shows until the city allows for 50 percent capacity — also sees a future involving a hybrid of traditional and digital clubs. “If they’re smart, they’ll work with clubs” to livestream from there, she said.,RushTix is already doing that, with the stand-up comedian Godfrey performing from the Gotham Comedy Club on April 7. But neither Paiz-Bourque nor Gleib sound enthusiastic about the economics of such arrangements. Gleib argued that strength of Nowhere was in the relationships it has developed with new comedy audiences. “We’ve reached huge demographics that have never been serviced by comedy clubs,” Gleib said, pointing to patrons who live in remote areas or those with disabilities or social anxiety. “Then there’s the lazy,” he added. “We’re great for lazy people who don’t want to go out.”,Nowhere puts fans’ faces onscreen and allows everyone to talk, laugh or even heckle (though they can muted for that, too). This creates a freewheeling show that emphasizes the community of audience and performer. By contrast, RushTix keeps the audience to a chat room and limits laughter to 20 people. Gleib called this “elitist,” saying the RushTix approach didn’t resemble live stand-up.,Paiz-Bourque doesn’t argue, saying that since no online show can duplicate a live one, her goal is to produce the best experience. “We gave up on trying to emulate the live experience and the more we gave up on that, the more we started opening up barrels of creativity,” she said.,If anything, she wants to move away from a dependence on conventional stand-up, while still booking big names. It’s why one of the first comics she recruited was Bamford, a natural experimentalist who is putting on an unusual show on April 17: after doing a set, she will film herself sleeping for the next eight hours. You can watch and join her for breakfast the next day.,Bamford already has a dedicated audience that will follow her wherever she goes. The real test for these clubs will be whether they can develop enough loyalty to get audiences to try less established talents. These platforms tend to benefit those who already have large and engaged online fan bases. When clubs and theaters return, they are going to be booking acts that they know can sell tickets, which may make them more wary of adventurous or emerging comics.,There is a real danger right now that we are entering a very cautious moment in comedy as institutions struggle to rebuild, and Paiz-Bourque, a former comic gifted in the art of selling a premise, argues now is the moment for her to fill another niche.,Pointing to a logjam of early- and midcareer stand-ups whose careers have been slowed by the pandemic, she said, “Not only is this going to be a business that works. It needs to creatively for all these comedians.”",1

Her most recent book, , describes the personal and political repercussions of the depredation of public lands.,For our chat, I chose the “Abyss of the Birds” section from Olivier Messiaen’s “Quartet for the End of Time.” She picked “First (Solo Voice)” from Keith Jarrett’s “Invocations.” These are edited excerpts from the interview.,I hear it as breath. I knew the story before I knew the music, and I was struck by how, in the presence of war, you could have two minds: one watching out for the enemy and one listening for the call of a blackbird or a mockingbird. And when I first heard it, I was just devastated by the beauty.,That first note appears to come out of nowhere and then builds through the power of one breath. Especially now, in the time of coronavirus, as a country we can’t breathe. We can’t breathe because of the virus. We can’t breathe because of politics, because of the Black and brown bodies that are being killed on the streets. And here, there is that one opening breath, and at the beginning, it feels like melancholy, it feels like a lament. But then as it progresses, there is that building of the silence to voice that becomes a lighter voice, the voice of birds, a fluttering and flourishing.,It also felt like light. I had heard that the piece was created at dawn, so this morning, I took my music outside and sat in the desert. As light spread, against that building of voice, it felt like the music mirrored the dawn itself. And I was absolutely stunned by the birds that were drawn in. The robins were the first ones. At moments, I couldn’t tell: Was that a fluttering from Messiaen or a fluttering from the robins? Then starlings came in, and it was almost like they were trying to copy the music, and then the desert mourning doves came in. And then the larks took over.,Sitting in this grove of junipers, I thought about Messiaen and his musicians creating this music in a time of such confinement — and that is the power of community.,I was a child in 1962, when my grandmother read Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring.” We were in her garden putting seeds in bird feeders. And she said, “Terry, can you imagine a world without bird song?” It was a terrifying thought. Birds allow us to be present in the moment, but they also link me to a time before the human record and to what will be as we live our own apocalypse in terms of climate collapse. So they’re an arrow pointing in both directions.,That is a beautiful paradox I hear in his music. Birds are the ultimate symbol of freedom. They are also the symbol of presence. They hold their past, and we pray that they will carry the earth into the future. Here he was a devout Catholic, and yet he sought his spiritual source not from God but from God’s creation.,He slows their song down so we can really hear. And birds feel like they are the mediators between us and heaven. I also think that since birds travel within the realm of air, to choose a clarinet, a single reed instrument that requires breath, is such a beautiful manifestation.,The two pieces feel interlinked. They’re both single-reed, solo voices. One is highly composed, the other born of improvisation. And both of them felt like invocations. With Keith Jarrett’s solo, it was the echo that moved me most. This energetic vibration that I feel especially attuned to now as we are a year into a pandemic that we first thought was a pause and we now know is a place. The echoes we feel in our isolation, our own solo voices.,Jarrett invites us to ask how well can we live with uncertainty. He offers us a path of improvisation, and the echo turns it into a call and response.,It’s in the listening that you open up creative space. I was astonished by a passage about two minutes and 50 seconds in, where the music builds to this fullness. For a while, I lost all track of time.,If someone were to say, “Tell me where you live, what do you experience,” I would point to this piece. It is this spaciousness. It is the echo of wall against wall in the narrow confines of these red-rock canyons.,Both of these pieces are filled with memory. How do we access that? For me the bridge is silence and stillness.,As harrowing and as grief-filled as this pandemic has been, it has brought us to this place of slowing down and listening. And that has been part of the blessing. If we are going to survive, that is what is required.",1
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/arts/design/museums-timed-tickets.html,arts,"The other morning, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Vincent van Gogh and I had a chat. I asked him about the straw hat and blue cravat he had on: Was he going for an urban bohemian look, or was it all about coming off as an outsider? We had a frank exchange about his mental state. He was looking a bit wound-up — I’d heard rumors about some strange behavior — but his eyes seemed bright and untroubled. Of course we mostly went on about his art. Where did his work fit into his era’s modern painting? Was a next step toward abstraction in the back of his mind?,I admit that it had been a long time since I’d tried to commune this deeply with van Gogh’s , from 1887, one of the Met’s treasures. For years, every time I’d gone to pay it — him — my respects, the crowd of admirers made it impossible to get near enough, for long enough, for us to achieve any real understanding. But over the last few months, with Covid restrictions severely limiting attendance, the world’s most famous museums have given their art a new opportunity to speak to us.,This is the moment to revisit the holdings of our great art museums: Even if their special exhibitions start to fill up again, it will be a while before crowds come to their permanent collections. As museums everywhere contemplate their post-Covid future, their Covid-troubled present carries us back to a glorious, more art-friendly past.,On my very first visit to New York’s great museums, almost four decades ago, you could look at just about any work without much in the way of distraction or obstruction. My parents, the most die-hard of modernists, had raised their kids on abstraction alone, so I needed all the calm I could get to come to grips with how people-pictures like van Gogh’s self-portrait, or the celebrated Rembrandts down the hall, could even count as art.,My teenage self didn’t stick to the Met. At the Museum of Modern Art, I remember being thrilled by its modernist landmarks: Picasso’s shocking “Demoiselles d’Avignon,” Matisse’s magical “,,” Pollock’s frantic “,.” Visiting them again on a recent Thursday afternoon, in an almost empty museum, I felt like we’d barely been apart. Whereas on many a visit over the past decade, I’d felt as if I was trying to hang out with high-school friends grown so famous they could barely be approached through their entourage.,The other afternoon at MoMA, it felt almost bizarre to plant myself in front of the “Demoiselles"" for as long as I wanted, without worrying about blocking all the people behind me. (There weren’t any.) I got to do the kind of prolonged, thoughtful,looking it takes to really make a painting come alive — to move beyond the preconceptions and clichés that all of us arrive with and actually look, with fresh eyes, at what the picture might be about. Contemplating the “Demoiselles,” from 1907, which was credited with pushing Picasso toward his Cubist revolution, I had the leisure to ask myself why, at the last minute, he’d made the faces of some of the women look like African masks. That move gives us so much trouble today, as we come to grips with the West’s brutal history of colonialism and racism — and, as I realized the other afternoon, ,. The painting would have looked fine without those Africanisms; Cubism could have happened without them, as well.,Even that Thursday, in ideally uncrowded conditions, it wasn’t easy for me to clear my head enough to take in the “Demoiselles,” so imagine all the young people who have come to MoMA for the first time amid pre-Covid throngs. What chance did they have to think much of anything as they elbowed their way into the presence of this supposed “great art.”,For a while now, I’ve been talking about art objects as “machines for thinking”: Our job as viewers is to switch them on, and it’s almost impossible to do that when all you’re getting is a glimpse through the gaps in a crowd.,All this is doubly important with work that’s so new to you that you don’t even have clichés to fall back on. That was my situation one recent morning, when I paid my first visit to the great old Frick Collection in , on Madison Avenue. (The Frick’s old masters are due to live there for a couple of years as the collection’s Beaux-Arts mansion is renovated.),Like the Met and MoMA, over recent decades the Frick has become a victim of its own success. As tourism to New York exploded, the domestic spaces of the old Frick almost always seemed packed to full capacity, making it nearly impossible to start any kind of fresh conversation with its glorious Vermeers and Titians. The crowding could make it hard even to notice the less famous works, tucked into far corners that you sped by. As most every critic has said, the Breuer has given the Frick’s masterpieces new room to breathe; its “lesser” objects now have the chance to draw your attention.,Because of Covid restrictions, I was almost alone when I came upon Renaissance bronzes that I’d barely known in their old home. ,, by the sculptor known as Antico, was all gleaming surfaces; the hair was a delicious pile of gilt curls. A nearby bronze by Giovanfrancesco Rustici, on the same subject, had a rough surface that seemed almost corroded. As I looked and thought, an explanation came to mind: Both were trying to conjure up images of bronzes by their artistic ancestors in ancient Greece and Rome. Antico was imagining how glorious those bronzes must have looked when new; Rustici made his new works look like they’d been buried for 1,500 years.,I won’t say I’m thankful to Covid for anything; a few wondrous hours with art can’t make up for what we’ve suffered. But as I think of all we’ve learned from our trials — how to wash our hands; how to treasure absent loved ones — I wonder if our most popular museums will take their own Covid lessons to heart.,Will they try to return to 2019 attendance and ticket receipts, or will they think back even further in time, to the close encounters that people once managed to have, in peace, with the art? If getting back to that state means that we visitors must reserve a limited supply of timed tickets, as we do under Covid — if it means that museums have to rethink or reverse decades of growth in buildings, budgets and programing — the art works themselves will thank us for it. They were growing tired of constant socializing; they’ve been dying for some deep, one-on-one conversation.",1

While large-scale shows at arenas and stadiums may not come back full-throttle until 2022, promoters and talent agents, encouraged by the speed of vaccinations, have begun laying the groundwork for what may be a surprisingly busy summer and fall of concerts at clubs, theaters and outdoor spaces.,For now, there may be just a trickle of events. Starting Friday, New York State will allow entertainment venues to reopen at , of their regular capacity, up to 100 people for indoor spaces. Throughout the country, rules from local governments have kept many clubs and theaters closed, or allowed them to operate at reduced capacities — which for many of those places does not allow enough business to cover the basic costs of operating and of paying artists and employees, said Audrey Fix Schaefer of the 9:30 Club in Washington.,“The only thing worse than being totally shuttered is being partially reopened,” said Fix Schaefer, who is also the communications director for the ,.,But many artists are said to be planning tour announcements soon, and hungry venue owners — buoyed by the prospect of $10 billion in federal relief through the , fund, which they can apply for starting April 8 — are eager for the business.,The relative handful of clubs and theaters set to reopen in the spring are doing so with altered seating plans, temperature checks and adjusted financial deals with performers. A recent rock concert in Spain, with extensive Covid-19 protections, drew ,. These events are being watched closely by the concert industry, which went into 2020 anticipating its biggest year ever but ended up losing nearly $10 billion in box office revenue, according to data collected by Pollstar, a trade publication.,City Winery, a restaurant and concert venue on Pier 57, on the West Side of Manhattan, is reopening Saturday with a performance by the singer-songwriter Rhett Miller; it has been gradually filling out a calendar of socially distanced shows, confirming some just days ago. (Rufus Wainwright, Steve Earle, Patti Smith and Stephin Merritt of Magnetic Fields are among those on the ,.) Tables have been arranged to allow space between parties, and patrons, who must wear masks when not seated, will get their temperatures checked upon entry.,“Even if it’s for 100 people, it takes on such a significance to be putting on a show,” said Michael Dorf, the venue’s founder. “It feels like a sacred job, putting on culture.”,Miller, a regular performer at the dozen City Winery spots around the country, said that he had struggled with the forced grounding from Covid-19, though he also noted the silver lining of spending more time with his family. The idea of playing live again, he said, both excites and terrifies him.,“I’ve been dreaming about it night after night, climbing up on a stage in front of people,” Miller said. “The dreams are fraught and weird. Half the time I’m trying to sing through a mask, or I’m in trouble for not wearing a mask.”,Major tours, which typically require months of planning and the hiring of a large crew of workers, have largely punted to next year or even 2023. That should make the next couple of years an extraordinary time for live music, with dozens of superstar acts planning to reschedule postponed tours and make up for lost time. But it may also be a test of touring infrastructure and of fans’ willingness to buy tickets to multiple high-profile shows.,“The amount of stadium activity in 2022 is something I’ve never experienced,” said Jay Marciano, the chairman of AEG Presents, one of the industry’s biggest promoters and venue operators. “Over a dozen major artists are actively holding real estate for next year.”,The fate of summer festivals, an important bellwether, is still uncertain. Some, like the Newport jazz and folk festivals, in Rhode Island, are planning to go on this year, with reduced capacities. Bonnaroo, in rural Tennessee, is planned for September, with Megan Thee Stallion, Lizzo, , and others; Summerfest in Milwaukee, a major urban concert series, is also planned for September. But whether Lollapalooza in Chicago will go forward is ,.,In New York, a smattering of clubs are also planning shows, like Bowery Electric and the Bitter End. But the majority are holding out for when they can reopen at full capacity, or close to it, many proprietors said. The industry has been placing its bets on summer or fall for that.,Still, many artists and promoters report watching every news blip about infection spikes and virus variants with trepidation.,The British electronic duo Jungle has announced a , at large clubs like Brooklyn Steel in New York and the Anthem in Washington. Sam Denniston, the group’s manager, said that all signs have pointed toward that being feasible, as millions more people get vaccinated and more venues fully reopen. Yet uncertainty about the pandemic means that anything could happen.,“It’s kind of like penguins sitting on the edge of a cliff, and they push one in to see if there’s a killer whale in the water,” Denniston said. “I kind of feel like we’re that first penguin. But someone’s got to take the risk.”,While stadium-sized artists are counting on the pandemic coming under control and the full revival of a mothballed industry by the time they hit the road, for many others below the superstar level, a year without shows has simply been long enough.,“I don’t know if I can wait another six months to a year,” Miller said, “to do my job again.”",0

Now, it’s Feb. 15, I’m heading for Sydney to work with the Australian Ballet.,My calendar for spring 2020 was a color-coded puzzle. I’d wanted to take advantage of every opportunity that came our way, knowing it wouldn’t be like this forever. I didn’t know it would all be over so suddenly.,Traveling reminds me of my dad, who died in 2018. If he were alive, we would have talked all week about what time I was leaving for the airport. I can hear him now saying “leave earlier … it could take an hour , to get across town” in his Brooklyn accent. He was early to all of my performances. He would show up, opening the theater doors: “Pammy, can you believe I got a parking spot?” Or he’d tell me how he took the express bus from the Bronx all the way down to the East Village.

I’m scared for dance; I’m scared for the arts and I’m scared for New York. The city is wounded.,I’m traveling halfway across the planet to walk into a studio of unmasked dancers to create a dance for a real live audience. It’s incredible — heartbreaking — and I will not let this moment pass unsavored.,When I get to Sydney I’ll have to quarantine for 14 days in a hotel. Real quarantine. Lockdown. No going out for a walk or to pick up a few groceries. Maybe this will help me with the new dance. Limitations and boundaries have always focused me. I like rules, but also like to break them — and quarantine is a rule I can’t break.,Sometimes I set limitations for myself on purpose. I purged walking out of all my dances for five years when I realized I was relying on it too much. I had to re-earn my right to walk in my dances. I also banned entrances and exits for a while. What will I ban after quarantine?,I have no structure for my day. To keep focused, I’ll make a schedule, and start following it tomorrow.,I FaceTime with my daughter, Gemma, at college. I miss her. I’m still wearing my Pink Floyd T-shirt and sweats that I put on last night … yesterday … two days ago … in New York.,The reality that I just traveled 24 hours and can’t leave my room hasn’t hit me yet. There is a guy posted in the hallway, making sure no one leaves. The Australian Department of Health is also going to call every day to ask after my health — both Covid-related and mental.,Before I left, I ran around trying to remember everything. I forgot a notebook, which had notes I took while talking to , about her score for the ballet I’m making, “Watermark.” Darn.,The beginning of making a dance is my favorite part — the research. While in quarantine, I’m going to start drawing the dance, scoring the space first. (It looks something like football plays — birds-eye views of the stage space.) Separately, I keep track of movement and rhythmic ideas.,The more organized I am, the more I can go “off book” when I actually get in the room with dancers. Then process becomes part of the dance. I love watching dancers warm up and am always on lookout for “mistakes” they make. I like incorporating these into the design of the dance — little glimpses of humanity within the abstractness of the choreography.,I’m making two dances at once — one for Australian Ballet and one for Singapore Dance Theater. The Singapore dance will be made on Zoom and the one for Australian Ballet in person! Both dances will be performed for a live audience!,I’m jet-lagged and thinking in fragments. So much to figure out, including what time of day it is and whether I should be awake or asleep.,I’m up at 3:30 a.m. to teach my choreography class at Rutgers on Zoom, 4:30-7:30 a.m. (That’s 12:30-3:30 p.m. in New Jersey.) I’ve showered and put on a shirt and a little makeup, so I don’t scare my students. They’re making dance films and rehearsing on Zoom, so I’m talking to them about using limited resources as an advantage — inspiration from limitation — just like I’m dealing with now.,I give them problem-solving movement exercises, and I try to give them hope. The trajectory of dance in America is forever changed after these months of isolation, cancellation and reconsideration. I believe dance is — and will have to continue — reinventing itself for the post-Covid world. The students will be entering a much-changed creative environment than the one I entered after college. I grapple with how to prepare them when I have no idea what’s coming.,I try to do a few different kinds of exercise a day. Something aerobic, something for arms. I brought my own weights.,The novelty is already wearing off and it’s only Day 3. I still haven’t made a schedule, but the time gets filled with the routine calls and door knocks of quarantine.,The nurses call every day to ask if I have any Covid symptoms and if I need to talk to a doctor about anything. Today, the nurse asked me where I had traveled from, and it turned into a 25-minute conversation about how he loves dance, how he used to dance, and his trip to Africa. It was nice to chat. I loved hearing his Australian accent even though I only understood half of what he said.,I had my Covid test. I had to stand against my opened door in profile while they swabbed my throat and nose. Brain tickle.,Food delivery, a.k.a. “Knock and Drop”: They deliver meals to me twice a day — no ordering or choosing. (I’ve opted out of breakfast since they bring hazarai, bready junk food.) I don’t know who “they” are; they knock on the door and leave.,It’s nice not to have to order. Choreography is a series of choices I have to make so to get a break from that is OK.,The food has been a mixed bag. Today’s lunch: a “New York beef sourdough sandwich” and a banana.,I had the worst dream last night. I was trying to move my body but couldn’t — stuck in one place. My daughter was with me, running ahead of me and I couldn’t catch up.,I’m still jet lagged, I still have no schedule, still get confused by the time difference, still need to choreograph two dances. And I should call my mom.,I brought “Swann’s Way” with me. I’ve tried reading this maybe 10 times. I thought I could try again in quarantine. I want to be a person who can read Proust but I guess I’M JUST NOT. A writer friend suggested that I open the book and read a sentence or two randomly. That is the only way to do it, like a John Cage/Merce Cunningham “chance procedure.”,Today, I made four phrases of “ballet” steps using chance as a starting point for the structure. I want to go deeper with the dancers when I see them. That’s the collaborative part and most satisfying part of making dance — doing it in the moment, relying on my intuition.,I had my first Zoom rehearsal tonight with Singapore Dance Theater. Melissa Toogood, a good friend and the longest collaborator in my company, came from New York to be my assistant. She helps out from her room on Zoom. I’m excited to start, though I’m not sure yet how I’m going pull this off.,I woke up later today — 6 a.m.!,And a major change: I moved my computer location from the desk facing the wall to the table facing the windows.,The thing about making two dances at once is if you get stuck on one you can change to the other and still feel productive. I have two new notebooks bought from Amazon Australia. Each dance gets its own notebook for ideas and stage drawings.,I know it’s a little corny, but I like having quotes from artists I admire with me. It’s spiritual company, making me less lonely and giving me something to aspire to. I write this , on the first page:,“Content is never more than an extension of form and form is never more than an extension of content.”,As concepts, movement ideas and structures form first. These then inform the dance, so I never have to “decide” what movement goes into which dance if I’m working on two at the same time — the dance tells me.,While on a FaceTime call today with Gemma, she tells me about her writing class. Her assignments deal with a strict form. This is fascinating to me, so I question her more on the specifics and ask her to send me the writing prompt. It sounds so similar to what I do — making similar prompts for myself and creating movement within its structure.,It’s 2021, it’s a pandemic, and I’m in Australia. I’m not “well-traveled” but making dances has given me the opportunity. My first time to Europe was for my honeymoon in Paris. I was 28. It was 1998 — we made our hotel reservations by fax. After that, not much else, only little trips.,The first 25 years of my dances were made and performed in New York City. In 1992, my first show was at CBGB’s gallery. We danced barefoot, so I would go around before the show pulling nails out of the floor with a hammer. We were treated like a band and we got a cut of the door.,Now I’m 51, getting hot flashes and still making dances.,The halfway mark! And a day off.,Watched Truffaut’s Antoine Doinel series (“The 400 Blows,” “Antoine and Colette,” “Stolen Kisses,” “Bed and Board,” “Love on the Run”).,It’s 5:45. I’m waiting for the knock. I wonder what’s for dinner?!,I did not work on any projects yesterday. I feel guilty. My first therapist used to say, “Pam, you wear guilt like a sweater.” Guilt is a cozy place for me, and it’s not productive.,Today I’m more productive. I took a shower.,We had a good rehearsal with Singapore. Translation and articulation of movement is tough and tedious on Zoom, but the dancers are picking up the steps quickly.,I’m still trying to capture a “real life in the studio” feeling. When the dancers created an amazing tableau — all were looking at the camera to hear what I was saying — I had to include it in the dance.,It’s a busy day in quarantine: two rehearsals; a costume fitting on Zoom; and an interview about the new ballet. I’ve never been so busy without leaving a room. I’m also going to do two , workouts, cardio and a 20-minute arm sculpt. I read that middle-aged women need to lift weights and do strength training, so I try to do this every day.,My rehearsal with Australian Ballet, the first, goes well on Zoom. I started plotting it out with 14 men and three women — 17 altogether — my homage to Balanchine’s “Serenade” (minus the principal roles). My dance will be sandwiched between two Balanchine ballets on the program and I’m trying hard not to think about this.,I explained a little about my work to the dancers, but I could hear the reverb of my nasal American/New York/Jewish accent. I hope it didn’t scare them. Melissa and I got through one phrase during the hour. It’s good prep work for when I see them in person next week.,My Pink Floyd T-shirt is still in heavy rotation.,Melissa is leaving quarantine. I will miss her! Even though I never actually saw her, knowing she was here helped. Reid Bartelme (costume designer) is here now, so I call him on the landline. He says, “Pam, we have cellphones,” but I like the land line.,I just signed into Zoom for my noon rehearsal but no one is there. Ah, noon Singapore time, 3 p.m. for me … oy! Working in three different time zones, I’m surprised this hasn’t happened before now.,Feeling unfocused today.,Another beef pie for lunch … bummer.,I try to say hi to the guard in the hall. That’s me, trying to connect. One thing my dances are “about” is disconnection — missed connections and making that disconnection work.,After being isolated like this, I’m curious about how being confined to this space will (or will not) affect my work.,See ANY day, 1 through 11. It’s all the same.,“The house shelters daydreaming, the house protects the dreamer, the house allows one to dream in peace.” (Gaston Bachelard),I can hide here in quarantine.,At 9 a.m., I open my door to two police, two border force guys and a hotel guard. I say, “Wow, I need five guards to check out?” And they laugh and say, “We heard you were trouble.”,I’ve realized in this room that when I meet the Australian Ballet dancers I will have no rules. I will make a dance. Freedom.",1

We all are so worried for our loved ones. My mother goes on walks every morning and evening. She’s 75-years-old. A couple of weeks ago, I bought a blond wig for her, and I said, “You know, just wear it when you go outside, wear a hat, wear glasses.” She tried it on.

That’s why I came here, because I was a misfit back home.” And he says to me, “Well, you don’t look American.” I looked at him, and I was like, “You mean to say I don’t look white?”,“It’s OK,” I said. “I’ve been in business in America for 20 years. I’m a citizen. I make more than 90 percent of my clothes in New York City. I am actively involved in social causes. I’ve contributed to my taxes.”,Needless to say, I didn’t get the investment.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/nyregion/trump-vance-investigation.html,business,"State prosecutors in Manhattan investigating former President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization have subpoenaed the personal bank records of the company’s chief financial officer and are questioning gifts he and his family received from Mr. Trump, according to people with knowledge of the matter.,In recent weeks, the prosecutors have , on the executive, Allen H. Weisselberg, in what appears to be a determined effort to gain his cooperation. Mr. Weisselberg, who has not been accused of wrongdoing, has overseen the Trump Organization’s finances for decades and may hold the key to any possible criminal case in New York against the former president and his family business.,Prosecutors working for the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., are examining, among other things, whether Mr. Trump and the company falsely manipulated property values to obtain loans and tax benefits.,It is unclear whether Mr. Weisselberg would cooperate with the investigation and neither his lawyer, Mary E. Mulligan, nor Mr. Vance’s office would comment. But if a review of his personal finances were to uncover possible wrongdoing, prosecutors could then use that information to press Mr. Weisselberg to guide them through the inner workings of the company. The 73-year-old accountant began his career working for Mr. Trump’s father.,Separately, the prosecutors are also seeking a new round of internal documents from the Trump Organization, including general ledgers from several of its more than two dozen properties that the company did not turn over last year, according to the people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details.,The ledgers offer a line-by-line breakdown of each property’s financial situation, including daily receipts, checks and revenues. The prosecutors could compare those details against the information the company provided to its lenders and local tax authorities to assess whether it fraudulently misled them.,Mr. Vance’s office has also subpoenaed records from several banks where Mr. Trump or his company had accounts, including JPMorgan Chase and Capital One, according to people with knowledge of subpoenas served on the banks.,The previously unreported developments underscore the escalation of the investigation after Mr. Vance’s office obtained Mr. Trump’s tax records and other underlying financial documents in February. They were released over Mr. Trump’s objections after a lengthy legal battle that culminated in a ,.,The Trump Organization declined to comment. In the past, Mr. Trump, a Republican, has denied any wrongdoing and has slammed the investigation as a long-running and politically motivated “fishing expedition.” Mr. Vance, a Democrat, recently announced that ,.,The investigation has centered on some of Mr. Trump’s most prominent properties: Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, the Trump hotels in New York and Chicago and the ,. In addition to possible tax- and bank-related fraud, the prosecutors are examining the Trump Organization’s statements to insurance companies about the value of various assets.,Prosecutors have subpoenaed records from a firm hired by Deutsche Bank, one of the former president’s main lenders, to assess the value of three Trump hotels with Deutsche Bank loans, people with knowledge of the matter said. The firm reviewed the operations of restaurants, bars and gift shops at the hotels, one of the people said.,Last year, the prosecutors , Deutsche Bank itself and Mr. Trump’s other main lender, Ladder Capital, which sold its Trump Organization loans years ago. Both banks are cooperating with the prosecutors.,It is unclear whether the prosecutors will ultimately file any charges. But if a case were built against the Trump Organization based on the loan documents, the company’s lawyers could argue that Deutsche Bank and Ladder Capital are sophisticated financial institutions that conducted their own analysis of Mr. Trump’s properties without relying on the company’s internal assessments. The lawyers could also emphasize that providing different valuations for a property depending on the situation — for example, on a loan application or in appealing local property taxes — is common and appropriate in New York’s real estate industry, in part because there are varying methods for calculating property values.,Outside accountants also vet the information provided to local tax authorities, potentially reducing the likelihood of fraud. Mr. Trump has argued that his tax returns “were done by among the biggest and most prestigious law and accounting firms in the U.S.”,In addition to the fraud investigation, Mr. Vance’s office continues to focus on its original target: the Trump Organization’s role in paying hush money during the 2016 presidential campaign to two women who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump.,Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, paid $130,000 to buy the silence of one of the women, Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress who performed as Stormy Daniels. The Trump Organization later reimbursed Mr. Cohen, and Mr. Vance’s office has scrutinized whether the company properly accounted for the $130,000 payment.,Mr. Cohen, who in 2018 pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance charges for his role in the hush-money scheme, has long implicated Mr. Weisselberg, alleging that he helped devise a strategy to mask the reimbursements. The federal prosecutors who charged Mr. Cohen did not accuse Mr. Weisselberg of wrongdoing.,Mr. Cohen is now cooperating with Mr. Vance’s investigation and has met with prosecutors several times, including to review some of Mr. Trump’s financial documents. Lanny Davis, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen, declined to comment.,The prosecutors have also questioned Mr. Weisselberg’s former daughter-in-law, Jennifer Weisselberg, she has said. Ms. Weisselberg has been enmeshed in a bitter divorce with Mr. Weisselberg’s son, Barry, who manages the Trump Wollman Rink in Central Park.,Ms. Weisselberg said in an interview that prosecutors have asked her about a number of gifts that Mr. Trump and his company gave the Weisselberg family over the years. These include an apartment on Central Park South for Ms. Weisselberg and her former husband, cars leased for several family members and private school tuition.,The scrutiny of the gifts appears to be part of an effort to paint a picture of Mr. Weisselberg’s financial life, as is common when prosecutors seek cooperation from a potential witness.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/health/esophageal-cancer-nivolumab.html,business,"For decades, esophageal cancer has defied scientific attempts to discover a therapy that extends patients’ survival, year after year claiming the lives of such illustrious people as Humphrey Bogart, Christopher Hitchens and Ann Richards, the former governor of Texas.,Now a , offers hope, finding that a drug that unleashes the immune system to attack cancer cells can double the disease-free survival times in patients from 11 months to 22 months. The study was published on Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.,“It is a game changer,” said Dr. David Ilson, an esophageal cancer expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who wrote , accompanying the research. “We’ve waited a long time for this.”,In the trial, sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb, 794 patients in 29 countries were randomly assigned to receive infusions of the drug, nivolumab, or a placebo.,The patients had all had chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery to remove their cancers. As usually happens, pathology reports showed that the surgery did not remove all of the cancer cells, which still lurked in lymph nodes and elsewhere, setting the stage in these patients for their cancers to return as incurable metastases.,Nivolumab is approved for some patients with other cancers, like Hodgkin’s lymphoma, melanoma and colorectal cancer. With the new study, experts expect the drug will readily win approval for treatment of early-stage esophageal cancer.,Dr. Ronan Kelly, director of the Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center at Baylor University Medical Center and lead author of the new study, said he and the other researchers urgently wanted to help the 75 percent of patients who go through extraordinarily difficult sequences of radiation, chemotherapy and surgery that disfigures the digestive system, only to learn that cancer is still present or has a high likelihood of recurring.,Without some other form of treatment, “we knew many would recur quickly,” Dr. Kelly said. Additional chemotherapy not only was difficult for patients to tolerate, but it also did not seem to help. Nivolumab has few side effects and seemed worth a try.,Esophageal cancer is rare in the United States, accounting for 1 percent of all cancers; about 15,000 patients die each year. But it is the seventh most common cancer globally, and frequently seen in East Asia, although it is not clear why, Dr. Ilson said.,Smoking is a risk factor, but researchers do not think the high smoking rates in China, for example, explain the high incidence. “We don’t think it’s environmental,” Dr. Ilson said.,Other risk factors include alcohol consumption and acid reflux disease.,Because the cancer is so rare in the United States, it has not gotten much research attention. While new treatments have revolutionized prospects for other cancer patients, those with esophageal cancer could only look on longingly.,That has weighed heavily on people with the disease, said Mindy Mordecai. Her husband, John, died of esophageal cancer in March 2008. She started an advocacy group called Esophageal Cancer Action Network.,“You can’t even imagine how demoralizing it is to see all the progress around you. ‘Please sir, may I have some more gruel?’” she said, quoting Oliver Twist, the Charles Dickens character in the eponymous novel, asking for a pittance.,The new findings must be seen in the context of what patients go through when they develop esophageal cancer, experts said. Most learn they have the cancer after it has progressed to a point where they are unlikely to survive.,But every patient hopes to be one of the lucky ones. “Our patients are always waiting for the other shoe to drop,” Ms. Mordecai said. “You have to understand what it’s like to live with that every day.”,The first step for most is chemotherapy and radiation. The treatment is so harsh that an oncology nurse told Mr. Mordecai it “brings Navy Seals to their knees,” Ms. Mordecai recalled.,The chemotherapy has difficult side effects, and the radiation causes a burning sensation that makes it difficult to swallow. “Food won’t go down,” Ms. Mordecai said. “You just feel rotten.”,The next step is major surgery. A doctor takes out most of the patient’s esophagus, the tract leading from the mouth to the stomach, and then grabs the stomach and pulls it up, attaching it to a stump of esophagus left behind.,The result is a stomach that is vertical, not horizontal, and lacks the sphincter muscle that normally keeps stomach acid from spilling out. For the rest of their lives, patients can never lie flat — if they do, the contents of their stomach, including acid, pours into their throats. They can choke, cough and aspirate.,Recovery is difficult, and morbidity and mortality are high. But most patients go through with the operation once they weigh their options. To refuse the treatment means giving up and letting the cancer close off the esophagus to the point where some cannot even swallow their own saliva, said Dr. Paul Helft, a professor of surgery and an ethicist at Indiana University School of Medicine.,The treatment is so long and harrowing that Dr. Helft often uses it to teach medical students and other trainees about informed consent — about how patients must be fully informed before they start any given treatment.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/archegos-stock-market-swaps.html,business,"After the implosion of a little-known investment firm saddled banks around the world with billions of dollars in losses last week, one big question is being asked all over Wall Street: How did they let this happen?,The answer may stem from the way the firm, ,, with ample assistance from at least half a dozen banks, made bets on stocks without actually owning them.,Archegos used esoteric financial instruments known as swaps, which get their name from the way they exchange one stream of income for another. In this case, Wall Street banks bought certain stocks Archegos wanted to bet on, and Archegos paid the banks a fee. Then, the banks paid Archegos the stocks’ returns.,These swaps magnified the fund’s buying power, but they also created a two-pronged problem. Archegos was able to build up much more influence over the share prices of a few companies, including ViacomCBS and Discovery, than it could afford on its own. And because there are few regulations about these types of trades, it was under no disclosure obligations.,When those bets soured last week after the shares of some of the companies in question fell, it touched off a miniature crisis: The banks that had let Archegos amass such big holdings furiously sold the stocks to protect their own balance sheets, and the flood of cheap shares pushed the stocks’ prices down even more. And Archegos itself imploded.,The blind-side hit sent a shudder through the financial system and stuck banks with losses that some analysts say could reach $10 billion. And, for a time, it had Wall Street worried that problems could cascade.,“The disclosure system doesn’t cover any of this,” said Dennis Kelleher, chief executive of Better Markets, a Wall Street watchdog group. “These derivatives are designed for synthetic exposure which de facto conceals ownership interests.”,As banks tally up their losses and shareholders smart over the hit to their portfolios, the tactics that Archegos employed will draw the eye of regulators and renew calls for further regulation of swaps and similar financial products, called derivatives.,The Securities and Exchange Commission has said it was monitoring the situation, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the meltdown of Archegos had “all the makings of a dangerous situation.”,“We need transparency and strong oversight to ensure that the next hedge fund blowup doesn’t take the economy down with it,” she said in an emailed statement.,Archegos was actually a family office, set up to manage roughly $10 billion by Bill Hwang, who previously led a hedge fund that , under his leadership. But it used leverage — essentially, trading with borrowed money to amplify its buying power — perhaps as much as eight times its own capital, some Wall Street analysts calculated.,In this case, leverage showed up in the form of swap contracts. In return for a fee, the bank agrees to pay the investor what the investor would have gotten from actually owning a share over a certain period. If a stock rises in price, the bank pays the investor. If it falls, the investor pays the bank.,Archegos focused its bets on the share prices of a relatively small number of companies. They included ViacomCBS, the corporate parent of the country’s most-watched network; the media company Discovery; and a handful of Chinese technology firms. The banks it used to buy swaps held millions of shares in ViacomCBS alone.,Normally, big institutional investors are required by the S.E.C. to publicly disclose their holdings of stock at the end of each quarter. That means investors, lenders and regulators will know when a single entity holds a big ownership stake in a company.,But S.E.C. disclosure rules don’t usually cover swaps, so Archegos didn’t have to report its large holdings. And none of the banks — at least seven that are known to have had relationships with Archegos — saw the full picture of the risk the fund was taking, analysts say.,The use of stock-related derivatives has been rising sharply in recent years. The amount of outstanding equity derivatives — including swaps and a related instrument known as a forward — on stocks listed in the United States more than doubled from $50 billion at the end of 2015 to more than $110 billion during the first half of 2020, ,, according to the Bank for International Settlements, an international consortium of central banks.,The use of swaps and other kinds of leverage can supersize gains when investments pay off. But when such bets go wrong, it can quickly wipe out an investor.,That’s what happened last week. Several stocks that Mr. Hwang’s firm had bet on started to fall, and the banks demanded that he put up additional money or other assets. Known as “margin,” this is a cushion of cash meant to ensure that the bank doesn’t lose money if the stocks fall. When he was unable to do so, the banks dumped millions of shares of stock they had purchased.,The effect on share prices was profound: ViacomCBS fell 51 percent last week and Discovery 46 percent. Shareholders in those companies saw the value of their holdings plunge; more than $45 billion in shareholder value was wiped out of those two stocks alone. And banks lost money on any shares whose value had fallen. Kian Abouhossein, a J.P. Morgan analyst, estimated that banks lost $5 billion to $10 billion in their dealings with Mr. Hwang.,Credit Suisse may have lost $3 billion to $4 billion, Mr. Abouhossein estimated. The Japanese bank Nomura Securities has said it is exposed to losses of as much as $2 billion. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have said they expect minimal losses — meaning it won’t seriously affect their financial results — but for such large entities that could still mean millions of dollars. ,, a unit of the Japanese financial conglomerate, reported a potential loss of around $270 million.,Analysts say the damage was relatively contained, and while the losses have been large for some players, they’re not big enough to pose a threat to the broader financial system.,But the episode will most likely reinvigorate a push to expand the regulation of derivatives, which have been associated with many prominent financial blowups. During the 2008 crisis, the insurance giant AIG nearly collapsed under the weight of unregulated swaps contracts it wrote.,The cascade of problems that began with Archegos was only the latest example of derivatives’ ability to increase unseen risk.,“During the financial crisis of 2008, one of the biggest problems was that many of the banks didn’t know who owed what to whom,” said Tyler Gellasch, a former S.E.C. lawyer who heads the Healthy Markets Association, a group that pushes for market reforms. “And it seems that happened again here.”,Matthew Goldstein, contributed reporting.",4
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/fashion/sustainability-clothes-environment-technology.html,business,"Sustainability in the fashion industry was once the focus of only a handful of designers like Stella McCartney and outdoor gear companies such as Patagonia.,But traditional and new brands are trying to improve a supply chain increasingly criticized for contributing to landfills and causing other forms of pollution throughout the manufacturing process.,From collaborating on the creation of biofibers to the manufacturing of environmentally friendly tag fasteners, some in the apparel sector are working with technology start-ups to clean up the world’s closets.,The biggest problem rests with the volume of unwanted clothing that winds up in landfills. According to the ,, which works to foster sustainability, clothing production globally roughly doubled from 2000 to 2015. During the same period, the number of times a garment was worn declined by 36 percent. All told, “the equivalent of one garbage truck full of clothes is burned or dumped in a landfill every second,” their report found.,Over roughly the same period, according to the ,, 60 percent more garments were purchased, but consumers kept them for only half as long.,But some companies, like H&M, are trying to increase their own sustainability while also encouraging consumers to keep garments out of the trash. At H&M’s flagship store in Stockholm, for example, customers,can pay a nominal amount to have unwanted clothing transformed into new garments through a process that breaks down the old fibers and combines them with new ones.,The eight-step process is designed to make a point, not a profit. “We want to engage our customers and make them understand that their own garments hold value,” said Pascal Brun, H&M’s head of sustainability.,But traditional mechanical recycling that is in wider use has its limits. “As shiny as the fashion industry is on the outside, the supply chain has often relied on 19th-century equipment,” said Stacy Flynn, the founder of ,, a start-up based in Seattle. Companies like Ms. Flynn’s seek to reduce fibers to their basic chemical components and build them back up with less impact.,Evrnu’s first product, which Ms. Flynn said she hoped would become commercially available this year, converts the cotton in garments to lyocell, a cellulose fiber that is now made only from wood.,The process, called NuCycl, will update the initial recycling step of sorting, grading and shredding fabric by adding a camera that can more accurately identify a fabric’s composition. Decorative trim, the content of the label or even the thread used can reduce the cotton content by as much as 20 percent.,“It’s like the difference between cooking and baking — you can be looser with ingredients when cooking, but with baking you must be precise,” Ms. Flynn said. “It’s the same way with chemical recycling — if you know what you’ve got, you can optimize the process.”,The heart of the technology lies in the next step, at the pulp mill, where the shredded fabric is dissolved and turned into pulp. That pulp becomes a thick paper, to be shipped to the next part of the textile supply chain, the fiber producers. There it is repolymerized to make lyocell.,Evrnu has partnered with several brands, including Adidas and Ms. McCartney, to use the recycled fibers in their fabrics. “When the consumer is done with it or if the brand is stuck with a dog, those garments can all come back into the system, be repolymerized and turned into something new,” Ms. Flynn said.,Another area of interest involves new fibers and materials that rely on products that are found in nature but not derived from animals.,Several companies, for example, are developing alternatives to leather, since hides are particularly problematic, from the methane-producing cows that produce it to tanning methods that often involve toxic chemicals like chromium. Vegan leather, despite its environmentally friendly name, is no better because it uses plastic, said Theanne Schiros, a materials scientist and an assistant professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.,One alternative is mushroom leather, which relies on mycelium, or mushroom roots, to produce an animal-free alternative. Mycelium has been used for thousands of years in a variety of ways, Dr. Schiros said, even to dress wounds, but , and designers have set their sights higher.,In addition to Bolt Threads, a fiber and material producer that gained attention last fall when it announced its ,, others companies, like ,, are developing “leathers” from mycelium.,MycoWorks’s chief executive, Matthew Scullin, said that while the company was exploring uses in automotive upholstery, the current emphasis was on apparel and footwear.,F.I.T.’s Dr. Schiros is part of a team at Columbia University working on a bioleather alternative; the latest prototype, she said, is “a naturally dyed, microbe-grown sneaker that is a part of Slow Factory’s One x One initiative,” referring to the nonprofit that works on sustainability and climate issues.,The pandemic has forced her to work from home, rather than at a lab, but she has found a clever workaround.,She used her backyard to test how well the bioleather that had been treated with their plant-based tanning technology would break down — in this case, decomposition is a good thing. After burying the sample she tested the mass of the material, as well as the pH and the nutrients of the soil, for 60 days.,Her home-based experiment, she said, found that after seven days the “samples had visibly deteriorated, were smaller in size and had lost over 70 percent of their mass.”,Dr. Schiros is also a co-founder and the chief science officer of ,, which is developing a wool fiber alternative. Started by three of her former students at F.I.T., the company seeks to create biodegradable fibers based on the DNA of proteins that already exist in nature.,Dr. Schiros has worked as well on an , also begun at the school, which is part of the State University of New York. Research is done in collaboration with Columbia, where Dr. Schiros has a research scientist appointment.,Companies hoping to provide “cradle to cradle” solutions — the term used for processes that intend to keep materials within a circular economy, mindful of the end state of materials at the start of the design process. That is the idea behind ,, a footwear maker that uses primarily recycled materials, said the company’s co-founder Chloe Songer.,Thousand Fell also wants to make it easier for consumers to recycle their shoes. “You can do some great design thinking and great production, but if you’re not set up to actively collect product, it’s a little bit in vain,” said Stuart Ahlum, the company’s co-founder. To that end, in November, Thousand Fell teamed up with UPS to provide consumers with an easier way to recycle their worn-out footwear.,Ultimately these developments will transform the fashion world as long as customers buy in. The look and feel — as well as the price — have to work. “If we could make a shoe for $400 but no one buys it, it defeats the purpose,” Mr. Ahlum said.,Additionally, being environmentally friendly is not enough. As Dr. Scullin of MycoWorks said: “There is an expectation floating around that consumers are willing to sacrifice quality for sustainability. But they’re not.”",0
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/sports/baseball/los-angeles-dodgers.html,sports,"It is not yet opening day. Therefore, the Los Angeles Dodgers remain on top of the world.,They are the defending World Series champions, and they are favored by oddsmakers to become the first team in two decades to win back-to-back titles. Success has become routine. The Dodgers have won their division for eight years running and have appeared in the World Series three of the past four seasons, a run that no other current team can touch.,While noting how difficult it is to slog through the regular season and prevail in the crucible of flukiness that is Major League Baseball’s playoffs, Dodgers executives remain cautiously optimistic they can win again. “I think we are poised as having as good of a chance as we have ever had,” ,, the team’s president of baseball operations, said from spring training last week.,The partners of Guggenheim Baseball Management, which bought the Dodgers in 2012, have figured out how to consistently win, for now at least. While Friedman stays up at night worrying about his bullpen and how to restock the farm system, the rest of the Dodgers’ front office has visions of transcending mere baseball.,But to do so they will have to create a new generation of baseball fans that go beyond the white boomer demographic that typifies the sport’s core audience — surveys regularly find that fans of baseball are , and , than fans of other sports — and attract loyalists across one of America’s most racially diverse cities, where Latinos, Asians and Black people make up more than two-thirds of the population.,The Dodgers proudly carry the legacy of Jackie Robinson, not to mention having reached broader audiences in the past thanks to the Fernandomania caused by Fernando Valenzuela in the 1980s and the worldwide attention spurred by Hideo Nomo in the 1990s. These days, even having Magic Johnson, the most popular man in Los Angeles, as one of the Dodgers’ owners might not be enough to captivate the diverse pop culture tastemakers who will dictate the next decades of cultural relevance.,While 2020 saw the Dodgers reach a pinnacle as team, Los Angeles has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, both in terms of deaths and the economic toll of shutting down the theme park and movie businesses. The Dodgers have been central to the city’s efforts to combat the virus, feeding, testing and vaccinating hundreds of thousands of Angelenos at Dodger Stadium, which might, in turn, strengthen the team’s bond with its city.,“We have a moral and social responsibility to have a strong community relations program, but also, it’s just good business,” said ,, the team’s president and chief executive.,But even when things are booming in Los Angeles, the competition for attention is tough. “We are competing against sports teams, we are competing against the beach, we are competing against Disneyland,” ,, the team’s executive vice president and chief marketing officer, said on a video call from his home. The sheen of the Dodgers benefits from celebrity fans, Rosen said, pointing to team acolytes like Rob Lowe, Jason Bateman and Omar Miller.,Financially, things are complicated. The Dodgers, like all other baseball teams, have lost money during the pandemic. Commissioner Rob Manfred has said teams collectively lost $3 billion last season, an average loss of $100 million for each team. But the higher you reach the farther you fall, and the Dodgers regularly lead baseball in attendance — they drew just under four million fans in 2019, nearly 500,000 more than any other team — and have one of the most lucrative television rights agreements, ,. Kasten would not reveal the amount the team lost during the 2020 season, but it is safe to say it was much more than $100 million.,Yet the Dodgers continue to invest in the team when so many of their competitors are looking for ways to cut costs.,A longtime executive with the Atlanta Braves and the Washington Nationals, Kasten helped lead the purchase of the Dodgers in 2012. Mark Walter, chief executive of Guggenheim Partners, is the controlling owner, and Peter Guber, Johnson, Billie Jean King and others all own parts of the team.,But Kasten is the central cog of the organization, and the recent financial losses haven’t changed things for an executive who spent the past nine years perfecting a three-part philosophy that he hopes will result in more World Series titles — and a Dodgers cap on every head in the world.,The product is the team, and a good product is a team that wins. That is the domain of Friedman, who was hired away from the Tampa Bay Rays in 2015.,With the Rays, Friedman focused exclusively on low- or zero-cost team-building strategies, likening himself to a specialist doctor. “We knew our limitations,” he said. ,With the Dodgers, every team-building strategy is available to Friedman, which means he is expected to put a winning team on the field in perpetuity.,“There are a lot of large-market teams that have gone on a nice run, and then gotten to the end and fallen off a cliff,” he said. “It takes them three, five, six years to build back. We are trying the delicate balance of maximizing for current wins, while also keeping one eye on the future.”,So far he has done remarkably well. Many baseball teams in recent years — even the Boston Red Sox and the Yankees — have looked for ways to cut back on payroll, but not the Dodgers. They have kept their payroll among the highest in baseball, and have been willing to make moves like trading for the superstar Mookie Betts, knowing they would have to re-sign him to an astronomical contract, which they did, to the tune of $365 million.,But their payroll is not bloated with many expensive long-term contracts, and their farm system is regularly one of the best in baseball. Half of their World Series-winning roster was originally drafted or signed by the Dodgers, led by their ace, ,, but also including key contributors like , and ,.,, the team’s manager, seems content with what he has to work with.,“It’s a very talented team,” he said. “That is an understatement.”,Kasten talks often about having visited Dodger Stadium on his honeymoon in the late 1970s. He jokes, or maybe he’s serious, that when Guggenheim bought the team, the original electric and plumbing from 1962 remained. Multiple renovations in recent years, including $100 million worth of upgrades completed during the pandemic, have rectified that. Dodger Stadium now has the amenities expected of modern ballparks, like a robust Wi-Fi network.,It also now has a two-acre “entertainment concourse” with a statue of Robinson (and one to come, of Sandy Koufax), with photos retelling the team’s history and plenty of backdrops for fan selfies. The concourse was supposed to be unveiled on opening day last year, but that day never came and the area won’t be used initially this season because of restrictions meant to discourage fans from congregating.,The team has finally corrected perhaps its biggest early mistake, which centered on its enormous television rights agreement with Time Warner Cable. The money was not the problem, exactly, but to recoup the $7 billion investment, Time Warner charged a high fee for the channel, which cable and satellite distributors did not want to pay. As a result, for many years fewer than half of Los Angeles households could watch Dodger games.,You cannot find new customers if they cannot watch the games, and Kasten is clearly still angry at the various media companies involved in the situation. Through a series of media mergers and new agreements, Kasten says the team’s games are now available in over 90 percent of Los Angeles homes.,“Brand” is an often nebulous and cliché term, but for the Dodgers it seems to mean regular people interacting with the organization. That can be the players — who in nonpandemic times were encouraged to sign autographs, and some once greeted fans at the stadium gates until it became too unruly — or the larger team, through its investment endeavors and community relations program.,When ,, a veteran philanthropy executive, was hired as the chief executive of the Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation in 2013, the foundation’s focus was on developing softball and baseball fields in local underserved communities. The foundation had one other employee and had spent on its philanthropic efforts $9 million in the previous two decades.,Under her leadership, the Dodgers Foundation has invested $23 million in building and maintaining fields, developing underserved communities, homelessness and hunger relief, and social justice initiatives. (The foundation organizes and executes its own projects and also gives grants to other organizations.),The money gets spent on building and maintaining ball fields as well as serving the families of the local youth who play on the fields with job training, college application counseling, fitness clinics and dental health screenings.,“We are not responsible for putting butts in the seats at Dodger Stadium,” Whiteman said, “but inherently and indirectly that occurs. It’s our job to let those who live in the shadows of Los Angeles know that they belong and are connected to the Dodgers.”,Achieving diverse representation in all aspects of the organization remains an aspiration. Amid a , in the number of Black pro baseball players, the undisputed star of the team, Betts, is Black, as is the manager, Roberts, one of two Black managers in the league. (He is also of Japanese descent.) The team also has a number of Latino players. The front office, where ownership and the decision makers sit, is much whiter, however.,But then there is Johnson, a key figure on the ownership team.,“What is really outstanding, and you hear it all the time, is that I’m sitting there,” Johnson said.,Asked how the team can attract the younger, diverse fans, executives like Kasten and Rosen pointed to the team’s community relations initiatives, but had less to say about how it plans to attract the middle-class and wealthy people of color who aren’t yet tuning into Dodger games or showing up at the stadium.,While the Dodgers will celebrate the team’s connection to agents of change like Robinson and Johnson, no one should expect the Dodgers to weigh in on divisive cultural and political battles, even as , that brands reflect their values. In last summer’s protests for racial justice, the Dodgers saw a “bright line” that placed the issue squarely on the side of morality, not politics, Kasten said, but the organization will steer clear of any issue its sees as incendiary or political.,, the Dodgers’ president of business enterprise, is in charge of using the Dodgers name and money to invest in technologies as prosaic as point-of-sale kiosks, and as newfangled as blockchain and ,. But central to the organization’s success is the investment in players. “We have to make sure we’re as competitive as possible on the field.” he said.,Johnson, through his time with the Lakers and the Dodgers, knows more than most about how Los Angeles sports franchises operate. He said the work to be done now, with the Dodgers’ first game of the season coming on Thursday against the Colorado Rockies, was to stay focused on the improved physical and economic health of the community and the continued health of the team’s athletes. That comes before discussions of World Series repeats.,“What we have to remember is we have 162 games to play first,” he said.,After all, the product is the team, and the product must be good.",2
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/sports/football/nfl-adds-17th-regular-season-game.html,sports,"The N.F.L. formally agreed to add a 17th regular season game on Tuesday, the first expansion of the league’s schedule since 1978.,To make room for the extra game, the league’s owners removed one preseason game, leaving three for each team. The upcoming regular season will begin on Thursday, Sept. 9 and end one week later than usual, on Sunday, Jan. 9, 2022. Super Bowl LVI, which will be played in Inglewood, Calif., will also move back one week, to Sunday, Feb. 13, 2022.,Teams will continue to have only one bye week during the season.,Team owners approved the expansion at an annual meeting held virtually, but the new calendar structure had been all but guaranteed to move forward after the league announced on , with CBS, Fox and other media companies. The ,, reached in March 2020, gave team owners the option to add an extra regular season game if the league signed at least one new media deal.,With the addition of a 17th regular season game on top of the two extra playoff games the league added last season, the N.F.L. negotiated substantially higher rates for its media rights. The new deals, which total more than $100 billion, nearly double the amount of the expiring contracts.,“One of the benefits of each team playing 17 regular-season games is the ability for us to continue to grow our game around the world,” N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement.,During negotiations on the labor contract last year, ,, opposed adding a 17th regular season game. The owners ultimately won over reluctant union members, who approved the agreement by just 60 votes, with players getting a bump in their share of the N.F.L.’s revenue, up to 48.5 percent from 47 under the old deal.,Some players remain opposed to a longer season. Denver Broncos safety Kareem Jackson called the ,. New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara ,to convey his displeasure, before tempering his reaction by,, “17 games still dumb,” on the app.,Goodell said in a conference call with reporters that players would still play a total of 20 preseason and regular season games. Injury rates, he said, are higher during preseason games, so eliminating one could lead to fewer injuries. Most established players, though, play only sparingly during the preseason, when coaches prefer to evaluate free agents and rookies as they vie for roster spots.,On Tuesday, the owners also approved a rule that would require all 32 teams to play an overseas game at least once every eight years. This will allow the league to schedule up to four neutral-site games each year outside the United States starting in 2022. Teams like the Green Bay Packers have been reluctant to play internationally because they did not want to give up the revenue from a home game and because of the stress of additional travel. In recent years, some franchises have been willing to play games in London and in Mexico City in exchange for the right to host a Super Bowl. The new rule would end that trade-off.,As the league looks to grow the game’s international footprint, N.F.L. executives said it may also return to playing games in Canada, as well as in South America and elsewhere in Europe, including Germany. Chris Halpin, the N.F.L.’s chief strategy and growth officer, said finding a Canadian stadium that meets the league’s specifications for hosting a game remains an issue.,The 17-game regular season will give half of the N.F.L.’s teams an extra home game each season. For simplicity’s sake, the 17th game will be hosted by all teams from one conference on a rotating basis. In 2021, every A.F.C. team will host nine regular season games, while N.F.C. teams will host eight. In 2022, N.F.C. teams will get the ninth home game.,As usual, teams will play home and away against their three divisional rivals for a total of six games. Interdivisional games within the same conference will continue on a rotating, three-year cycle, interconference games, on a four-year cycle. Remaining games will be determined based on the prior year’s standings.,The newly added 17th game will be between interconference teams based on the prior year’s standings. A first-place team from one division will face a first-place team from a division in the opposing conference that it had not been scheduled to play based on the usual scheduling rotations.,That will lead to some intriguing interconference games in 2021. The Green Bay Packers, for instance, winners of the NF.C. North last season, will travel to Kansas City to play the Chiefs, who won the A.F.C. West. The Seattle Seahawks, winners of the N.F.C. West, will play the Steelers in Pittsburgh, while the , will play the Colts in Indianapolis.,The N.F.L. will announce the dates and times of all these games in the coming weeks.",2

They’ll even cheer you on when you spend wisely and remind you your bills are coming due.,These are the newest evolution of personal financial management tools, with the emphasis on personal.,Such money management software is not new; ,, the granddaddy of the industry, started in the 1980s to make bill-paying and budgeting easier and evolved as the industry did. Two of the top apps, , and ,, are more than 10 years old.,But as artificial intelligence has become ever more sophisticated, these tools — and almost all of them are apps — have proliferated; it’s almost impossible to say how many there are, but new ones seem to be coming on the market almost daily.,They are “more intuitive, more developed,” said Chanelle Bessette, a banking writer at ,, a personal finance website that also offers its own budgeting , “These apps are getting to know their users a lot better — users are feeding them information about how they spend, and that helps the predictions become even better.”,The apps are essentially looking to become almost as good as a live personal adviser, but one that you don’t pay much for and that can live in your pocket. Some charge a monthly or annual subscription; others are free and make money through referral fees they collect when a user buys the financial products or services promoted on the site.,“Their mission before was to make it easier for consumers to budget, but now they’re really creating features that enable consumers to buy stocks, apply for loans and autosave all on one platform,” said Anisha Kothapa, a fintech analyst at CB Insights, which tracks business trends.,Companies are trying to stand out in a crowded marketplace, and while some are bundling more features to attract users, others aim to specialize.,Such apps are particularly popular for budgeting and setting goals; in this area, Mint, , and , often top “best of” lists.,Like all these tools, they require a user’s credit card, banking and other financial information to track spending and income levels and then automatically sort them into categories.,Each offers something a little different. Mint provides free credit score checks as often as you like (it’s a “soft” check, so it won’t hurt your credit score). You Need a Budget, also known as YNAB, relies on a system called zero-based budgeting, where every dollar is put into an account, such as holiday spending, emergency fund and so on, so that you end up with zero.,“We really want people to be proactive, rather than reactive,” said Jesse Mecham, founder of YNAB. “People think that budgeting means they forecast what they’re going to make and what they’re going to spend; we teach people to budget only with the money you have on hand right now. We want people to change their behavior, and that comes with changing their thinking.”,Other tools are more focused on automatic savings and investing; they have become increasingly creative and game like. , connects with a web-based service, , which allows users to set up rules for saving and investing.,For example, the Qapital app can connect to your Fitbit so that every time you hit a goal (walking 10,000 steps) or fail to meet one (not sleeping enough), you put money toward one of your savings or investing goals.

Taking a pass near midcourt, Carrington faked a drive to her right and then curled, left, around the elbow at the foul line and down the left side of the lane. Met near the baseline by UConn’s Aaliyah Edwards and Olivia Nelson-Ododa, Carrington spun and rose for a shot with four seconds left.,And this is where opinions begin to differ.,The shot never reached the rim. Carrington crashed to the floor. No whistle blew.,UConn’s players raced upcourt, ,. Baylor’s players and coaches pointed to the spot of the collision, exasperated. Coach Kim Mulkey threw her arms out wide, frustrated.,And Carrington rose to one knee and, stunned, asked the one question so many were asking: What?,“I personally don’t see it as a controversial call,” Carrington said. “I’ve seen the replay, and one girl fouled me in my face and one girl fouled me in my arm.”,She was even more direct ,.,“You can’t swallow your whistle when the game is on the line,” she wrote. “Film does not lie.”,“What did you see?” a reporter asked Mulkey in her postgame news conference.,“What did you see?” Mulkey snapped back, teeing up a response she knew was coming. Told by the reporter that, in her opinion, the lack of a foul call had been a surprise, Mulkey lit into the decision.,“Then write it like that,” ,. “You don’t need a quote from me. I’ve got still shots and video from two angles. One kid hits her in the face and one kid hits her on the elbow.”,Mulkey wasn’t alone in that opinion. As UConn celebrated its 69-67 victory, a conversation was raging: Was it a foul? Had the referees robbed Baylor, and handed UConn the win?,W.N.B.A. stars thought it was a foul.,Former UConn stars thought it was a foul.,Even LeBron James thought it was a foul.,But, crucially, the referees did not think it was a foul. And neither did UConn Coach Geno Auriemma, whose team booked its 13th straight trip to the Final Four. He was in no mood to look over his shoulder at the details.,He laughed off the criticisms on social media. , for thinking a controversial late-game call was unusual.,“I probably doubt,” Auriemma said of James, “that in his career he’s ever won a game and decided to give it back because he looked at it and went, ‘That was a foul.’”,He also detailed a handful other curious calls, and noncalls, during what had been a physical affair between Baylor and UConn for 39 minutes 58 seconds before Carrington rose for her final shot.,“We probably fouled a number of times during the game and we didn’t get called for it,” Auriemma said. “They probably fouled a number of times during the game and didn’t get called for it. We got free throws because of nonfouls. You could go back and forth through the whole thing.,“The bottom line is the officials did what they’re going to do.

There are many outlets experimenting with ways to get a handle on the online adult education marketplace, including community colleges and universities, for-profit learning platforms, workshop providers and nonprofit organizations.,The new platforms are also opening doors to more adults. “There are already tons of people who, once upon a time, by dint of age or circumstance, wouldn’t traditionally have gotten the chance to partake in education, but can now sign up for free online courses,” Mr. Yoquinto said. Participants can choose a class here and there, without strapping on a backpack and heading to campus or signing up for expensive degree programs.,Virtual learning has become “the great equalizer,” said Gene O’Neill, the chief executive of the ,, which provides continuing education for veterinarians around the world. “Because of virtual learning, veterinary professionals everywhere, even in remote, undeveloped countries, can learn from the world’s most renowned leaders and virtually participate in conferences,” he said. “This puts learning on an equal platform for everyone regardless of geography, income or time constraints.”,Ms. Livingston’s goal was to improve her skills so she could become a paid teacher on the GetSetUp platform, which offers classes — all taught via Zoom by teachers older than 50 — on skills from professional development to technology, health, wellness and hobbies like photography.

By the time you get that certificate, the skill is already outdated. We’re changing that model.”,Ms. Livingston, who lives in York, Pa., signed up to learn how to use Zoom to host classes, how to manage and lead an online class and how to teach Google Classrooms. “Seniors everywhere were in lockdown and were eager to learn and connect,” she said.,Because she’s interested in cooking and eating healthy meals, Ms. Livingston eventually began teaching classes such as “Great Dinners in 30 Minutes or Less,” “Healthy Eating on a Budget” and “Healthy Desserts That Are Delicious, Too.”,In January, Oasis, a nonprofit educational organization, launched , with a menu of online classes on subjects from art to writing. ,, a unit of ,, or OATS, is a nonprofit resource for people 60 and older that offers courses and lectures.,OATS was founded in 2004 in New York City as a community-based project for older adults focused on tech education.

Louisville had a clear shot at Stanford, but the top-seeded Cardinal came back — and then some — in the second half.,Both Stanford and South Carolina, No. 1 seeds in an N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament field that has commanded a fair share of difficulty for teams at the top, moved on to the Final Four on Tuesday night to join another No. 1 seed, UConn, and third-seeded Arizona.,Stanford claimed the last spot in the national semifinals with a 78-63 defeat of Louisville, after trailing by 12 points at halftime. South Carolina sailed in the round of 8 with a 62-34 win over Texas.,In the ultimate sign of futility after a run that included upsets of U.C.L.A. and Maryland, Texas scored 0 points in the fourth quarter — missing all 15 of its shots. The Longhorns shot 23 percent for the game.,The Gamecocks dominated from the start to earn their third trip to the national semifinals and their first since winning a national title in 2017.,“When we got knocked down four times this season, they got back up stronger,” South Carolina Coach Dawn Staley said in a television interview after the game, referring to the Gamecocks’ four losses this year. “And that’s the mark of a true champion.”,Louisville’s Dana Evans put up 10 of her 24 points in the first quarter while the Cardinals kept Stanford below 28 percent shooting in the first half.,But a 13-0 run toward the end of the third quarter put the Cardinal ahead as they started containing Louisville’s top scorers. Then, Stanford ran away over the last 10 minutes. Lexie Hull had 21 points and 9 rebounds while Haley Jones had 10 points and 10 rebounds.,Stanford’s Ashten Prechtel, who finished with 16 points and made all six of her shots, opened the fourth quarter with a 3-pointer that bolstered Stanford’s confidence and sparked a decisive run.,“It was tough to not play in the first half — and I was nervous,” Prechtel said about Louisville’s lead. At halftime, Prechtel said Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer “ripped into us a little bit” and told them they had to “compete in the second half” if they wanted to stay in San Antonio.,“Coming out of halftime, there was urgency to how we were going to play,” Prechtel said.,According to the N.C.A.A., two Black women will be head coaches in the Final Four for the first time: Staley for South Carolina and Adia Barnes of No. 3 Arizona, which will face UConn in the national semifinal.,“There are so many Black coaches out there that don’t get the opportunity, because when A.D.’s don’t see it, they don’t see it,” Staley told reporters after the game, referring to athletic directors. “They’re going to see it in the Final Four on Friday night.”,“Representation matters, and its nothing against anyone else who lost to us,” she added. “I hope that the decision-makers — because there are a lot of jobs out there — that you give Black women the opportunity.”,Staley’s team weaved through Texas’ notorious defense with ease, with Zia Cooke and Destanni Henderson repeatedly feeding Victaria Saxton in the paint. Cooke led with 16 points, and added 6 rebounds and 3 assists. Henderson had 12 points and 7 assists, while Saxton had 12 points and 8 rebounds.,The Longhorns got into gear briefly in the third quarter as more and more Texas fans trickled into the audience after work hours, bolstering the cheers and outcries that bounced around the cavernous stadium walls at the Alamodome.,Audrey Warren, who led Texas with 13 points, scored two of her — and the team’s — three 3-pointers in the third quarter. And at one point, Texas came within 10 points of South Carolina on a second-chance layup by Lauren Ebo.,But that was as close as the Longhorns got after South Carolina took an early 15-point lead and scored 14 points off Texas turnovers. Looking exhausted and downtrodden after Warren scored their final points in the third quarter, the Longhorns let South Carolina celebrate early with a big run while they continued to watch their shots bounce off the rim, not adding a single point to their score in the final 10-minute period.,“It was hard for me to not get too excited,” South Carolina’s Cooke said of the last quarter in a call with reporters after the game.,It was the first scoreless period of the women’s tournament since the N.C.A.A. switched from halves to quarters in 2016, according to the ,.

The Bulldogs ,, but , for its only championship. Staley beat Schaefer in 12 out of their 15 meetings while they were Southeastern Conference foes.,“I always look forward to playing Vic because of what he puts into his scouting reports, his game-planning and his scheming,” Staley told reporters on Monday.,Even without the pandemic, Texas went through significant transition this summer when Schaefer took over for longtime coach Karen Aston. Players recalled struggling to get to know each other and their coaches during video calls and limited practices, and said that has helped them bond and peak at the right time within the controlled environment set up for the tournament.,It was a relatively quiet night for South Carolina sophomore forward Aliyah Boston and Texas junior center Charli Collier, who had both averaged double-doubles this tournament and went head-to-head on Tuesday night. Boston, who is up for a few player-of-the-year awards, had 10 points and 8 rebounds; Collier, who is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the W.N.B.A. draft, was held to 4 points after missing 8 of 10 shots.,Boston also had a slow start during South Carolina’s round-of-16 game against Georgia Tech but picked it up in the second half where she scored all 9 points. But in that game her teammates stepped in, led by Cooke on the perimeter with 17 points in a 76-65 win.,With its powerhouse defense, Texas was also able to hold No. 2 seed Maryland to its lowest score of the season in a , by limiting the Terrapins’ possessions and forcing 11 turnovers.,The fans helped too, Schaefer said. The university, located in Austin, is about 80 miles from San Antonio, the hub for the tournament where most of its games have been staged. “I thought our fans provided a great environment for both teams,” Schaefer said Monday.,South Carolina will play top-seeded Stanford.

McDavid, racing up on Byron to the left, crossed in front and appeared to target Kotkaniemi even though he no longer had the puck.,A split-second before they collided, McDavid drove his elbow into Kotkaniemi’s shoulder, and then connected with his jaw.,Here’s a wide angle view.,Kotkaniemi, a 20-year-old center, fell to the ice in a heap, clutching his face.,McDavid was given a two-minute minor penalty for roughing.,And Twitter in Canada, which until that point had predominantly been focused on the coronavirus pandemic’s , and the plucky Toronto Blue Jays’ , this week, turned its attention to a discussion for and against McDavid, complete with calls for suspensions and fines and Zapruder-film , of the hit.,By late Wednesday morning, the N.H.L. had announced that McDavid had been fined $5,000 for elbowing Kotkaniemi, the maximum allowable under the collective bargaining agreement. He began trending all over again.,But McDavid, who leads the N.H.L. with 63 points and ranks second in goals with 21, also had his defenders.,McDavid is known for his , and , — his goals often must be watched repeatedly in slow motion to fully appreciate — but he was visibly frustrated early on Tuesday night. His mood had perhaps carried over from the previous evening, a 3-2 overtime win against the Toronto Maple Leafs, when at the end of the second period McDavid skated over to an official and , animatedly: “No penalty? None? Every time!”,The Canadiens hadn’t played since March 20 because of the league’s coronavirus protocols, but they were fresh and dominated the Oilers. Kotkaniemi scored 18 seconds into the game. In the second period, McDavid had a goal disallowed after the Oilers were ruled offside. Montreal won, 4-0.,“I didn’t think anything of it; it was just a normal night.” McDavid said in response to a question from a Journal de Montréal reporter about having “an emotional night” that included the hit on Kotkaniemi and his disallowed goal.,Some were sympathetic to McDavid, and the plight of highly skilled generational stars like him whose talents can be routinely hampered by grabs, hits and illegal holds that go uncalled by the officials. Hockey has had , for years.,Still, some argued McDavid , or suggested that the N.H.L. department of player safety had sometimes failed to apply standards and discipline consistently. Many argued a less prominent player committing the same hit would have earned harsher in-game discipline and even a suspension.,McDavid is the , at $12.5 million a year, and perhaps its biggest star. Some people said they didn’t think the relatively small fine was enough punishment.,He was suspended in February 2019 for an illegal check to the head of Islanders defenseman Nick Leddy. In that instance, Leddy was attempting to play the puck and McDavid’s shoulder ,.,The department of player safety does not rule a player a repeat offender if 18 months have passed since his last infraction. McDavid’s latest hit falls well outside that window.",1
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/supreme-court-ncaa.html,sports,"WASHINGTON — Justices across the ideological spectrum teamed up during , on Wednesday to voice skepticism about the N.C.A.A.’s position that it could bar relatively modest payments to student-athletes in the name of amateurism despite the antitrust laws. But some of the same justices also seemed worried about opening the floodgates to further challenges.,Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said that “the antitrust laws should not be a cover for exploitation of the student-athletes,” adding that he doubted that college sports fans understood amateurism to require it.,“To pay no salaries to the workers who are making the schools billions of dollars on the theory that consumers want the schools to pay their workers nothing,” he said, seems “entirely circular and even somewhat disturbing.”,Justice Clarence Thomas noted that other participants in college sports are paid enormous sums. “It just strikes me as odd that the coaches’ salaries have ballooned,” he said, “and they’re in the amateur ranks, as are the players.”,By contrast, Justice Elena Kagan said, colleges and universities have used their combined market power “to fix athletic salaries at extremely low levels, far lower than what the market would set if it were allowed to operate.”,A ruling in favor of the education-related payments at issue in the case would be among the largest breakthroughs to date in the effort to pay college athletes, which has gained momentum in recent years as one state after another considers proposals to allow them to profit from their fame. It would also be yet another blow to the N.C.A.A., which has found its business model increasingly under siege and has argued that payments would effectively professionalize students.,Though there seemed to be something like a consensus for the payments at issue, several justices said they were concerned that such a ruling would prompt a deluge of other challenges.,“How do we know,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, “that we’re not just destroying the game as it exists?”,Justice Stephen G. Breyer added, “I worry a lot about judges getting into the business of deciding how amateur sports should be run.”,Last year, a , that the N.C.A.A. was not free to limit benefits tied to education for Division I football and basketball players. The decision allowed payments for things like musical instruments, scientific equipment, postgraduate scholarships, tutoring, study abroad, academic awards and internships. It did not permit the outright payment of salaries.,The court rejected the N.C.A.A.’s argument that compensating athletes would alienate sports fans who prize students’ amateur status. “Uncapping certain education-related benefits would preserve consumer demand for college athletics just as well as the challenged rules do,” Chief Judge Sidney R. Thomas wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco.,“Such benefits are easily distinguishable from professional salaries,” he wrote, as they are linked to education and could be provided in kind rather than in cash. “The record furnishes ample support,” Judge Thomas added, “that the provision of education-related benefits has not and will not repel college sports fans.”,At the argument on Wednesday, Seth P. Waxman, a lawyer for the N.C.A.A., said “these new allowances are akin to professional salaries.”,Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. responded that some of the payments the association already allows had a similar character.,“Schools can pay up to $50,000 for a $10 million insurance policy to protect student-athletes for future earnings,” he said. “Now that sounds very much like pay for play.”,Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., drawing on briefs supporting the players, painted a bleak picture of athletes’ lives and futures.,“They face training requirements that leave little time or energy for study, constant pressure to put sports above study, pressure to drop out of hard majors and hard classes, really shockingly low graduation rates,” he said. “Only a tiny percentage ever go on to make any money in professional sports.”,“So the argument is they are recruited, they’re used up, and then they’re cast aside without even a college degree,” he said. “How can this be defended in the name of amateurism?”,Mr. Waxman said the alternative would be worse. “If you allow them to be paid,” he said, “they will be spending even more time on their athletics and devoting even less attention to academics.”,Justice Alito said the athletes were already paid. “They get lower admission standards,” he said. “They get tuition, room and board, and other things. That’s a form of pay. So the distinction is not whether they’re going to be paid. It’s the form in which they’re going to be paid and how much they’re going to be paid.”,Mr. Waxman said paid internships posed particular hazards because they could involve unlimited sums.,Justice Sotomayor responded that the N.C.A.A. remained free to set limits. “If you think that internships should be related in some way to the educational experience,” she said, “you could pass rules to that effect.”,Justice Thomas said that paying athletes “sounds fine for the upper-level schools, whether it’s, you know, Alabama, Ohio State and Nebraska.” But he said he was worried that “the bigger schools would begin to cherry-pick with the transfer portal the athletes from the lower schools simply because they’re able to afford this income.”,Jeffrey L. Kessler, a lawyer for Shawne Alston, a former West Virginia University running back, and other student-athletes challenging the N.C.A.A.’s rules, said that “those schools don’t compete now.”,“Alabama pays its weight coaches $700,000 a year,” he said. “None of those small schools can do that.”,The Supreme Court last considered how antitrust laws applied to the association in 1984, ruling that its restrictions on television coverage of college football games were unlawful. But the decision, ,, included an influential passage on student-athletes.,“The N.C.A.A. plays a critical role in the maintenance of a revered tradition of amateurism in college sports,” , wrote for the majority. “There can be no question but that it needs ample latitude to play that role, or that the preservation of the student-athlete in higher education adds richness and diversity to intercollegiate athletics and is entirely consistent with the goals of” the antitrust laws.,The Biden administration filed a brief supporting the athletes in the new case, ,, No. 20-512, saying that the Ninth Circuit had struck the right balance.,“The court was focused on legitimate educational expenses,” Elizabeth B. Prelogar, the acting solicitor general, told the justices on Wednesday.,Besides the coronavirus pandemic, no issue has recently demanded more of the N.C.A.A.’s attention than the rights of student-athletes, especially whether they should be able to profit from their fame. College sports executives have long feared that loosening age-old rules would open a different array of challenges, but they have faced mounting pressure over the past few years from Congress and many of the nation’s statehouses.,Most crucially, a Florida law that directly challenges the N.C.A.A.’s policies is scheduled to take effect this summer, and California legislators are considering a proposal to speed up a similar measure there.,Although the N.C.A.A. has vowed to rewrite its rules, it delayed final approval over the winter after the Trump administration’s Justice Department raised misgivings. And Congress has not rushed to give the association the kind of political and legal cover it craves.,The argument on Wednesday had some lighter moments, as when Mr. Waxman mistakenly addressed Justice Thomas as “Mr. Chief Justice.”,“Thank you for the promotion,” Justice Thomas said.,The chief justice responded that the job was taken. “There’s no opening, Mr. Waxman,” he said.,Alan Blinder, contributed reporting.",5
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/magazine/damian-lillard-interview.html,sports," ,The scene is so familiar that it’s practically banal. Damian Lillard, the Portland Trailblazers’ All-Star guard, stands on a basketball court, covered in sweat and breathing heavily, fresh from scoring 50 points to lead the Blazers to a comeback win last month. From a TV studio far away, Dwyane Wade, an All-Star guard turned commentator, asks Lillard how he manages to make commercials, record music, raise three children and still drain 3-point shots from near half-court. This is where the script calls for Lillard to fall back on the usual jock clichés about thanking God and taking it one game at a time.,Instead, he moves in a different direction. “None of those things that you just named would be possible without the work,” Lillard says. “I wasn’t a highly touted middle school player, high school player or college player. I had to do my work behind the scenes.” He goes on to recall what it was like “to not have the lights on you and to want to be seen” and the methodical process involved in escaping that condition. Then, summoning the underdog spirit of Rocky Balboa and the Protestant ethic of Max Weber, he says: “I don’t forget those steps that it took for me to get here. So even though I got a family and I got all these commercials and these endorsements, I don’t forget the thing that makes all of those things possible. Which is the work, the discipline.”,I did not see Lillard’s peroration live on TV but a day later, on Twitter, where it played in heavy rotation, accompanied by sentiments like “class act” and “no better role model.” I am a basketball fan and have followed Lillard since his college days; the first time I came across the clip, I also happened to be waiting for my daughter to finish soccer practice. And yet despite being steeped in sports, both in my history and in that moment, they were the furthest thing from my mind as I watched. Lillard’s defense of discipline and hard work made me think about, of all things, politics.,Public performance and spectacle — rallies, speeches, news conferences — are as inherent to politics as they are to sports. Our two major political parties even hold their national conventions in giant sports arenas. And in politics, just as in sports, a tremendous amount of behind-the-scenes work is involved in making the spectacle possible. Before the senator’s dramatic floor speech, the bill must be drafted; the convention pageantry is typically preceded by the monthslong slog of drawing up a party platform. The public performance of politics is secondary to — and at the service of — the behind-the-scenes work, because the behind-the-scenes work is, in effect, the actual operation of government.,But in the last half decade, American politics has increasingly been dominated by its performative, under-the-lights aspects. Part of the appeal of Donald Trump’s 2016 candidacy was precisely that he wasn’t a career politician, that he , put in the work. Perhaps if he had been a different type of businessman, he and his staff might have been willing to grind behind the scenes once he reached the White House. Instead, governing took a back seat to performing. At the outset of the pandemic, for instance, Trump summoned reporters to the Rose Garden, where he crowed that Google had a vast team of engineers whipping up a website that Americans could use to sort out if and where they should be tested for the coronavirus. Google must have been surprised to hear this; the reality was that a subsidiary of its parent company was starting a testing program, beginning in the Bay Area, that would ultimately facilitate less than 1 percent of tests in the country last year. Even heavily promoted initiatives central to the MAGA agenda, like rolling back regulations on power plants or adding a citizenship question to the census, were so sloppily executed that courts ultimately overturned them on procedural grounds. ,This limelight-obsessed approach to politics extends far beyond Trump. Shortly after being sworn in in January, , obtained by Time magazine, boasting that he had “built my staff around comms rather than legislation.” In other words, his office planned to focus its energies not on lawmaking but on getting Cawthorn on TV to fire up the base. (This is not an irrational plan: Contemporary politics is so focused on the culture war that Cawthorn will most likely accrue more clout railing about Democrats’ trying to turn the country “into a Communist ash heap” than by sweating the details of legislation to, say, help small-business owners.) In February, as , that have been widely attributed to a failure to winterize its power systems, Gov. Greg Abbott appeared on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show to try to score political points by falsely blaming clean energy: “This shows how the Green New Deal would be a deadly deal for the United States of America,” he said, while some of his state’s residents were literally freezing to death.,During Joe Biden’s short time in office, he has been praised for focusing more on governing and less on entertaining. His aides advertise his diligence, catering to a post-Trump public desire for bureaucratic competence. “Joe Biden is the president — he’s not a pundit,” the press secretary, , noting that Biden would not be watching or opining on Trump’s second impeachment trial. Not staring at cable news all day and spouting off on Twitter, however, is an extremely low bar by which to measure a president. The “under-promise/over-deliver strategy” is “working well for President Biden so far,” as the CNN White House correspondent John Harwood wrote on Twitter — but perhaps the reason Biden can afford to under-promise in the first place is that Americans have come to expect so little.,We do, however, still expect a lot of our sports heroes. Over the last few years, Lillard has been among the many to wade into politics; last summer, he marched with Black Lives Matter protesters and released a song, as Dame D.O.L.L.A., about the police killings of George Floyd and others. Efforts like these have been met with criticism from right-wing commentators like Laura Ingraham, who once admonished politically active athletes to “shut up and dribble.” But athletes like Lillard recognize that it is their ability to dribble — their diligent mastering of the fundamentals of their sports — that allows them to have political impact. As he told Dwyane Wade, “I know that’s a part of why I’ve been able to get a lot of the things that I’ve gotten.” This is an approach that politicians might do well to emulate. For too many, there are no fundamentals, only showboating. Maybe it’s time someone told them to shut up and govern.,Jason Zengerle is a writer at large for the magazine.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/sports/ncaabasketball/march-madness-final-four-gonzaga.html,sports,"INDIANAPOLIS — The warm, fuzzy story line of this N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament is Gonzaga’s pursuit of an undefeated season. The Zags, tucked away on the dry, desolate side of the Cascade Range, have long since grown out of their glass slippers — they travel by charter, produce a pipeline of N.B.A. talent and have won more N.C.A.A. tournament games than anyone in the country since 2015.,Still, the spotlight doesn’t always find its way to the boys from Spokane.,Even on the cusp of a landmark run, the Zags found themselves on the undercard Tuesday night, relegated to the opening act for a pair of blue bloods, U.C.L.A. and Michigan.,No matter, Gonzaga quickly carved up what had been a flaming-hot Southern California team, 85-66, to win the West regional final at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Zags (30-0) will advance to play 11th-seeded U.C.L.A., which stunned top-seeded Michigan, 51-49, to become the second team to reach the Final Four while coming out of the First Four as one of the last at-large selections in the 68-team field.,The Bruins got 28 points from Johnny Juzang, and held Michigan without a basket for the final 5 minutes, 22 seconds, including a 3-pointer by Franz Wagner that bounced off the rim at the buzzer.,As it did, the Bruins poured off the bench and onto the floor, celebrating a wild finish to an untidy game that put them in the Final Four for the first time in 13 years and kept alive a chase for a 12th national title.,Standing in the way is the team that supplanted the Bruins, with their rich but long ago history, as the best in the West.,For all of Gonzaga’s success since it burst onto the college basketball scene with a run to the round of 8 in 1999, this is just the second time it has reached the Final Four. The Zags lost in the title game to North Carolina in 2017. They were agonizingly close in 2015 and 2019, losing in a regional final. And another opportunity was lost to the pandemic last season, which the Zags concluded with a 31-2 record and a No. 2 ranking in the final Associated Press Top 25 poll.,Much as Gonzaga Coach Mark Few has tried to keep his players on assignments and responsibilities that come with each game plan — something they have largely adhered to — freshman Jalen Suggs admitted that with two games left, his team has eyes on the possibility of an undefeated season, which has not been accomplished since Indiana in 1976.,“It’s hard not to think about it,” Suggs said. “We try to keep our minds off of it and keep focused on the task at hand.”,On this night, though, it all came so easily — just as it has throughout the tournament.,Gonzaga, which has had one game closer than double digits all season, has cruised past Norfolk State, Oklahoma, Creighton and U.S.C. with no game closer than 16 points.,The Zags were so unencumbered on Tuesday that Drew Timme, the mustachioed, headband-wearing sophomore center from Dallas, seemed to go through his entire catalog of flexes after scoring — showing off a bicep, twirling his finger or shaking his head after tossing in a jump hook over Evan Mobley, suggesting that the Trojans’ lithe 7-foot freshman could not guard him.,For one night, he was not wrong. Mobley is likely to be one of the first players picked in the 2021 N.B.A. draft but he had little success trying to thwart Timme, who plays with patience and a surfeit of post moves.,Timme set the tone for the thumping just moments into the game, when he stripped U.S.C. point guard Tahj Eaddy of the ball at one end and drew a foul from Mobley at the other after pump faking him into the air. He scored 13 of Gonzaga’s first 23 points. In all, Timme finished with 23 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists and 3 steals.,“It set the tone that, hey, we’re going to be aggressive,” Few said of Timme’s steal. “This thing’s going to start with defense.”,The only moment the Zags’ momentum was slowed was a sobering one. Referee Bert Smith collapsed in front of the Gonzaga bench after he had run down the court. He pivoted in the corner and then keeled over, his head hitting the floor with a thud.,Paramedics rushed to attend to Smith, who remained breathing while lying on his back. As Few huddled his players to the side of the court, guard Joel Ayayi and assistant coach Tommy Lloyd peeked over to check on Smith, who was eventually carried off on a stretcher. He was alert and stable and was not taken to a hospital, an N.C.A.A. spokesman said. He was replaced by an alternate referee.,When play resumed — with the score 11-4 in favor of Gonzaga — so did the beat down.,The game had seemed to promise some intrigue: pitting the most proficient scoring team inside the 3-point arc against the team most adept at defending within it.,U.S.C. is one of the tallest teams in the country with the Mobley brothers, Evan and Isaiah, standing 7-foot and 6-foot-10 being flanked by 6-foot-8 Drew Peterson and 6-foot-7 Isaiah White. The Trojans’ zone defense all but forms a picket fence around the basket. But for all their height, the Trojans do not handle the basketball particularly well and Gonzaga repeatedly doubled Evan Mobley and stripped other Trojans of the ball.,Those steals, six in the first half, sent the Zags off and running, leaving U.S.C. Coach Andy Enfield fuming at his players and then the referees, wondering what became of the team that had routed Drake, Kansas and Oregon on its way to a regional final for the first time in 20 years. Gonzaga led 49-30 at halftime.,The second half was spent largely running out the clock, which expired just as fans on the West Coast were sitting down to eat dinner.,The schedule is made largely by the networks that broadcast the games, CBS and TBS. Tuesday’s games were broadcast on the cable network. TBS spokesman Jay Moskowitz declined to explain why the Zags were put in the early game, which began when much of the country — including the entire West Coast — was still at work.,Both games featured a team from the Los Angeles market, but the networks often prefer to put U.C.L.A. in prime slots — as they have in all five games the Bruins have played. And with a No. 1 seed like Michigan, which has a national following, it may have been a predictable decision.,Not that it bothered Few. He said, simply and seemingly without irony, that Gonzaga fans had their priorities in order.,“Trust me, our fans, they’re not at work,” he said. “If you think they’re at work, you don’t know the Zag fans. Everything’s shut down, and everybody was watching.”",2

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/climate/ocean-blue-economy-business.html,business,"Marty Odlin, who grew up and lives on the Maine coast, remembers what the ocean used to be like. But now, he said, “It’s like a desert and just within my lifetime.” In the last few years, he said, he has seen lots of sea grass and many other species virtually disappear from the shoreline.,Mr. Odlin, 39, comes from a fishing family and has a passion for the history of the ocean and the coast, both of which have informed his sense of the ocean’s decline, a small part of the catastrophic deletion of marine life over the last several hundred years.,Using his training as an engineer, Mr. Odlin has decided to try to reverse that decline with his company, ,, which is based in Portland. Using a combination of robotics, sensors and machine learning, he is building an aquaculture operation that is selling oysters now and eventually clams. He is also using that system to grow kelp, with the goal of producing enough of this seaweed to pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and permanently sequester it by burying it on the ocean floor, and sell carbon offsets.,The company also plans to seed oyster reefs and clam beds along the shoreline, and restore kelp forests and sea grass, to help the coastal ecosystem by bringing back biodiversity and improving water quality, among other benefits.,Mr. Odlin’s plans are one of a number of efforts in the “blue economy,” a term used to describe commercial activity on the oceans, seas and coasts. He and others are trying to prove that ocean conservation, sustainable fishing and carbon sequestration can be good for business, especially as global shipping, aquaculture and the appetite for wild seafood increases around the world.,Mr. Odlin and his team build everything: boats, oyster floats, sensors and more, all with very high sensitivity to their environment. They measure the amount of feed in the water and the growth rate of the various species and send that information into a database that they use to make all sorts of decisions: whether to change the feed, reposition the shellfish floats or make bigger changes about the varieties they’re growing. They also use the hard-won knowledge of commercial fishermen — there are about a dozen on staff — which Mr. Odlin said was a huge advantage.,The climate crisis demands technological innovations and “hard hats and steel toes,” he said.,Dan Watson, the chief executive and co-founder of ,, also has recognized the benefits of working alongside industry and demonstrating profitability.,His company builds high-tech fishing nets for trawling boats: Attached to the nets are LED lights that flash in various patterns and levels of brightness to signal emergency escape hatches (right-size holes) for those species that fishing boats aren’t trying to catch, known collectively as bycatch., that LED lights can , the amount of unwanted species that end up in fishing nets.,, about 9.1 million tons, or just over 10 percent of all of the fish caught every year, are thrown away, with nearly half coming from trawling nets.,In an era of overfishing and , that defy international regulations, reducing the amount of fish or other marine animals that are caught by mistake could have important consequences for the health of various populations as well as ocean biodiversity as a whole, Mr. Watson said.,“When I started all of this, I was a student, and I had the attitude of, ‘This is going to save the world and everyone should do it,’” Mr. Watson said.,“I had to turn more towards, ‘Here is the value proposition, and there is a strong financial argument for catching the right fish,’” he added. “We can show crews, ‘Here is what you save on fuel, here is what you save on regulatory fines.’”,Others, too, see the value of working with industry groups. , is an initiative from the University of California Santa Barbara to help big ships avoid hitting whales as they travel through ports around Los Angeles. The program came, in part, as a response to shipping companies asking for help, according to Douglas McCauley, a professor of ocean science at U.C.S.B.,Ship strikes, as they are known, are among the leading causes of death for whales, and 2018 and 2019 were the worst years on record for collisions on the West Coast, with 27 total resulting in 22 deaths, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Scientists estimate that the actual number of whales killed by ships could be much higher — ,— because not all of the bodies are discovered.,Dr. McCauley helped bring together ocean technologists working at U.C.S.B. to build a near real-time detection system for whales in the Santa Barbara Channel, ,: an artificial intelligence algorithm that analyzes whale sounds, classifies them by species, and sends the data for review; a remote sensing system that predictively forecasts whale presence; and plain old citizen science, where trained whale watchers log whales into a mobile app.,“It’s not helpful if you’re only able to say, ‘Southern California is forecast to be cloudy with a chance of blue whales,” and this model forecasts at a much finer scale, Dr. McCauley said.,The system delivers the information to ships in a simplified rubric of low, medium, high and very high, so that they can slow if whales are around, which can ,. Whale Safe provides data about only this particular stretch of the California coast, but Dr. McCauley said they were planning to expand to San Francisco and possibly elsewhere in North America.,When ships reduce their speed they use less fuel, resulting in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants; the global shipping industry accounts for ,.,Cargo ships typically burn dirty fuel that releases pollutants like nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide, which can cause various cancers and childhood asthma for people living in port cities. ,.,In only six months, slower speeds in the Santa Barbara and San Francisco areas , from nitrous oxide by more than 530 tons and greenhouse gas emissions by 17,000 metric tons.,But saving the whales could also have huge climate benefits, Dr. McCauley said.,During their lives and when they die, whales help sequester enormous amounts of carbon dioxide in two ways. When alive, whales supply phytoplankton (which suck up carbon dioxide) with the nutrients they need to grow. When whales die, their bodies sink to the bottom of the ocean and over time become part of the marine sediment layer, where they can sequester the carbon dioxide they have accumulated during their life span, an average of , for a great whale species, keeping it out of the atmosphere for hundreds or thousands of years.,Any of these projects require a more hands-on approach to saving the ocean and a more deliberate overlap of business and conservation, which have historically been at odds, said Mr. Odlin, the founder of Running Tide.,“We have to take a more active role in solving the problem that we’re seeing,” he said. “And how do you take a more active role? The moral imperative is that you have to build something at the scale of the problem.”,Otherwise, he said, “generations in front of us are not going to forgive us.”,“We still have a chance right now, so I’m working as hard as I can.”",0
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/business/grocery-retail-mask-mandates.html,business,"Marilyn Reece, the lead bakery clerk at a Kroger in Batesville, Miss., started noticing more customers walking around the store without masks this month after the state mandate to wear face coverings was repealed. Kroger still requires them, but that doesn’t seem to matter.,When Ms. Reece, a 56-year-old breast-cancer survivor, sees those shoppers, she prays. “Please, please, don’t let me have to wait on them, because in my heart, I don’t want to ignore them, I don’t want to refuse them,” she said. “But then I’m thinking I don’t want to get sick and die, either. It’s not that people are bad, but you don’t know who they’ve come into contact with.”,Ms. Reece’s heightened anxiety is shared by retail and fast-food workers in states like Mississippi and Texas, where governments have removed , before a majority of people have been vaccinated and while troubling new variants of the coronavirus are appearing. It feels like a return to the early days of the pandemic, when businesses said customers must wear masks but there was no legal requirement and numerous shoppers simply refused. Many workers say that their stores do not enforce the requirement, and that if they do approach customers, they risk verbal or physical altercations.,“It’s given a great false sense of security, and it’s no different now than it was a year ago,” said Ms. Reece, who is not yet able to receive a vaccine because of allergies. “The only difference we have now is people are getting vaccinated but enough people haven’t gotten vaccinated that they should have lifted the mandate.”,For many people who work in retail, especially grocery stores and big-box chains, the mask repeals are another example of how little protection and appreciation they have received during the pandemic. While they were praised as essential workers, that rarely , on top of their low wages. Grocery employees were not initially given priority for vaccinations in ,, even as health experts cautioned the public to limit time in grocery stores because of the risk posed by new coronavirus variants. (Texas opened availability to everyone 16 and older on Monday.),The issue has gained serious prominence: On Monday, President Biden called on governors and mayors to , as the nation grapples with a potential rise in virus cases.,The United Food and Commercial Workers union, which represents nearly 900,000 grocery workers, said this month that at least 34,700 grocery workers around the country had been infected with or exposed to Covid-19 and that at least 155 workers had died from the virus. The recent mass shooting at a ,, has only rattled workers further and added to concerns about their own safety.,Diane Cambre, a 50-year-old floor supervisor at a Kroger in Midlothian, Texas, said she had spent much of the past year worrying about bringing the virus home to her 9-year-old son and dreading interactions with customers who were flippant about the possibility of getting sick. She wears a double mask in the store even though it irritates her skin, already itchy from psoriasis, and changes her clothes as soon as she gets home.,After Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said on March 2 that he would , the next week, Ms. Cambre said, customers immediately “started coming in not wearing a mask and stuff, and it’s been pretty hard getting anybody to wear one.” Management is supposed to offer masks to people who aren’t wearing them, but if they don’t put them on, nothing else is done, she said.,Asking customers to wear masks can result in tense exchanges and even ,.,“Some of our customers are drama-prone, so they’ll start yelling, ‘I’m not wearing that mask,’ and you can tell they’re very rude in their voice and very harsh,” Ms. Cambre, a U.F.C.W. member, said. Overseeing the self-checkout aisles has been especially challenging, she said, because customers who need help will demand that she come over, making it impossible to maintain six feet of distance.,At times when she has tried to explain the need for distancing, “they say, ‘OK, and that’s just a government thing,’” she said. “It really takes a toll on you mentally.”,A Kroger representative said that the chain would “continue to require everyone in our stores across the country to wear masks until all our frontline grocery associates can receive the Covid-19 vaccine,” and that it was offering $100 one-time payments to workers who received the vaccine.,The differing state and business mandates have some workers worried about more ,. The retail industry was already trying to address the issue last fall, when a major trade group helped put together training to help workers manage and de-escalate conflicts with customers who resisted masks, social distancing and store capacity limits. ,, or asking them to leave, has led to incidents in the past year like a cashier’s being punched in the face, a Target employee’s breaking his arm and the fatal shooting of a ,.,This month in League City, Texas, near Houston, a 53-year-old man who , a required mask in a , confronted employees and then stabbed a store manager three times, according to a report in The Houston Chronicle. On March 14, a San Antonio ramen shop , with racist graffiti after its owner criticized Mr. Abbott on television for lifting the Texas mask mandate.,On March 17, a 65-year-old woman was arrested in an , after she refused to wear a mask or leave the store, just days after an arrest warrant was issued for her in Galveston, Texas, for behaving similarly in a , location.,MaryAnn Kaylor, the owner of two antique stores in Dallas, including Lula B’s Design District, said the mask mandate repeal mattered a lot for stores and people’s behavior. ,“He should have focused more on getting people vaccinated instead of trying to open everything up,” she said of Governor Abbott, noting that Texas has one of the country’s slowest vaccination rates. ,“You still have cases every day in Texas, and you have people dying still from Covid,” she said. “This complete lifting of mandates is stupid. It shouldn’t have been based on politics — it should have been based on science.”,Some Texans have started to seek out mask-friendly establishments. Ms. Kaylor said that lists of Dallas businesses that require masks had been circulating on Facebook, and that people were consulting them to figure out where to buy groceries and do other shopping.,Emily Francois, a sales associate at a Walmart in Port Arthur, Texas, said that customers had been ignoring signs to wear masks and that Walmart had not been enforcing the policy. So Ms. Francois stands six feet away from shoppers who don’t wear masks, even though that upsets some of them. “My life is more important,” she said.,“I see customers coming in without a mask and they’re coughing, sneezing, they’re not covering their mouths,” said Ms. Francois, who has worked at Walmart for 14 years and is a member of United for Respect, an advocacy group. “Customers coming in the store without masks make us feel like we aren’t worthy, we aren’t safe.”,Phillip Keene, a spokesman for Walmart, said that “our policy of requiring associates and customers to wear masks in our stores has helped protect them during the pandemic, and we’re not lifting those measures at this time.”,Even before the pandemic, Ms. Reece, the Kroger clerk in Mississippi, was wearing a mask to protect herself from the flu because of her cancer diagnosis, she said.,She said 99 percent of customers in her small store had worn masks during the pandemic. “When they had to put it on, they did put it on,” she said. “It’s like giving a child a piece of candy — that child is going to eat that candy unless you take it from them.”,She is concerned about the potential harm from new variants, particularly from those who don’t cover their mouths. “You just have to pray and pray you don’t get within six feet of them, or 10 feet for that matter,” said Ms. Reece, who is also a U.F.C.W. member and has worked for Kroger for more than 30 years. “I know people want it to be back to normal, but you can’t just will it to be back to normal.”",5
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/business/office-return-space.html,business,"Since the pandemic sent workers home last year, a slew of modifications have been made to office buildings to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. Now, as companies prepare to bring workers back, experts say even more changes are on the way.,Expect expanded gathering spaces and fewer personal workstations, for instance, changes that are being fueled by the success of working from home. Companies like ,, , and , have already announced proposals for hybrid work models that will allow employees to continue to work remotely at least a few days a week.,These new arrangements mean companies may need less office space, and some have already cut back on their real estate needs, according to ,. , said this month that it was giving up office space in downtown Minneapolis, and in September, the sporting goods retailer , in Bellevue, Wash.,“We really are at an inflection point,” said Meena Krenek, an interior design director at Perkins+Will, an architecture firm that is revamping offices, including its own, for new modes of working.,Last spring, while lockdowns were in place, landlords and tenants prepared for what they thought would be ,. Desks were dragged six feet apart and Plexiglas ,. One-way arrows were stenciled on corridor floors, chairs were removed from conference rooms, and an elaborate choreography was developed to determine how and when teams would return to avoid overcrowding.,Then many workers simply stayed home. As the pandemic dragged on and people got the hang of Zoom, many discovered it was possible to be productive while parked on living room sofas or in backyard lawn chairs.,Now, as company heads , to the office, not only safety measures but also the new work arrangements are driving discussions about the postpandemic workplace. More than 80 percent of companies are embracing a hybrid model whereby ,, according to a new survey by KayoCloud, a real estate technology platform.,Workplaces are being reimagined for activities benefiting from face-to-face interaction, including collaboration on projects and employee training, as a way to promote a company’s culture and identity.,Common areas will be increased and equipped with furniture that can be moved as needs change. Steelcase and Knoll, suppliers of office furniture, report strong interest in mobile tables, carts and partitions.,But as the amount of space devoted to gathering expands, the fate of one’s own personal turf at the office — a desk decorated with family photos, a couple of file cabinets — hangs in the balance. Why, company leaders are asking, should someone who is in the office one or two days a week require a space that will sit empty the rest of the time?,In some cases, personal desks are being replaced with “hoteling” workstations, also called hot desks, which can be used by whoever needs a place to touch down for a day.,In the early months of the pandemic, when it was believed that the coronavirus was spread via contaminated surfaces, hot desks got a hard no from office users. But that stance has softened with the recognition that the virus is transmitted mainly through the air. Protocols for wiping down tabletops before and after use have become the norm. So has reserving a hot desk ahead of time rather than simply showing up and grabbing a free spot.,Workers have often resisted the loss of their personal desks when companies sought to reduce their real estate footprint, but they may be more amenable to the idea now if the payoff is the ability to skip the commute and work from home.,“A year ago, if I had interviewed people, they would have said they definitely need three file cabinets and a bookshelf,” said Andrea Vanecko, a principal at the architecture firm NBBJ. “Now there’s a very different answer.”,Conference rooms, too, are getting a reboot. In the past, these rooms were predicated on the idea of people gathering in person. A large screen on a wall might be used for presentations or to let an executive in another location make a cameo appearance.,But some employees are permanently moving to remote work, and companies are puzzling over how to give them the same ability to participate as those who are physically present. There are even early discussions about using artificial intelligence to conjure up , of employees who are off site but could still ,.,For now, some companies are having in-person attendees continue to use their laptops so that remote workers can see everyone on their Zoom screens, an effort to “help maintain a sense of equivalency that we’ve come to expect,” said Peter Knutson, chief strategy officer of A+I, a design firm.,Devices combining 360-degree cameras, microphones and speakers are being placed on a table or tripod to improve sound and visibility. In the future, these technologies are likely to be built into gathering places and the number of screens increased, transforming the conference room into a “Zoom room,” Ms. Krenek said.,Likewise, some phone booths — the closet-size pods deployed in open-plan offices to give workers a place to make private calls — may give way to videoconferencing booths, which ,.,Screens are destined to pop up elsewhere. One near the coffee bar or at a cafe table could allow those on the premises to meet virtually for a latte or lunch with colleagues working remotely.,And digital whiteboards are likely to become more popular, so workers at home can see what’s being written in real time.,Modifications made to offices to protect against the coronavirus are still in effect. Stopgap measures may fade away as the pandemic loosens its grip, but others will be here to stay.,In lobbies, floor decals spaced six feet apart may be around “just until people get into the habit,” said Natalie Engels, a principal at Gensler, an architecture firm. Signs that had proliferated during the pandemic — promoting “self-cleaning” elevator buttons and virus-zapping technologies like ionization and ultraviolet light — will eventually be removed.,But increasingly, moving through an office building is likely to be a hands-free experience aided by mobile apps, sensors and voice controls, even after the reluctance to touch surfaces diminishes.,Sensors will allow employees to enter a turnstile and summon an elevator with the wave of a hand. Landlords who have yet to invest in such systems have experimented with ,. Buttons on walls outside restrooms can be pressed with an elbow, averting the need to touch door handles. Some companies are adding ,.,The coronavirus has focused attention on air quality in what may be a lasting way. , before the pandemic and have become more so as fresh air has gone from being a nicety to being a necessity.,Landlords have in some cases adjusted HVAC systems to increase the amount of outdoor air being pumped in. They are also upgrading filters to trap smaller airborne particles.,Some measures are being enshrined in leases, said Geoffrey F. Fay, a real estate lawyer with Pullman & Comley. But landlords are doing such things proactively, he added, as they try to make offices as enticing as possible at a time when tenants may be wondering if they even need to rent space anymore.,“Landlords realize we are on the precipice of change,” he said. “They want to make employees feel comfortable to the extent they’re coming back to the office.”",0
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/06/technology/cyber-hackers-usa.html,business,"If ever there was a sign the United States was losing control of information warfare, of its own warriors, it was the moment one of its own, a young American contractor, saw first lady Michelle Obama’s emails pop up on his screen.,For months, David Evenden, a former National Security Agency analyst, questioned what he was doing in Abu Dhabi. He, like two dozen other N.S.A. analysts and contractors, had been lured to the United Arab Emirates by a boutique Beltway contractor with offers to double, even quadruple, their salaries and promises of a tax-free lifestyle in the Gulf’s luxury playground. The work would be the same as it had been at the agency, they were told, just on behalf of a close ally. It was all a natural extension of America’s War on Terror.,Mr. Evenden started tracking terror cells in the Gulf. This was 2014, ISIS had just laid siege to Mosul and Tikrit and Mr. Evenden tracked its members as they switched out burner phones and messaging apps.,The images they traded back and forth could be brutal, but this was his calling, Mr. Evenden told himself. A theology major, he’d set out to be a chaplain. He was a long way from that, but what better way to prove your faith, he thought, than hunting those who sought to murder good Christians. Soon, though, he was assigned to a new project: proving the Emiratis’ neighbor, Qatar, was funding the Muslim Brotherhood. The only way to do that, Mr. Evenden told his bosses, would be to hack Qatar.,“Go for it,” they told him. No matter that Qatar was also an American ally or that, once inside its networks, his bosses showed no interest in ever getting out.,Before long his team at the contractor, CyberPoint, was hacking Emirati enemies, real and perceived, all over the world: Soccer officials at FIFA, the monarchy’s Twitter critics, and especially Qatari royals. They wanted to know where they were flying, who they were meeting, what they were saying. This too was part of the mission, Mr. Evenden was told; it had all been cleared up high. In the War on Terror and the cyber arms market, you could rationalize just about anything.,All the rationalizations were stripped away the day emails from the first lady of the United States popped up on his screen. In late 2015, Michelle Obama’s team was putting the finishing touches on a trip to the Middle East. Qatar’s Sheikha Moza bint Nasser had invited Mrs. Obama to speak at her annual education summit in Doha, where the first lady would promote her “Let Girls Learn” initiative.,Mrs. Obama and her team were in constant communication with Sheika Moza. And every last email between the first lady, her royal highness, and their staff — every personal reflection, reservation, itinerary change and security detail — was beaming back to former N.S.A. analysts’ computers in Abu Dhabi. “That was the moment I said, ‘We shouldn’t be doing this,’ he told me. “We should not be targeting these people.”,Mr. Evenden and his family were soon on a flight home. He and the few colleagues who joined him tipped off the F.B.I. (The agency does not comment on investigations, but interviews suggest its review of CyberPoint is ongoing.) To pre-empt any fallout, some employees , clean to Reuters. The hack of Sheika Moza’s emails with Mrs. Obama has never been reported.,It wasn’t long after Mr. Evenden settled back in the states that he started fielding calls and LinkedIn messages from his old buddies at the N.S.A., still in the service, who had gotten a “really cool job offer” from Abu Dhabi and wanted his advice. By 2020, the calls had become a drumbeat. “Don’t go,” he pleaded. “This is not the work you think you will be doing.”,You might think you’re a patriot now, he wanted to warn them, but one day soon you too could wake up and find you’re just another mercenary in a cyber arms race gone horribly wrong.,Three decades ago, the United States spawned, then cornered, the market for hackers, their tradecraft, and their tools. But over the past decade, its lead has been slipping, and those same hacks have come boomeranging back on us.,Yet no one in government has seriously paused to recalibrate the strategy. Not with Michelle Obama’s emails caught in an American contractor’s dragnet in 2015. And not today, with Russian hackers inside our government networks. We went from occasional wake-up calls to one continuous, blaring alarm — and got better and better at ignoring it all.,Months after Mr. Evenden returned home, in 2016, the N.S.A.’s own hacking tools were hacked, by a still unknown assailant. Those tools were picked up first by North Korea, then Russia, in the most destructive cyberattack in history. ,Over the next three years, Iran emerged from a digital backwater into one of the most prolific cyber armies in the world. China, after a brief pause, is back to pillaging America’s intellectual property. And, we are now unwinding a Russian attack on our software supply chain that compromised the State Department, the Justice Department, the Treasury, the Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Energy and its nuclear labs and the Department of Homeland Security, the very agency charged with keeping Americans safe.,We know this not because of some heroic N.S.A. hack, or intelligence feat, but because the government was tipped off by a security company, FireEye, after it discovered the same Russian hackers in its own systems.,The hubris of American exceptionalism — a myth of global superiority laid bare in America’s pandemic death toll — is what got us here. We thought we could outsmart our enemies. More hacking, more offense, not better defense, was our answer to an increasingly virtual world order, even as we made ourselves more vulnerable, hooking up water treatment facilities, railways, thermostats and insulin pumps to the web, at a rate of 127 new devices per second.,At the N.S.A., whose dual mission is gathering intelligence around the world and defending American secrets, offense eclipsed defense long ago. For every hundred cyberwarriors working offense — searching and stockpiling holes in technology to exploit for espionage or battlefield preparations — there was often only one lonely analyst playing defense to close them shut.,America remains the world’s most advanced cyber superpower, but the hard truth, the one intelligence officials do not want to discuss, is that it is also its most targeted and vulnerable. Few things in the cybersecurity industry have a worse reputation than alarmism. There is even an acronym for it: “FUD,” short for “fear, uncertainty, and doubt.”,When Leon Panetta, then secretary of defense, warned of a coming “Cyber Pearl Harbor” in 2012, he was dismissed as stoking FUD. The Cyber Pearl Harbor analogy is, indeed, flawed: The U.S. government did not see the Japanese bombers coming, whereas it has seen the digital equivalent coming for decades.,And the potential for a calamitous attack — a deadly explosion at a chemical plant set in motion by vulnerable software, for example — is a distraction from the predicament we are already in. Everything worth taking has already been intercepted: Our personal data, intellectual property, voter rolls, medical records, even our own cyberweaponry.,At this very moment, we are getting hacked from so many sides that it has become virtually impossible to keep track, let alone inform the average American reader who is trying to grasp a largely invisible threat that lives in code, written in language that most of us will never fully understand.,This threat often feels too distant to combat, but the solutions have been there for decades: Individuals just decided that access and convenience, and in governments’ case, the opportunities for espionage, were worth leaving windows open, when we would have all been better off slamming them shut.,“The N.S.A.’s fatal flaw is that it came to believe it was smarter than everyone else,” Peter Neumann, ,, told me. “In the race to exploit everything and anything we could, we painted ourselves into a dead end where there is no way out.”,There’s a reason we believed the fallacy that offense could keep us safe: The offense was a bloody masterpiece.,Starting in 2007, the United States, with Israel, pulled off an attack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility that destroyed roughly a fifth of Iran’s centrifuges. That attack, known as Stuxnet, spread using seven holes, known as “zero days,” in Microsoft and Siemens industrial software. (Only one had been previously disclosed, but never patched). Short term, Stuxnet was a resounding success. It set Iran’s nuclear ambitions back years and kept the Israelis from bombing Natanz and triggering World War III. In the long term, it showed allies and adversaries what they were missing and changed the digital world order.,In the decade that followed, an arms race was born.,N.S.A. analysts left the agency to start cyber arms factories, like Vulnerability Research Labs, in Virginia, which sold click-and-shoot tools to American agencies and our closest Five Eyes English-speaking allies. One contractor, Immunity Inc., founded by a former N.S.A. analyst, embarked on a slippier slope. First, employees say, Immunity trained consultants like Booz Allen, then defense contractor Raytheon, then the Dutch and the Norwegian governments. But soon the Turkish army came knocking.,Companies like CyberPoint took it further, stationing themselves overseas, sharing the tools and tradecraft the U.A.E. would eventually turn on its own people. In Europe, purveyors of the Pentagon’s spyware, like Hacking Team, started trading those same tools to Russia, then Sudan, which used them to ruthless effect.,As the market expanded outside the N.S.A.’s direct control, the agency’s focus stayed on offense. The N.S.A. knew the same vulnerabilities it was finding and exploiting elsewhere would, one day, blow back on Americans. Its answer to this dilemma was to boil American exceptionalism down to an acronym — NOBUS — which stands for “Nobody But Us.” If the agency found a vulnerability it believed only it could exploit, it hoarded it.,This strategy was part of what Gen. Paul Nakasone, the current N.S.A. director — and George Washington and the Chinese strategist Sun Tzu before him — call “active defense.”,In modern warfare, “active defense” amounts to hacking enemy networks. It’s mutually assured destruction for the digital age: We hacked into Russia’s troll networks and its grid as a show of force; Iran’s nuclear facilities, to take out its centrifuges; and Huawei’s source code, to penetrate its customers in Iran, Syria and North Korea, for espionage and to set up an early warning system for the N.S.A., in theory, to head off attacks before they hit.,When we discovered openings in the systems that govern the digital universe, we didn’t automatically turn them over to manufacturers for patching. We kept them vulnerable in the event the F.B.I. needed to access a terrorist’s iPhone or Cyber Command had reason to drop a cyberweapon on Iran’s grid one day.,There were big payoffs, to be sure, many the public will never know, but all one needs to do is look at the attacks of the past five years to see that “active defense” and NOBUS aren’t working that well.,In a leaked N.S.A. memo in 2012, an analyst warned as much, “Hacking routers has been good business for us and our Five Eyes partners for some time, but it is becoming apparent that other nation states are honing their skillz and joining the scene.”,Only when the N.S.A.’s tools were hacked in 2017, then used against us, could we see how broken the trade-off between offense and defense had become. The agency had held onto a critical vulnerability in Microsoft for more than five years, turning it over to Microsoft only after the N.S.A. was hacked.,By then it was too late. Businesses, schools and hospitals had yet to patch the hole when North Korea used it to attack one month later, or even two months later, when Russia baked it into a cyberattack that decimated vaccine supplies at Merck, cost FedEx $400 million and prevented doctors from accessing patient records. All in, that incident costs victims an estimated $10 billion in damages.,In the wake of those strikes, in 2017, Gen. Michael Hayden, the former director of the N.S.A., and one of its most vocal supporters, was unusually speechless. “I cannot defend an agency having powerful tools if it cannot protect the tools and keep them in its own hands,” ,.,To understand how we got here, facing one escalating attack after another, and how we might possibly claw our way out, it’s useful to look back at the Russian attack that put us on this offensive course.,That year, 1983, workers at the American embassy in Moscow came to believe that everything they said and did was being captured by the Soviets. They suspected a mole, and had it not been for a tip from the French, who discovered a bug in their teleprinters, they might have never discovered the mole was in their machines.,In 1984, President Ronald Reagan personally approved a classified project, code-named Gunman, to find and eradicate any Soviet bugs in embassy equipment. It took 100 days just to get every last piece of equipment back to Fort Meade and nearly 100 more days to uncover the most sophisticated exploit the agency had ever seen.,Sitting in the back of an embassy typewriter was a tiny magnetometer, a device that measured the slightest disturbance in the earth’s magnetic field. It had been recording the mechanical energy from every last typewritten stroke and transmitting the results via radio to a nearby Soviet listening unit, hidden in the embassy’s chimney. By the time Gunman was complete, and more implants were discovered, it was clear that the Soviets had been siphoning American secrets from our typewriters for eight years.,“That was our big wake up call,” James R. Gosler, the godfather of American cyberwar, told me. “Or we’d still be using those damn typewriters.”,If any single technologist can be credited with spurring the United States to scramble, catch up, and take the lead as the world’s most advanced digital superpower, it is Mr. Gosler. When I asked nearly every one of the men who guided the N.S.A. and C.I.A. through the turn of the century to name the father of American cyber offense. None hesitated: “Jim Gosler.”,In Mr. Gosler’s lexicon, there’s BG — Before Gunman — and AG. BG, “Americans were fundamentally clueless,” he told me. “We were in la-la land.”,AG, we were hacking into anything with a digital pulse.,Over his long career at Sandia national labs, the N.S.A., and later the C.I.A., Mr. Gosler made it his personal mission to draw the government’s attention to vulnerabilities in the microchips, code and software seeping into our lives.,He does not discuss any of the classified programs he was privy to, but under his tenure, he helped create a taxonomy of adversaries that could exploit these vulnerabilities and led teams of American analysts and spies to make sure the United States was on top.,But every calorie the United States expended on offense came at the cost of defense. And over the decades, this trade-off gnawed at Mr. Gosler. Finding Gunman in those typewriters had been a feat. Finding its equivalent in our fighter jets or even the average high-end car, which now has more than 100 million lines of code? Good luck.,This, essentially, is the predicament the United States now faces as it hunts down every last vector and backdoor used in the recent SolarWinds attack, so dubbed because Russians used SolarWinds, a Texas company that sells network software to government agencies, grid operators and more than 400 of the Fortune 500, as a conduit.,Occasionally we respond to attacks with indictments, sanctions or cyberattacks of our own. President Biden added $10 billion in cybersecurity funds to his Covid-19 recovery proposal and said Thursday that the United States was “launching an urgent initiative” on cybersecurity, to improve America’s “readiness and resilience in cyberspace.”,But finding every Russian back door could take months, years even. And climbing out of our current mess will entail a grueling choice to stop leaving ourselves vulnerable.,For individuals, this means making life less convenient. It’s not ignoring password prompts and software updates, turning on two-factor authentication, not clicking malicious links. For businesses, it requires testing code as engineers write it, not after it has made its way into consumer hands. It requires adding moats around the crown jewels: using hand-marked paper ballots, removing the controls that govern our nuclear plants, medical equipment and air traffic from anything else.,For the government, perhaps, an easy place to start is setting clear rules that prevent the N.S.A.’s own, like Mr. Evenden’s former employer, from doing the dirty work for other governments where the rules that govern our own spycraft do not apply. And it’s long past time to shut all the doors and windows that should never have been left open.,Jim Gosler worked for decades to keep Americans, and our secrets, safe, to make sure we never had to know just how close to a catastrophic cyberattack we could come. Now, as the country reckons with scenarios he long feared, he realizes the way forward is understanding just how unsafe we already are.,Gunman didn’t impact the average American where they would feel it, but SolarWinds is getting pretty darn close,” Mr. Gosler told me recently. “It’s so pervasive. It’s one step from SolarWinds into the electrical grid. If the average American can’t feel that? What is it going to take?”,Nicole Perlroth, a cybersecurity reporter at The Times, is the author of the forthcoming book “,,” from which this article is adapted.",0
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/business/economy/unequal-economic-recovery.html,business,"Robin Arnone, a part-time trainer before the coronavirus pandemic, hasn’t set foot in the Colosseum Gym in Columbia, Md., since the virus shut it down almost a year ago. The gym is open again, but she doesn’t need the work. Things are going gangbusters in her other job as a home appraiser, and she hasn’t looked back.,For Julie Stark, one of Ms. Arnone’s best friends and a professional dog walker, things are not so rosy. With many clients stuck at home in the pandemic and taking care of their own pets, her services are no longer in demand. Instead of walking seven dogs each day, she now walks three.,Ms. Stark has had to economize, eliminating dance and gymnastics classes for her children to save $350 a month. She doesn’t know when her clients will want her back, but it’s not something she discusses with Ms. Arnone. “We don’t talk about money,” Ms. Stark said.,“It would be awkward if she were a dog walker and doing unbelievably well,” she added. “I’m happy for her.”,And there is a lot in Ms. Arnone’s life to be happy about. She replaced her used Lexus with a new one last year, and in December she indulged herself with a $550 Dyson hair dryer. “It felt a little ridiculous,” she said of the purchase. “But I worked hard, and if there’s any year I’m going to do it, it’s this year.”,Robin Arnone and Julie Stark are among the millions of friends who were on a relatively equal financial footing before last March — people who would have thought nothing of splitting the check on a night out — and now find themselves on vastly different trajectories. Lockdowns changed what Americans can do as well as what services they need, and in the process created divergent fates for many workers.,The pandemic has wreaked havoc on many who were already struggling. Nearly 10 million fewer people have jobs, and some 26 million reported not always having enough to eat, according to Census Bureau data.,For the 50 percent or so of the population that make up the middle class — defined by Pew Research Center as having an income ranging from around $45,000 to $135,000 for a household of three — the toll has been uneven. Like a tornado, the pandemic can devastate one household and leave neighboring ones unscathed.,Ms. Arnone’s world, in the Washington-Baltimore area, exemplifies that. The gym where she worked, the Colosseum, is owned by her friend Tim Gallagher. His monthly income at the gym is down 25 to 30 percent, and a quarter of the gym’s members have suspended their accounts. To save money, he has lowered the thermostat at home to 60 degrees from 65, and while his truck has more than 340,000 miles on it, he has no plans to replace it.,“You just got to scrape along and gut it out,” he said. “We’re really struggling to get by.”,But in Ms. Arnone’s other field, home appraising, her friends and colleagues are reaping rewards from the booming housing market, where ,, according to the National Association of Realtors. Ultralow mortgage rates have prompted a wave of refinancings, which require fresh appraisals.,“I don’t have much to complain about,” said Traci Warner, a friend of Ms. Arnone’s and a home appraiser in Waldorf, Md., south of Washington. After her husband was laid off from his sales job in April, Ms. Warner’s work picked up the slack.,It’s not that things are perfect, but unlike Mr. Gallagher, she does not feel that she is barely hanging on.,This contrast is mirrored in the larger economy. Weekly unemployment claims by newly laid-off workers remain at historically elevated levels even as stock indexes reach record highs.,Vaccines have arrived, but their slow rollout means it will be months before anything resembling normal activity can resume at restaurants, hotels, gyms, airports, malls and other businesses that depend on bringing people together.,“It’s very uneven,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, a forecasting and research group. “The recovery for the most vulnerable parts of the population will take years.” Not only are wages and salaries down for the hardest-hit segments of the work force, he noted, but so are overall employment and participation in the labor force.,At the very top, the gains have been staggering. In eight months after the pandemic hit the United States, ,, according to a November study by the Institute for Policy Studies and other progressive groups. That included a $70 billion lift for just one of those magnates: the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.,White-collar employees, having emerged mostly unscathed from the sharp downturn in 2020, are looking forward to what they hope will be a robust recovery in 2021 once most people are vaccinated. Service workers, devastated by the idling of entire industries amid lockdowns and other restrictions, just want the pain to abate.,The split was evident in the ,. While professional and business services employment jumped by 97,000 in January, that job growth was almost entirely offset in the private sector by losses in retail, leisure and hospitality industries, among others.,So while lines at food banks lengthen, new Teslas dot parking lots, and there are waiting lists for Peloton machines so the most fortunate can keep up with their workouts from home.,Peter Atwater, a lecturer in economics at the College of William & Mary, has popularized a term for this phenomenon: the K-shaped recovery. While one arm of the K ascends, the other is driving lower. “There’s an enormous divide in confidence,” he said. “And we buy and spend based on how we feel.”,Janet L. Yellen, the newly confirmed Treasury secretary, extended the metaphor during her confirmation hearings. “We are living in a K-shaped economy, one where wealth built upon wealth, while working families fell farther and farther behind,” she said.,Ms. Arnone misses her days at the gym, especially spending time with clients. It is the first time since she was 15 that she hasn’t worked as a trainer, she said. But she is feeling pretty good otherwise.,Before the pandemic, she would train people in the morning and shift to her real estate work in the afternoon. Now she rises at 6 a.m. to start writing up appraisals before hitting the road to visit as many as eight homes in a day.,“I’ve declined a boatload of appraisal jobs,” she said. “I just didn’t have the time.”,After typically handling 500 appraisals a year, she did 635 last year. She is paid by the banks that issue the mortgages, and last year she estimates she earned roughly $250,000 for her services, up from about $185,000 in previous years.,She lives in Woodbine, Md., 25 miles west of Baltimore, and though she still thinks of herself as middle class, she says her nieces tell her she is upper middle class and concedes that they’re probably right.,It’s a world away from the apartment where she grew up in Randallstown, Md., a Baltimore suburb, as the child of a single mother. “Thinking back, I had no clue,” Ms. Arnone said. “I didn’t realize how much we didn’t have. If I wanted something, my mom would go without, but I didn’t have the nicest clothes or the name brands.”,Maybe that’s why she feels a little ashamed of her good fortune when she sees news stories about long lines at food banks or other evidence of the pandemic’s economic woes. “When I throw out the veggies I never got to eat, my mother’s Catholic guilt weighs one me,” she said.,Home appraisal is a boom-and-bust business, driven by the housing market’s cycles. But with interest rates near record lows, and new buyers shopping for houses while existing homeowners refinance, work is plentiful for now.,Ms. Warner — Ms. Arnone’s friend and fellow home appraiser — traded in her Honda Accord, which had more than 300,000 miles on it, for a 2017 BMW X3, not long ago, and was able to go to the beach in Delaware with her family last summer. This month, they went skiing in Virginia.,“Our finances are pretty good,” added Ms. Warner, 51. “The market has been amazing.”,Ms. Arnone, by her own description, is a worrywart, and had done her training work on the side to supplement her income. Now she doesn’t feel the need.,“The gym was always my safe place, and it’s weird not seeing Tim and other friends — I miss them,” she said. “But I won’t lie. It’s nice to have more time and more flexibility.”,A year ago, Julie Stark felt things were going her way. Five years earlier, she started a business as a dog walker and pet sitter, after having been a veterinary technician. “It was perfect,” she said, until the pandemic arrived.,Now her clients are home and can walk their dogs themselves. And the decline in travel leaves little need for pet sitters. “I’m holding out hope that my clients will need me again,” she said. She has been surviving with help from her parents, child support from her ex-husband, and unemployment benefits.,Ms. Stark has her hands full with her own pets in the meantime. She has two rescue dogs, Roxy and Luke, as well as two cats. Everyone, she adds, gets along.,She did get one new client during the pandemic, but most of the so-called pandemic puppies adopted in the last 11 months are being walked by their owners or their children, she said. She isn’t sure whether her old clients will come back when the pandemic recedes or she will be walking the new dogs.,Sometimes she thinks of returning to a 9-to-5 job outside the house. “Part of me just wants a stable job and a regular paycheck,” she said. It doesn’t seem realistic, though: With her two daughters, aged 10 and 14, in school remotely, she needs to be at home most of the time. “I’m just hoping things will return to normal,” she said.,Government aid has been crucial for helping people like Ms. Stark and Mr. Gallagher weather the pandemic. And their reliance on it underscores why many economists believe more federal assistance is necessary, especially if the K-shaped recovery continues.,“Political leaders and policymakers have a big role to play in getting that bottom leg of the K up,” Mr. Daco of Oxford Economics said. “They hold the key to a stronger labor-market recovery that is as inclusive as possible and will reduce the long-term damage to the economy.”,Mr. Gallagher, the owner of the Colosseum Gym, recently applied for a second round of small-business loans. That, and forbearance from his landlord, should enable him to keep Colosseum open in the months ahead.,Still, he is not expecting an imminent recovery. “I think it’s going to take till the end of the year,” he said. “We’re allowed to operate at 50 percent of capacity. But I don’t have to worry about 50 percent because everybody is scared to death to come in.”,The warnings from Maryland’s governor, Larry Hogan, haven’t helped business, Mr. Gallagher added. “His Covid briefings are deadly to my gym,” he joked. “Every time he opens his mouth, another five or six people put their memberships on hold.”,In the meantime, Mr. Gallagher’s decisions reflect the continuing economic pain. He has laid off most of his part-time employees.,Normally, he and his wife would go out several times a week, but now one outing is the limit. “That’s a big splurge for us,” he said. They have also dropped premium channels from their cable service.,At the gym, a popular gathering spot for hard-core weight lifters, the clanging of the machines has been replaced by background music and the whirring of the treadmills occupied by the most devoted exercisers.,And public health officials have warned that ,, potentially threatening Colosseum’s revival.,Mr. Gallagher said there is little personal training going on. Maybe five or six guests are out on the floor, while Mr. Gallagher keeps himself busy cleaning up and fixing equipment. Every so often, he signs up a new member, with dues running at $59 a month.,He is confident that eventually — on the other side of the pandemic — people will want to come back to the gym.,Not everyone, though. He is concerned that members who have fallen out of the gym habit may never return. “It’s going to take longer to make up for those memberships and get other people to join,” he said. “A few people will never want to go to the gym, or the movies or where there are crowds of people. It’s a shame.”",0

Others are expensive, custom-built software packages, armed with more sophisticated types of artificial intelligence, that are capable of doing the kinds of cognitive work that once required teams of highly-paid humans.,White-collar workers, armed with college degrees and specialized training, once felt relatively safe from automation. But recent advances in A.I. and machine learning have created algorithms capable of outperforming ,, , and ,at certain parts of their jobs. And as bots learn to do higher-value tasks, they are climbing the corporate ladder.,The trend — , for years, but accelerating to warp speed since the pandemic — goes by the sleepy moniker “robotic process automation.” And it is transforming workplaces at a pace that few outsiders appreciate. Nearly 8 in 10 corporate executives , last year said they had implemented some form of R.P.A. Another 16 percent said they planned to do so within three years.,Most of this automation is being done by companies you’ve probably never heard of. UiPath, the largest stand-alone automation firm, is valued at $35 billion — roughly the size of eBay — and is , later this year. Other companies like Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism, which have Fortune 500 companies like Coca-Cola and Walgreens Boots Alliance as clients, are also enjoying breakneck growth, and tech giants like Microsoft have , their own automation products to get in on the action.,Executives generally spin these bots as being good for everyone, “streamlining operations” while “liberating workers” from mundane and repetitive tasks. But they are also liberating plenty of people from their jobs. Independent experts say that major corporate R.P.A. initiatives have been followed by rounds of layoffs, and that cutting costs, not improving workplace conditions, is usually the driving factor behind the decision to automate. ,Craig Le Clair, an analyst with Forrester Research who studies the corporate automation market, said that for executives, much of the appeal of R.P.A. bots is that they are cheap, easy to use and compatible with their existing back-end systems. He said that companies often rely on them to juice short-term profits, rather than embarking on more expensive tech upgrades that might take years to pay for themselves.,“It’s not a moonshot project like a lot of A.I., so companies are doing it like crazy,” Mr. Le Clair said. “With R.P.A., you can build a bot that costs $10,000 a year and take out two to four humans.”,Covid-19 has , to deal with growing demand, closed offices, or budget constraints. But for other companies, the pandemic has provided cover for executives to implement ambitious automation plans they dreamed up long ago.,“Automation is more politically acceptable now,” said Raul Vega, the chief executive of Auxis, a firm that helps companies automate their operations.,Before the pandemic, Mr. Vega said, some executives turned down offers to automate their call centers, or shrink their finance departments, because they worried about scaring their remaining workers or provoking a backlash like the one that followed the outsourcing boom of the 1990s, when C.E.O.s became villains for sending jobs to Bangalore and Shenzhen.,But those concerns matter less now, with millions of people already out of work and many businesses struggling to stay afloat.,Now, Mr. Vega said, “they don’t really care, they’re just going to do what’s right for their business.”,Sales of automation software are expected to rise by 20 percent this year, after increasing by 12 percent last year, according to the research firm Gartner. And the consulting firm McKinsey, which predicted before the pandemic that 37 million U.S. workers would be displaced by automation by 2030, recently , to 45 million.,Not all bots are the job-destroying kind. Holly Uhl, a technology manager at State Auto Insurance Companies, said that her firm has used automation to do 173,000 hours’ worth of work in areas like underwriting and human resources without laying anyone off.,“People are concerned that there’s a possibility of losing their jobs, or not having anything to do,” she said. “But once we have a bot in the area, and people see how automation is applied, they’re truly thrilled that they don’t have to do that work anymore.”,As bots become capable of complex decision-making, rather than doing single repetitive tasks, their disruptive potential is growing., by researchers at Stanford University and the Brookings Institution compared the text of job listings with the wording of A.I.-related patents, looking for phrases like “make prediction” and “generate recommendation” that appeared in both. They found that the groups with the highest exposure to A.I. were better-paid, better-educated workers in technical and supervisory roles, with men, white and Asian-American workers, and midcareer professionals being some of the most endangered. Workers with bachelor’s or graduate degrees were nearly four times as exposed to A.I. risk as those with just a high school degree, the researchers found, and residents of high-tech cities like Seattle and Salt Lake City were more vulnerable than workers in smaller, more rural communities.,“A lot of professional work combines some element of routine information processing with an element of judgment and discretion,” said David Autor, an economist at M.I.T. who studies the labor effects of automation. “That’s where software has always fallen short. But with A.I., that type of work is much more in the kill path.”,Many of those vulnerable workers don’t see this coming, in part because the effects of white-collar automation are often couched in jargon and euphemism. On their websites, R.P.A. firms promote glowing testimonials from their customers, often glossing over the parts that involve actual humans.,“Sprint Automates 50 Business Processes In Just Six Months.” ,“Dai-ichi Life Insurance Saves 132,000 Hours Annually” ,“600% Productivity Gain for Credit Reporting Giant with R.P.A.”,Jason Kingdon, the chief executive of the R.P.A. firm Blue Prism, speaks in the softened vernacular of displacement too. He refers to his company’s bots as “digital workers,” and he explained that the economic shock of the pandemic had “massively raised awareness” among executives about the variety of work that no longer requires human involvement.,“We think any business process can be automated,” he said.,Mr. Kingdon tells business leaders that between half and two-thirds of all the tasks currently being done at their companies can be done by machines. Ultimately, he sees a future in which humans will collaborate side-by-side with teams of digital employees, with plenty of work for everyone, although he conceded that the robots have certain natural advantages.,“A digital worker,” he said, “can be scaled in a vastly more flexible way.”,Humans have feared losing our jobs to machines for millennia. (In 350 BCE, Aristotle worried that self-playing harps would make musicians obsolete.) And yet, automation has never created mass unemployment, in part because technology has always generated new jobs to replace the ones it destroyed.,During the 19th and 20th centuries, some lamplighters and blacksmiths became obsolete, but more people were able to make a living as electricians and car dealers. And today’s A.I. optimists argue that while new technology may displace some workers, it will spur economic growth and create better, more fulfilling jobs, just as it has in the past.,But that is no guarantee, and there is growing evidence that this time may be different.,In a series of recent studies, Daron Acemoglu of M.I.T. and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University, two well-respected economists who have researched the history of automation, , that for most of the 20th century, the optimistic take on automation prevailed — on average, in industries that implemented automation, new tasks were created faster than old ones were destroyed.,Since the late 1980s, they found, the equation had flipped — tasks have been disappearing to automation faster than new ones are appearing.,This shift may be related to the popularity of what they call “so-so automation” — technology that is just barely good enough to replace human workers, but not good enough to create new jobs or make companies significantly more productive.,A common example of so-so automation is the grocery store self-checkout machine. These machines don’t cause customers to buy more groceries, or help them shop significantly faster — they simply allow store owners to staff slightly fewer employees on a shift. This simple, substitutive kind of automation, Mr. Acemoglu and Mr. Restrepo wrote, threatens not just individual workers, but the economy as a whole.,“The real danger for labor,” they wrote, “may come not from highly productive but from ‘so-so’ automation technologies that are just productive enough to be adopted and cause displacement.”,Only the most devoted Luddites would argue against automating any job, no matter how menial or dangerous. But not all automation is created equal, and much of the automation being done in white-collar workplaces today is the kind that may not help workers over the long run.,During past eras of technological change, governments and labor unions have stepped in to fight for automation-prone workers, or support them while they trained for new jobs. But this time, there is less in the way of help. Congress has , to fund federal worker retraining programs for years, and while some of the money in the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill Democrats hope to pass this week will go to laid-off and furloughed workers, none of it is specifically earmarked for job training programs that could help displaced workers get back on their feet.,Another key difference is that in the past, automation arrived gradually, factory machine by factory machine. But today’s white-collar automation is so sudden — and often, so deliberately obscured by management — that few workers have time to prepare.,“The rate of progression of this technology is faster than any previous automation,” said Mr. Le Clair, the Forrester analyst, who thinks we are closer to the beginning than the end of the corporate A.I. boom.,“We haven’t hit the exponential point of this stuff yet,” he added. “And when we do, it’s going to be dramatic.”,The corporate world’s automation fever isn’t purely about getting rid of workers. Executives have shareholders and boards to satisfy, and competitors to keep up with. And some automation does, in fact, lift all boats, making workers’ jobs better and more interesting while allowing companies to do more with less.,But as A.I. enters the corporate world, it is forcing workers at all levels to adapt, and focus on developing the kinds of distinctly human skills that machines can’t easily replicate.,Ellen Wengert, a former data processor at an Australian insurance firm, learned this lesson four years ago, when she arrived at work one day to find a bot-builder sitting in her seat.,The man, coincidentally an old classmate of hers, worked for a consulting firm that specialized in R.P.A. He explained that he’d been hired to automate her job, which mostly involved moving customer data from one database to another. He then asked her to, essentially, train her own replacement — teaching him how to do the steps involved in her job so that he, in turn, could program a bot to do the same thing.,Ms. Wengert wasn’t exactly surprised. She’d known that her job was straightforward and repetitive, making it low-hanging fruit for automation. But she was annoyed that her managers seemed so eager to hand it over to a machine.,“They were desperate to create this sense of excitement around automation,” she said. “Most of my colleagues got on board with that pretty readily, but I found it really jarring, to be feigning excitement about us all potentially losing our jobs.”,For Ms. Wengert, 27, the experience was a wake-up call. She had a college degree and was early in her career. But some of her colleagues had been happily doing the same job for years, and she worried that they would fall through the cracks.,“Even though these aren’t glamorous jobs, there are a lot of people doing them,” she said.,She left the insurance company after her contract ended. And she now works as a second-grade teacher — a job she says she sought out, in part, because it seemed harder to automate.,Kevin Roose, a technology columnist at The Times, is the author of the new book , from which this essay is adapted.",0
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/13/business/nursing-homes-ratings-medicare-covid.html,business,"Twelve years ago, the U.S. government introduced a powerful new tool to help people make a wrenching decision: which nursing home to choose for loved ones at their most vulnerable. Using a simple star rating — one being the worst, five the best — the system promised to distill reams of information and transform an emotional process into one based on objective, government-blessed metrics.,The star system quickly became ubiquitous, a popular way for consumers to educate themselves and for nursing homes to attract new customers. During the coronavirus pandemic, with many locked-down homes unavailable for prospective residents or their families to see firsthand, the ratings seemed indispensable.,But a New York Times investigation, based on the most comprehensive analysis of the data that powers the ratings program, found that it is broken.,Despite ,, the system provided a badly distorted picture of the quality of care at the nation’s nursing homes. Many relied on sleight-of-hand maneuvers to improve their ratings and hide shortcomings that contributed to the damage when the pandemic struck.,More than , nursing-home residents have died of Covid-19, and The Times’s analysis found that people at five-star facilities were roughly as likely to die of the disease as those at one-star homes.,The ratings program, run by the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, relies on a mix of self-reported data from more than 15,000 nursing homes and on-site examinations by state health inspectors. Nursing homes receive scores based on how they fare in those inspections; how much time nurses spend with residents; and the quality of care that residents receive. Those three grades are then combined into an overarching star rating for each nursing home.,To evaluate the ratings’ reliability, The Times built a database to analyze millions of payroll records to determine how much hands-on care nursing homes provide residents, combed through 373,000 reports by state inspectors and examined financial statements submitted to the government by more than 10,000 nursing homes.,The Times obtained access to portions of the ratings data that aren’t publicly available from academics who had research agreements with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or C.M.S.,Among The Times’s findings:,At homes whose five stars masked serious problems, residents developed bed sores so severe that their bones were exposed. Others lost the ability to move.,But the most important impact may be that the nursing home industry was ill equipped for the pandemic. The rating system allowed facilities to score high grades without upgrading the care they provided.,“They were working to improve their ratings, but not their quality,” said Charlene Harrington, who sits on a board that advises C.M.S. on the ratings system.,“The problems with the five-star system left these homes less prepared in the pandemic,” she said. “They were allowed to not have enough staffing, and they were allowed to ignore infection-control deficiencies, so they had poorer quality than the public knew about, and they were in the worst position to manage Covid.”,Fulton Commons Care, a nursing home on Long Island, is among hundreds of facilities whose five stars reflected self-reported data that was at times inaccurate.,One of the home’s residents was Stasia Kochanowska, a 75-year-old retired nurse. Last March, her son, John Costa, got a phone call from Fulton Commons: She was being moved from a private room into one with other residents. Mr. Costa interpreted that as evidence that the home was short-staffed or overcrowded. “I thought that the idea was to isolate people to keep them safe from the virus,” he said.,Not long after, he got another call: Ms. Kochanowska had a fever. On the morning of April 10, Mr. Costa got the news he had been dreading: His mother had died from Covid-19.,“Looking back now, I realize that the star doesn’t work and shouldn’t be trusted,” Mr. Costa said. “But it’s too late.”,The star system was introduced in 2008. , were buying many nursing homes, and lawmakers worried that the quality of care would deteriorate. (Today, for-profit companies own about 70 percent of all U.S. nursing homes.),The only way to evaluate nursing homes at the time was , called Nursing Home Compare. It included tables of statistics about each nursing home. Consumers largely ignored the information.,The new system transformed hard-to-digest information on resident safety, staffing and dozens of other metrics into simple star ratings.,The rating starts with the grade from the in-person inspections and then awards bonus points for facilities that score well on the other two ratings: for staffing and their quality of care. The staffing score reflects the number of hours that employees spend with patients. The quality-of-care rating incorporates 15 metrics — such as residents’ wounds and medications — drawn from what are essentially medical report cards for every resident.,C.M.S. posts each nursing home’s overall star rating, and its ratings for inspections, staffing and quality of care, on a website called ,When the system was first rolled out, elder-care groups applauded it for providing an easy-to-understand look inside nursing homes. As it gained popularity, it became a powerful determinant of fortunes in an industry with thin profit margins.,Five-star facilities earned about $2,000 in profits per bed in 2019, according to a Times analysis of nursing homes’ financial statements. Those with three or four stars earned about $1,000 per bed. Poorly rated homes were typically not profitable.,But within months of the star system’s launch, members of a Medicare advisory board cautioned federal officials that nursing homes were incentivized to fudge their numbers, according to board members and former regulators. Board members, including Ms. Harrington, a professor emeritus at the nursing school of University of California, San Francisco, called for more auditing of the self-reported data.,Audits, however, remain rare, according to 25 former government officials, congressional aides, nursing home executives and elder-care advocates who meet regularly with C.M.S. officials.,The Times found that from 2017 to 2019 health inspectors wrote up about 5,700 nursing homes, more than one out of every three in the country, for misreporting data about residents’ well-being. That included nearly 800 homes with top ratings. Some facilities didn’t tell the government about certain medications they were giving residents. Others didn’t disclose when residents took serious falls or developed bed sores.,Even when inspectors discovered such misreporting, they didn’t conduct more detailed audits of all of the data that the homes submitted to C.M.S.,A spokeswoman for C.M.S. said in a statement that the star-rating system is “intended to serve as one tool” for people to choose nursing homes. “Overall scores should be considered in light of a potential resident’s unique care needs,” she said. (C.M.S. would not identify the spokeswoman.),C.M.S. in recent years “has made multiple substantial improvements to both the ratings methodology and data reliability of the five-star quality rating system. These improvements have made it more difficult to attain or maintain higher ratings, driving providers to continue improving the quality of care they provide,” the spokeswoman said.,She said the Department of Health and Human Services “takes reports of fraud seriously” and that “C.M.S. deploys enforcement and accountability measures swiftly if fraud is detected.”,The warnings about self-reported data have been borne out by researchers.,A , last year by Integra Med Analytics, a data firm started by a University of Texas professor, compared hospital admissions data with the information nursing homes submitted to Medicare. The paper concluded that half of nursing homes underreported potentially deadly pressure ulcers, or bed sores, by at least 50 percent.,In 2019, the , found that nursing homes reported only 16 percent of incidents where residents were hospitalized for “potential abuse and neglect.”,And researchers at the University of Chicago ,, from 2011 to 2015, nursing homes didn’t tell Medicare about 40 percent of residents who were hospitalized after serious falls.,One of the worst offenders in that study was the Clove Lakes home on Staten Island in New York, where 72 residents were admitted to a hospital after falling, but only 15 were reported to C.M.S. A Clove Lakes spokeswoman declined to comment.,Menorah Park, a facility in Beachwood, Ohio, that had five stars, disclosed only 11 of 47 serious falls.,Kathleen DeVito, a former resident at Menorah Park, said in an interview that she selected the facility based on its perfect rating. One night, she said, aides took her to the bathroom and then left her alone. She crashed to the floor while trying to wipe herself. Her ankle was shattered, her medical records show. She now has to use a walker.,“I think about how much better I’d be if I had never gone there,” said Ms. DeVito, 78, a retired paralegal.,Beth Silver, a spokeswoman for the nursing home, said, “The incidence of falls at Menorah Park is in line with other highly regarded facilities at both the state and federal levels, and are even lower for serious falls, which we attribute to our rigorous fall prevention program.”,She added, “While our sympathy goes out to anyone who may have been injured while a resident at our facility, it does not necessarily mean that the facility was at fault or could have prevented the injury.”,In 2018, C.M.S. improved the way it collected staffing data. Instead of asking nursing homes to report the average number of hours nurses and aides spent with residents, the agency required homes to submit payroll records that logged their daily hours. The hope was that such data would be harder to manipulate.,With the payroll records, nursing homes’ average staffing numbers plummeted, according to the Times analysis. That suggested that homes had previously been inflating their nursing data.,Even with the new system, many homes still appear to exaggerate how much time nurses spend with patients.,The Times analyzed the publicly available staffing logs submitted to C.M.S. Thousands of homes — including more than 450 with four or five stars for staffing — derived at least half of their nursing hours from administrators who don’t care for patients. C.M.S. permits the practice, but the public sees only the total number of hours, not the breakdown between administrative nurses and registered nurses who care for patients.,Sun Terrace Healthcare Center had a two-star rating for staffing in early 2019. Then, in the second half of the year, the home, in Sun City Center, Fla., reported a surge in its nursing hours. The bulk of that increase was from the addition of administrators to the tally. By January 2020, Sun Terrace had a five-star rating.,“The administrative nursing staff at Sun Terrace work very closely with the direct care staff in a collaborative team approach to ensure the facility provides the best possible care for each and every resident,” said Alexander J. Kusmierz, the facility’s executive director.,In light of questions from The Times, Mr. Kusmierz said, the home would audit the staffing data it has reported to C.M.S. “Sun Terrace will continue to make certain that the information provided is thorough and accurate,” he said.,Researchers have , that the better staffed a facility was, the fewer residents they lost to Covid-19. More employees meant that patients received better care and were more closely monitored. When the pandemic hit, staffing came under additional strain as nurses and workers fell ill.,Trinity Homes, a facility with 230 beds in Minot, N.D., received five stars for its staffing levels. But residents repeatedly complained to inspectors that the place was short-staffed. In 2019, half of Trinity’s nursing hours came from administrators.,More than 130 residents contracted Covid-19. Thirty-five died.,Karim Tripodina, a spokeswoman for Trinity, said the home complies with C.M.S. requirements and has “ample staff to care for our residents.” She said that Covid-19 spread inside the facility at the same time it was spreading in the local community, “despite aggressive efforts to maintain a safe environment.”,Carrie Johnson, 75, had just had spinal fusion surgery. A raw incision snaked up her back, and it needed to be cleaned regularly to prevent infection. She couldn’t control her bowels.,Using the C.M.S. website, Ms. Johnson found a nursing home, Brookdale Richmond Place, where she could recuperate. Part of the country’s largest chain of senior living communities, it was a short drive from her house in Lexington, Ky., and the only local facility with a five-star rating for staffing.,“We thought it meant that I’d be safe,” Ms. Johnson said.,That was not what it meant.,At the time, in October 2017, Brookdale was operating with a skeleton crew, according to six current and former employees and court documents filed in a lawsuit brought by Ms. Johnson. Overwhelmed employees at the 120-bed facility would wake some residents as early as 3:30 a.m. to get them dressed for breakfast and then would put the residents back into bed to wait the hours until mealtime, the lawsuit alleged.,More than a week passed before Ms. Johnson was first given a shower, her medical records show. Her surgical wound was not treated. No one came when she rang her call bell for help going to the toilet, so she sat for hours in her own urine and feces. At one point, Ms. Johnson said, a passing maintenance man changed her diaper.,On at least three days in her first month there, no one brought her pain medication. Some days there were no nurses on the floor tending to patients, according to the current and former employees and depositions in the pending lawsuit. Nurses spent an average of less than 30 minutes a day per patient.,Brookdale, however, told Medicare that each resident received an average of 75 minutes of daily care. The home arrived at that number by including nurses who were stationed at Brookdale’s corporate headquarters in Tennessee, some 200 miles away, according to depositions and the employees.,Absent the inflated staffing numbers, Brookdale’s rating would most likely have fallen to one or two stars.,Jessica Crutchfield, a nursing assistant who worked at the Brookdale home while Ms. Johnson was there, said in a deposition last year that her supervisors told her to falsify residents’ medical records to make it look like they received more care than they did. When she refused, she was fired, she said.,Heather Hunter, a spokeswoman for Brookdale, said, “We have detailed policies in place to ensure compliance with C.M.S. reporting rules, and we are not aware of any instance where inaccurate or false information was submitted by any of our communities outside of the confines of the C.M.S. rules.”,Ms. Johnson’s incision began to fester. In November 2017, a physical therapist noticed that it “appeared open and presented with discoloration around incisions.” She alerted the nursing staff, records show, but it took six days before anyone treated the wound.,When Ms. Johnson went to an outside doctor, her wound was infected, medical records show. The doctor sent her to the hospital. The infection left her unable to move. Her muscles atrophied.,Ms. Hunter didn’t comment on what happened to Ms. Johnson. “While The New York Times has the right to print unproven allegations from one side of a lawsuit seeking monetary damages, we choose not to litigate unsubstantiated facts in the press,” she said.,Ms. Johnson now lives at home. She used to manage the kitchen at a local homeless shelter; now she can’t walk or even stand. She said she spends about six hours a day in front of the television, waiting for her husband to get back from work. She misses cooking sloppy joes for her six grandchildren.,“I wouldn’t send my dog there,” Ms. Johnson said of Brookdale. “That five-star rating is garbage.”,Medicare began tracking nursing homes’ use of certain prescription drugs after the Health and Human Services inspector general , that facilities were overusing antipsychotic drugs, which can be especially dangerous for older people. The ratings system now penalizes homes that overmedicate residents.,According to court documents and interviews with nurses, administrators and government officials, nursing homes for years have underreported the number of residents on opiates and antipsychotics.,On Dec. 12, 2017, Eunice Hill checked into National Healthcare Corporation’s nursing home in Greenville, S.C., for what was supposed to be a short-term rehab stay after a nasty fall made it hard for her to walk. (National Healthcare, a publicly traded company, operates 75 facilities around the United States.) Ms. Hill’s daughter, Anne Brown, said she and her mother drew comfort from the facility’s five-star rating.,That first day at the nursing home, staff gave Ms. Hill Haldol, a powerful antipsychotic, her medical records show. She was also given anti-anxiety medications every day for a week.,That is not what National Healthcare told the government. At least four times a year, nursing homes are required to provide C.M.S. “minimum data sets” for each patient, the equivalent of medical report cards that detail things like weight, medications and wounds. In Ms. Hill’s data set, National Healthcare said that she did not receive any antipsychotics and only got anti-anxiety drugs once.,A National Healthcare spokeswoman declined to comment, citing a pending lawsuit that Ms. Hill’s daughter filed against the company.,Ms. Hill, 93 and suffering from diabetes, started skipping meals, causing her blood sugar levels to go wild, according to her medical records. In late December, she was rushed to a hospital. Doctors found her kidneys were failing and that she was severely dehydrated.,She died on Jan. 3, less than a month after she arrived at the National Healthcare home.,At the Good Samaritan home in Albert Lea, Minn., a resident’s foot became infested with , in 2018 after her bandages were left on for days. At Dwelling Place in Dover, N.J., staff didn’t change residents’ , for more than a month last year, increasing the risk of infection.,In both cases, government health inspectors determined that the nursing homes failed to keep their residents safe. Yet both earned five stars.,The C.M.S. rating system puts the greatest weight on in-person inspections; they are the starting point for the final star rating.,But the exams do little to penalize homes with serious problems. At nearly 1,200 homes with five stars, inspectors over a three-year period identified at least one problem involving potential patient abuse, such as violence committed by staff or the failure to investigate injuries, The Times found.,In 2019, health inspectors , a nursing assistant at the Reo Vista home in San Diego had followed a resident who uses a wheelchair to her room from the kitchen, where she was getting a late-night sandwich. The employee pushed her on the bed and raped her, according to the inspection report.,The report classified the attack as a “category F” violation, a low-level problem that caused potential, not actual, harm.,That designation helped Reo Vista hold onto its perfect rating, which it trumpets on its website.,“This former staff member’s actions do not reflect the values we hold at our facility that our overall five-star rating more accurately reflects,” said William Fredricksen, Reo Vista’s administrator. He said the home was using background checks and other means “to ensure that something like this never again occurs at our facility.”,At 40 other five-star nursing homes, inspectors similarly determined that sexual abuse did not constitute actual harm or put residents in “immediate jeopardy,” The Times found.,After a complaint in 2019, for example, inspectors , that a nursing assistant at Hickory Creek in Madison, Ind., had barged into the bathroom while a resident was showering and groped her breasts. Hickory Creek kept its five stars.,Hickory Creek officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.,At Manor Care in Boca Raton, Fla., John Schulz, a 57-year-old resident with Alzheimer’s, was strangled to death by another resident in 2019. The state coroner ruled it a homicide. The death doesn’t appear in inspection records at all. The facility has a five-star rating.,“The unfortunate incident was very isolated,” said Julie Beckert, a spokeswoman. She said staff responded “quickly and appropriately” to the strangulation.,In theory, health inspections can occur at any time, without notice.,But The Times found that in 2019 about 70 percent of nursing homes increased their staff on the days that inspectors visited, compared with their typical staffing levels on that day of the week.,On average, the homes added 25 hours of staff time — a roughly 8 percent increase — to their rosters on the day of the inspection. For more than 800 facilities, inspection day was the best-staffed day of the year.,The odds of that happening randomly are virtually zero, suggesting that many homes are able to anticipate their inspection dates.,When inspectors visited Mitchell-Hollingsworth Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Florence, Ala., on a Thursday in,September 2019, the home recorded its highest level of staffing all year: 785 total hours worked by nurses and aides, 15 percent higher than other Thursdays that year.,“We have absolutely no indication of when the inspectors are coming,” said Brian Scheri, the home’s administrator.,In some cases, corruption was to blame. In 2017, a state health inspector in Florida , to accepting $500,000 in bribes for telling homes about future inspections. Fifteen years earlier, the head of Oklahoma’s health department pleaded guilty to similar charges.,Nursing home staff and state-funded watchdogs said in interviews that hundreds of homes seemed to know in advance about the timing of inspections.,“Every home seemed to get a tip and would roll out the red carpet,” said Tony Cisney, a former inspector responsible for visiting about a dozen homes in Kentucky.,The coronavirus hit America’s nursing homes harder than any other part of the country. Nearly one out of every 10 nursing home residents died from Covid-19.,The pandemic laid bare the flaws in the government rating system.,The state health inspections do little to penalize homes with poor records of preventing and controlling infections. From 2017 to 2019, The Times found, inspectors cited nearly 60 percent — more than 2,000 — of the country’s five-star facilities at least once for not following basic safety precautions, like regular hand washing. Yet they earned top ratings.,In San Bernardino, Calif., inspectors wrote up Del Rosa Villa for four different infection-control violations. It kept its five stars. Ninety residents at the 104-bed facility have contracted the coronavirus, and 13 have died.,Del Rosa Villa officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.,Life Care Centers of Kirkland, Wash., the first nursing home in the United States to have documented coronavirus cases, was found in 2019 to have weak infection controls, despite its five stars. State inspectors wrote it up for failing to “consistently implement an effective infection control program.”,Thirty-nine of the facility’s , have died from Covid-19. The home has 190 beds.,Leigh Atherton, a Life Care spokeswoman, said that citation was the only lapse in infection control that inspectors had identified over 32 previous visits. She said the home quickly fixed the problem.,If the rating system worked as intended, it would have offered clues as to which homes were most likely to have out-of-control outbreaks and which homes would probably muddle through.,That is not what happened.,The Times found that there was little if any correlation between star ratings and how homes fared during the pandemic. At five-star facilities, the death rate from Covid-19 was only half a percentage point lower than at facilities that received lower ratings. And the death rate was slightly lower at two-star facilities than at four-star homes.,A facility’s location, the infection rate of the surrounding community and the race of nursing home residents , of whether a nursing home would suffer an outbreak. The star ratings didn’t matter.,That is consistent with academic research. , found little relationship between a facility’s star rating and its Covid-19 infection and death rates.,At Fulton Commons Care in East Meadow, N.Y., its five stars largely stemmed from its self-reported data, which researchers have found at times to be incorrect.,The home reported only 11 instances of residents taking serious falls between 2011 and 2015. The University of Chicago researchers, however, identified 40 falls for which residents were hospitalized. Similarly, Integra Med Analytics found that, at most, Fulton Commons was reporting to C.M.S. one-third of its residents’ pressure ulcers. The research firm , the home deserved one star, not five.,Fulton Commons officials did not respond to requests for comment.,Fulton Commons stopped allowing visitors last March. Automated phone calls assured family members that the virus hadn’t infiltrated the home.,Stasia Kochanowska died from Covid-19 on April 10. That same day, another resident, 88-year-old Adele Guyear, spoke to her daughter, Pamela Martin. Usually bubbly, Ms. Guyear now sounded terrified. She said her roommate had died from the virus. So had two women down the hall. And, Ms. Guyear told her daughter, she had a bad cough.,Ms. Martin initially had been comforted by the home’s five-star rating. But during the pandemic she had struggled to get her phone calls returned. Now, hearing from her mother, Ms. Martin began to panic.,She said she called the home and demanded that Ms. Guyear be sent to a hospital. There, she tested positive for Covid-19. Her mother survived, but she can’t breathe without supplemental oxygen, Ms. Martin said.,On May 15, health inspectors cited Fulton Commons for having a deficient program for preventing and controlling infections. C.M.S. , the problem as causing “minimal harm or the potential for actual harm.” The facility kept its five stars.,Forty-one Fulton Commons residents have died from Covid-19.,“Knowing what I know now,” Ms. Martin said, “you’d have to be crazy to give this place a five-star rating.”,The Times’s analysis of the star system’s effectiveness was based in large part on data submitted to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or C.M.S. The Times used data from ,, before the pandemic upended the industry and temporarily changed data-collection practices. The primary analysis examined the characteristics of homes with five-star ratings, including their staffing patterns and code violations.,The core data set was from the Nursing Home Compare system. That included the most recent set of star ratings for each facility and the underlying metrics. To see how these ratings changed over time, The Times also examined , and metrics going back to 2015.,The Times looked at all code violations reported in the three inspection cycles included in the January 2020 data.,The analysis also incorporated nursing homes’ 2019 , (daily logs of the hours worked by nurses, aides and administrators) and , (financial statements that facilities submit to the government). The cost reports were used to examine the relationship between profitability and the star system.,In addition, The Times used summary data provided by researchers who were granted access to individualized data on Medicare claims. By examining how often nursing home residents were admitted to hospitals , or complications from ,, the researchers demonstrated the extent to which facilities underreported serious health incidents in data they submit for ratings purposes.,Susan Beachy contributed research.",0
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/technology/turing-award-aho-ullman.html,business,"When Alfred Aho and Jeffrey Ullman met while waiting in the registration line on their first day of graduate school at Princeton University in 1963, computer science was still a strange new world.,Using a computer required a set of esoteric skills typically reserved for trained engineers and mathematicians. But today, thanks in part to the work of Dr. Aho and Dr. Ullman, practically anyone can use a computer and program it to perform new tasks.,On Wednesday, the Association for Computing Machinery, the world’s largest society of computing professionals, said Dr. Aho and Dr. Ullman would receive this year’s Turing Award for their work on the fundamental concepts that underpin computer programming languages. Given since 1966 and often called the Nobel Prize of computing, the Turing Award comes with a $1 million prize, which the two academics and longtime friends will split.,Dr. Aho and Dr. Ullman helped refine one of the key components of a computer: the “compiler” that ,.,Over the past five decades, computer scientists have built increasingly intuitive programming languages, making it easier and easier for people to create software for desktops, laptops, smartphones, cars and even supercomputers. Compilers ensure that these languages are efficiently translated into the ones and zeros that computers understand.,Without their work, “we would not be able to write an app for our phones,” said Krysta Svore, a researcher at Microsoft who studied with Dr. Aho at Columbia University, where he was chairman of the computer science department. “We would not have the cars we drive these days.”,The researchers also wrote many textbooks and taught generations of students as they defined how computer software development was different from electrical engineering or mathematics.,“Their fingerprints are all over the field,” said Graydon Hoare, the creator of a programming language called Rust. He added that two of Dr. Ullman’s books were sitting on the shelf beside him.,After leaving Princeton, both Dr. Aho, a Canadian by birth who is 79, and Dr. Ullman, a native New Yorker who is 78, joined the New Jersey headquarters of Bell Labs, which was then one of the world’s leading research labs.,Dr. Ullman, now professor emeritus at Stanford University, was also instrumental in developing the languages and concepts that drive databases, the software for storing and retrieving information that is essential to everything from the Google search engine to the applications used by office workers across the globe.,The ideas cultivated by Dr. Aho and Dr. Ullman are even a part of the computers of the future. At Microsoft, Dr. Svore is working on quantum computers, experimental machines that , exhibited by things like electrons or exotic metals cooled to several hundred degrees below zero.,Quantum computers rely on a completely different kind of physical behavior from traditional computers. But as they create programming languages for these machines, Dr. Svore and her colleagues are still drawing on the work of the latest Turing winners.,“We are building on the same techniques,” she said.",0
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/technology/personaltech/online-privacy-private-browsers.html,business,"Most of us use web browsers out of habit.,If you surf the web with Microsoft Edge, that may be because you use Windows. If you use Safari, that’s probably because you are an Apple customer. If you are a Chrome user, that could be because you have a Google phone or laptop, or you downloaded the Google browser on your personal device after using it on computers at school or work.,In other words, we turn to the browsers that are readily available and familiar. It’s easy to fall into browser inertia because these apps are all fast, capable and serve the same purpose: visiting a website.,So if the differences are minimal, why bother looking for something else?,By the end of this column, I hope to persuade you to at least try something else: a new type of internet navigator called a private browser. This kind of browser, from less-known brands like , and Brave, has emerged over the last three years. What stands out is that they minimize the data gathered about us by blocking the technologies used to track us.,That’s generally better than what most mainstream browsers, especially Chrome, do. While some browsers like Safari and , also include tracking prevention, the smaller brands have been focused on even more privacy protections.,We have also reached an inflection point in digital privacy. The online advertising industry is on the brink of ceasing to use web cookies, pieces of code planted in browsers that follow us from site to site and help target us with ads. Google, whose Chrome browser is the world’s most popular, has been trying to , without the cookie.,Let’s not wait for that. You can decide now that you don’t want to be tracked.,“We’re at a fork in the road,” said Gennie Gebhart, a director at the digital rights nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, who follows privacy issues. “Companies that keep the lights on by advertising to users, Google included, are scrambling to see what’s the next play. It’s also a time for users to be informed and make a choice.”,Unlike mainstream web browsers, private browsers come in many forms that serve different purposes. For about a week, I tested three of the most popular options — DuckDuckGo, Brave and Firefox Focus. Even I was surprised that I eventually switched to Brave as the default browser on my iPhone. Here’s how it happened.,It’s important to know what private browsers do, and what they don’t. So let’s look under the hood.,Private browsers generally incorporate web technologies that have been around for years:,Privacy-focused browsers typically turn private mode on by default, or automatically purge browsing history when you quit the browser. The browsers also have tracking prevention baked in, which lets them aggressively block trackers using approaches that minimize website breakage.,But private browsers do not prevent your internet provider from seeing what websites you visit. So if you are on vacation and using a hotel’s Wi-Fi connection, a private browser will not keep your browsing information private from the hotel’s internet provider. For that type of protection, you still need to connect to a ,, a technology that creates a virtual tunnel that shields your browsing information.,Firefox Focus, DuckDuckGo and Brave are all similar, but with some important differences.,Firefox Focus, available only for mobile devices like iPhones and Android smartphones, is bare-bones. You punch in a web address and, when done browsing, hit the trash icon to erase the session. Quitting the app automatically purges the history. When you load a website, the browser relies on a database of trackers to determine which to block.,The DuckDuckGo browser, also available only for mobile devices, is more like a traditional browser. That means you can bookmark your favorite sites and open multiple browser tabs.,When you use the search bar, the browser returns results from the DuckDuckGo search engine, which the company says is more focused on privacy because its ads do not track people’s online behavior. DuckDuckGo also prevents ad trackers from loading. When done browsing, you can hit the flame icon at the bottom to erase the session.,Brave is also more like a traditional web browser, with anti-tracking technology and features like bookmarks and tabs. It includes a private mode that must be turned on if you don’t want people scrutinizing your web history.,Brave is also so aggressive about blocking trackers that in the process, it almost always blocks ads entirely. The other private browsers blocked ads less frequently.,For most people, not seeing ads is a benefit. But for those who want to give back to a publisher whose ads are blocked, Brave hosts its own ad network that you can opt into. In exchange for viewing ads that do not track your behavior, you earn a cut of revenue in the form of a token. You can then choose to give tokens to websites that you like. (Only web publishers that have a partnership with Brave can receive tokens.),I tested all three browsers on my iPhone, setting each as my default browser for a few days.,All have a button to see how many trackers they blocked when loading a website. To test that, I visited nypost.com, the website of The New York Post, which loaded 83 trackers without any tracking prevention. With DuckDuckGo, 15 of the nypost.com trackers were blocked. With Brave, it was 22. And Firefox Focus blocked 47.,But numbers don’t tell the whole story. Firefox Focus sometimes broke elements of websites. On some sites, videos failed to load and ad windows could not be closed.,Selena Deckelmann, an executive at Mozilla, which makes Firefox, said that the strict privacy protections in Firefox Focus could sometimes cause websites to break and that the company worked with web publishers so their sites could load properly.,I didn’t experience major issues when using Brave or DuckDuckGo, though there was an occasional hiccup. In one case, when using DuckDuckGo to scroll through ,, our sister publication that tests and recommends products, the names of some products did not fully load. While the site was still functional, it looked odd.,In the end, though, you probably would be happy using any of the private browsers. Even if you don’t make one your default browser, it is useful for certain situations, like a sensitive web search on a health condition.,For me, Brave won by a hair. My favorite websites loaded flawlessly, and I enjoyed the clean look of ad-free sites, along with the flexibility of opting in to see ads whenever I felt like it. Brendan Eich, the chief executive of Brave, said the company’s browser blocked tracking cookies “without mercy.”,“If everybody used Brave, it would wipe out the tracking-based ad economy,” he said.,Count me in.",0

That muted response drew fierce criticism, as well as protests at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport and calls for a boycott.,But on Wednesday, Ed Bastian, Delta’s chief executive, made a stark reversal. “I need to make it crystal clear that the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta’s values,” he wrote in an internal memo that was reviewed by The New York Times.,Coca-Cola, another of Georgia’s largest companies, which had also declined to take a position on the legislation before it passed, made a similarly worded statement.,“I want to be crystal clear,” said James Quincey, Coca-Cola’s chief executive. “The Coca-Cola Company does not support this legislation, as it makes it harder for people to vote, not easier.”,Less than a day before the abrupt reversals, a group of prominent Black executives ,to publicly oppose a wave of similarly restrictive voting bills that Republicans are advancing in almost every state.,But the statements won’t change the outcome in Georgia, where the new law introduced stricter voter identification requirements for absentee balloting, limited drop boxes in predominantly Black neighborhoods and expanded the legislature’s power over elections.,“It is regrettable that the sense of urgency came after the legislation was passed and signed into law,” said Darren Walker, the president of the Ford Foundation and a board member at Ralph Lauren, Pepsi and Square.,Mr. Bastian decided to write the memo and revise the company’s position on Tuesday night after speaking with Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of American Express who helped organize ,, according to three people familiar with the conversation.,In the memo, Mr. Bastian said it was only after the law was passed that he truly understood the degree to which it would impose restrictions on Black voters.,“After having time to now fully understand all that is in the bill, coupled with discussions with leaders and employees in the Black community, it’s evident that the bill includes provisions that will make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives,” he said. “That is wrong.”,Mr. Bastian went further, saying the new law was based on false pretenses.,“The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections,” he said. “This is simply not true. Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights.”,Several other companies also weighed in on the issue on Wednesday.,Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, issued a statement on , saying the company was concerned about the wave of new restrictive voting laws. “BlackRock is concerned about efforts that could limit access to the ballot for anyone,” Mr. Fink said. “Voting should be easy and accessible for ALL eligible voters.”,Mark Mason, the chief financial officer of Citi, in a post on ,, called out the Georgia law as discriminatory.,“I am appalled by the recent voter suppression laws passed in the state of Georgia,” said Mr. Mason, who is Black. “I see it as a disgrace that our country’s efforts to keep Black Americans from engaging fully in our Constitutional right to vote continue to this day.”,Chuck Robbins, who is the chief executive of Cisco and grew up in Georgia, , on Twitter that “voting is a fundamental right in our democracy” and that “governments should be working to make it easier to vote, not harder.”,And Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, wrote a , about the Georgia law, detailing what he saw as the legislation’s failings and suggesting that corporate America try to get it changed.,“We hope that companies will come together and make clear that a healthy business requires a healthy community,” Mr. Smith said. “And a healthy community requires that everyone have the right to vote conveniently, safely, and securely. This new law falls short of the mark, and we should work together to press the Georgia legislature to change it.”,Andrew Ross Sorkin, contributed reporting.",3
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/suez-canal-ship-costs.html,business,"TOKYO — It took six days to , that ran aground and clogged the Suez Canal, one of the world’s most crucial shipping arteries. It could take years to sort out who will pay for the mess.,Cargo companies, insurers, government authorities and a phalanx of lawyers, all with different agendas and potential assessments, will need to determine not only the total damage but also what went wrong. When they eventually finish digging through the morass, the insurers of the ship’s Japanese owner are likely to bear the brunt of the financial pain.,The costs could add up quickly.,There are the repairs for any damage to the Ever Given, the quarter-mile-long ship that got stuck in the Suez. There is the bill for the tugboats and front-end loaders that dug the beached vessel out from the mud. The authority that operates the, has already said the crisis has cost the Egyptian government up to $90 million in lost toll revenue as hundreds of ships waited to pass through the blocked waterway or took other routes.,And the stalled ship , from moving through the canal, including cars, oil, livestock, laptops, sneakers, electronics and toilet paper. Companies delivering goods may have to pay customers for missed deadlines. If any agricultural goods went bad, producers may look to recoup lost revenue.,All of these cascading effects could amount to insurance claims in the hundreds of millions of dollars, as well as broader losses from the delays in the global supply chain.,The financial mess will ensnare a multinational web of businesses, led by the Japanese owner of the ship, its Taiwanese operator and the German management agent that hired the crew, as well as myriad cargo companies that rented space in the ship’s containers and a pool of insurance firms stretching from Tokyo to London.,The ultimate responsibility may fall to the insurers for the ship’s owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha, a subsidiary of the 120-year-old privately owned Japanese shipbuilder Imabari.,Teams from the German company that hired the crew and a consortium of insurers for the ship’s owner are just starting to investigate what caused the marooning of the Ever Given. Authorities in Panama, where the ship is registered, are also conducting an inquiry, as are investigators for other interested parties. Their findings, whether they align or not, will complicate questions of liability, keeping claims adjusters and lawyers busy for years as they sort through the finger-pointing.,Investigators want to know “who was responsible for the disruption — was it the crew, the pilots working for the Suez Canal Authority, or is it just an act of nature or a freak accident by the wind?” said ,, an associate professor of supply chain management at the Curtin Business School in Perth, Australia. ,Even after inquiries are completed, “it’s not clear cut,” Mr. Oloruntoba added. “It all depends on how good the lawyers are and also the contracts that were entered into.”,The most straightforward aspect is the damage to the ship and the canal. In the shipping business, those costs usually fall to the insurers of the ship’s owner, in this case a consortium led by Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance in Tokyo with Tokio Marine and Sompo Japan. Initial reports indicate that the ship did not suffer much harm and that there was no pollution leak.,The consortium is also likely to be on the hook for the salvage costs to free the ship, which swelled as experts and equipment were mobilized on short notice. Robert Mazzuoli, an insurance analyst at Fitch Ratings, estimated that bill could run into the tens of millions, although there are many variables.,The trickier piece of the puzzle is the cargo. Companies that booked containers on the Ever Given, as well as some of the 400 ships that had to wait in line outside the canal while it was jammed, may want to file claims.,But most insurance policies do not cover the economic losses for cargo delays. So companies will have to make a specific case as to why they are entitled to compensation. ,Such claims could reach hundreds of millions of dollars.,The ships carrying the most time-sensitive cargo, such as livestock or produce, could make the strongest argument. Those vessels, though, were allowed to go through first once the waterway was cleared.,For the most part, claims around cargo might be “impractical,” said ,, a lawyer in Taipei who specializes in commercial and transportation law.,“While the ship is just parked there, the cargo isn’t actually being damaged,” Mr. Lee said. “The only damage is that it’s delayed.”,“Say I have a batch of cloth, and on top of the time it took to come to Taiwan, it got stuck for six or seven days,” he said. “It just sat there. Will it go bad? It won’t.” ,There is a caveat. The ship’s owner could have to pay for cargo delays, if its crew is found to be at fault for the accident.,Some so-called third-party claims related to delayed cargo may be covered by yet another insurer for the ship, the UK P&I Club. The same goes for any claims by the Suez Canal Authority, which operates the waterway and might file over any loss of revenue.,Nick Shaw, chief executive of the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Clubs, the umbrella group that includes the UK P&I Club, said the insurer would “make decisions together with the shipowner as to which ones had validity and which ones are illegitimate.”,Adding to the complexity of the Suez accident are the layers upon layers of insurance. Reinsurers, companies that covers the risk of other insurance companies, come into play for claims above $100 million. Between insurance and reinsurance, the ship’s owner has coverage for those third-party claims up to $3.1 billion, although few experts believe the damages will run that high.,The sheer size of the Ever Given makes the situation all the more labyrinthine. Aside from time of war, the Suez Canal has never been blocked quite so spectacularly or for as long as it was by the Ever Given, and this is the biggest ship to run aground.,The ship is as long as the Empire State Building is tall, with the capacity to carry 20,000 containers stacked 12 to 14 high. The Ever Given is one of a fleet of 13 in a series designed by Imabari, part of a push to lower the costs per container and make the ships more competitive in an increasingly fierce market dominated by Chinese and South Korean shipbuilders.,“The bigger the ships get, the risk is whenever you have an incident like this is that you are putting more of your eggs into one basket,” said Simon Heaney, senior manager of container research at Drewry UK, a shipping consultancy. “So the claims will magnify.”,Raymond Zhong, and ,Amy Chang Chien, contributed reporting from Taipei, Taiwan. ,Vivian Yee, contributed from Cairo, and ,Makiko Inoue,, ,Hisako Ueno, and ,Hikari Hida, from Tokyo.",0
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/biden-electric-vehicles-infrastructure.html,business,"President Biden is a muscle-car guy — one of his , that he got from his father. But he’s trying to make this an electric vehicle world.,The , that he , is aimed at tackling climate change in part by spending up to $174 billion to encourage Americans to switch to cars and trucks that run on electricity, not gasoline or diesel. That is a large investment but it might not be enough to push most Americans toward E.V.s.,Despite rapid growth in recent years, electric vehicles remain a niche product, making up just 2 percent of the new car market and 1 percent of all cars, sport-utility vehicles, vans and pickup trucks on the road. They have been slow to take off in large part because they can cost up to $10,000 more than similar conventional cars and trucks. Charging E.V.s is also more difficult and slower than simply refilling the tank at far more prevalent gas stations.,Mr. Biden hopes to address many of those challenges through federal largess. He aims to lower the cost of electric vehicles by offering individuals, businesses and governments tax credits, rebates and other incentives. To address the chicken-and-egg problem of getting people to try a new technology before it is widely accepted, he hopes to build half a million chargers by 2030 so people will feel confident that they won’t be stranded when they run out of juice. And he is offering help to automakers to get them to build electric vehicles and batteries in the United States.,“We find ourselves at a unique moment here where most American businesses and many states are looking toward a decarbonized future, but recognize there’s a big lift on the infrastructure side,” said Bob Perciasepe, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, an environmental research group. “This investment alone obviously won’t solve the climate problem or fix all of the infrastructure in the United States but it will be a huge boost.”,Automakers see the writing on the wall and many, including ,. But even they acknowledge that they will need federal help.,“This transformation is greater than any one policy, branch or level of government, or industry sector,” a group representing ,. “It will require a sustained holistic approach with a broad range of legislative and regulatory policies rooted in economic, social, environmental and cultural realities.”,The letter called for grants, loans, tax credits and tax deductions to promote research and manufacturing. The authors of the letter, which included industry groups and the United Auto Workers union, called for investment in job training programs and federal help in promoting development of minerals and other raw materials in the United States.,But production is only one piece of the puzzle. The transition away from gas-powered vehicles rests on convincing consumers of the benefits of electric vehicles. That hasn’t been easy because the cars have higher sticker prices even though researchers say that they cost less to own. Electricity is cheaper on a per mile basis than gasoline, and E.V.s require less routine maintenance — there is no oil to change — than combustion-engine cars.,The single biggest cost of an electric car comes from the battery, which can run about $15,000 for a midsize sedan. That cost has been dropping and is widely expected to keep falling thanks to manufacturing improvements and technical advancements. But some scholars believe that a major technological breakthrough will be required to make electric cars much, much cheaper.,“There’s a good sense that at least for the next maybe five years or so they’re going to keep declining, but then are they going to level off or are they going to keep declining?” Joshua Linn, a professor at the University of Maryland and a senior fellow with Resources for the Future, an environmental nonprofit, said about battery costs. “That won’t be enough, so then that’s given rise to a lot of attention to infrastructure.”,The federal government and some states already offer tax credits and other incentives for the purchase of electric cars. But the main such federal incentive — a $7,500 tax credit for the purchase of new electric cars — begins to phase out for cars once an automaker has sold 200,000 E.V.s. Buyers of Tesla and G.M. electric cars, for example, no longer qualify for that tax credit but buyers of Ford and Volkswagen electric cars do.,Mr. Biden described his incentives for electric car purchases as rebates available at the “point of sale,” presumably meaning at dealerships or while ordering cars online. But the administration has not released details about how big those rebates will be and which vehicles they would apply to.,Another big concern is charging. People with dedicated parking spots typically charge their E.V.s overnight at home, but many people who live in apartments or have to drive longer distances need to use public charging stations, which are still greatly outnumbered by gas stations.,“The top three reasons consumers give for not buying E.V.s are lack of charging stations, time to charge, and the cost of E.V.s,” said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst at Guidehouse Insights. “They seem to be really emphasizing all three. So, over all, it looks very promising.”,There are ,, most with multiple pumps. Mr. Biden’s plan calls for a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers within the decade, up from , with more than 100,000 outlets today, according to the Energy Department.,“One of the things that needs to be addressed is getting chargers into places where people only have on-street parking, like in cities and urban areas where you don’t have a driveway or garage,” Mr. Abuelsamid said. “If they can address that, it will make E.V.s available to a lot more people.”,The government in China, which leads the world in the use of electric cars, has done much more than the United States to speed up the installation of chargers.,“It is, famously, one of the ways that China has become the No. 1 country in E.V.s on most dimensions,” John Paul MacDuffie, a professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email.,Even with incentives for manufacturers, a robust charging network and a willing public, the transition to electric cars may take a few decades. Carmakers have improved vehicle reliability in recent years, so many cars stay on the road a long time.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/basketball/nba-trades.html,sports,"All the trades have been made. This season’s roster shuffling, barring a free-agent signing or three coming soon, is complete.,It’s time, then, to take a tour around the league for some post-trade deadline fallout, rumbles, analysis and storytelling:,One of the Lakers’ prime off-season acquisitions, Schröder nonetheless featured in trade talks with the Toronto Raptors for Kyle Lowry. The discussions broke down over the Lakers’ unwillingness to include the blossoming Talen Horton-Tucker in a deal for Lowry, 35, who will become a free agent at season’s end.,Schröder, 27, was available because of the gulf between player and team in contract extension talks. He has rebuffed extension offers from the Lakers in the range of $80 million over four years, according to two people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to discuss them publicly. Schröder’s efficiency has slumped since his productive 2019-20 season in Oklahoma City, but he is said to be seeking more robust compensation in free agency this off-season. His previous biggest deal was a four-year, $70 million contract extension signed with Atlanta in October 2016.,More surprising than Schröder’s availability, given that gulf, was the Lakers’ willingness to package him with Kentavious Caldwell-Pope after Caldwell-Pope was such a key contributor to last season’s championship — and when Caldwell-Pope, like Anthony Davis and LeBron James, is represented by the influential agent Rich Paul.,Masai Ujiri, Toronto’s president of basketball operations, is also in the final year of his contract. There were strong rumbles last summer that Ujiri, General Manager Bobby Webster and Coach Nick Nurse were all poised to receive new five-year deals from the Raptors. Nurse and Webster have since signed long-term contracts, but Ujiri has repeatedly deflected questions about his future.,Like Lowry, Ujiri has been regarded by fans and the organization as Raptors royalty since the team’s championship run in 2018-19. It is widely presumed in league circles that only an overwhelming offer in a highly desirable market could lure him away from the influence and affection he has amassed in Toronto. Yet these many months without a deal and Webster’s rising profile as a natural successor have raised the question: How much longer will Ujiri be running the Raptors?,For a Canadian public edgy about the prospect of Lowry and Ujiri potentially hitting free agency at the same time, this counter question should provide some measure of comfort: Where would Ujiri go?,He was known to have interest in the Knicks’ job before James L. Dolan, the Knicks’ owner, abruptly decided last spring to abandon the pursuit of Ujiri to instead hire Leon Rose, a prominent former player agent. A worthy post-Toronto landing spot is difficult to pinpoint unless the Washington Wizards, who vehemently denied being interested after the Raptors’ championship, amend that stance.,Some around the league, though, have wondered about a potential down-the-road option that does not yet exist. The group heading expansion efforts in Seattle features the longtime sports executive Tim Leiweke, who brought Ujiri to Toronto for the 2013-14 season.,The recent bargain signings of Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge, after the January acquisition of James Harden, have further entrenched the Nets as villains. Coach Steve Nash leaned in to the criticism with some humor when he spoke to reporters on Monday, letting out ,.,“It’s kind of funny to me, because for the last couple years, all I’ve heard is how bad I am,” Griffin said. “You sign with this team and everybody’s like, ‘That’s not fair.’”,The volume on complaints surely would have been higher had the Nets been successful in their attempts to trade the injured Spencer Dinwiddie for a wing player. Among the options they explored, I’m told, was sending Dinwiddie to Golden State for Kelly Oubre. Golden State rejected those overtures because it is still desperate to make the playoffs. While numerous Oubre trade scenarios came up, Golden State was not going to trade him for someone who couldn’t help the team in the short term.,“I think a lot of people thought he might be available, but we value him, too, as evidenced by not trading him,” Bob Myers, Golden State’s president of basketball operations, said of Oubre on Friday.,The Bulls, Nuggets and Magic are known (and sometimes criticized) for not pursuing trades as aggressively as fans would like. So you applaud Denver for making the most ambitious move in the West by trading for the Magic’s Aaron Gordon, which not only enhances the Nuggets’ ability to win the conference but also shouldn’t hinder them in the Bradley Beal sweepstakes if (when?) Washington reaches the point of making Beal available.,The Nikola Vucevic trade, furthermore, was bold for both Orlando and Chicago. The Bulls, who had no All-Stars when Chicago hosted last season’s All-Star Game, packaged two future first-round picks and Wendell Carter Jr. to get Vucevic, who played in his second All-Star Game this season — as did a first-timer: Chicago’s Zach LaVine.,The Magic turned heads, too, by initiating a total tear down and trading Vucevic, Gordon and Evan Fournier after they had been pretty convincing in the weeks leading up to the deadline that Vucevic was staying put. With Vucevic, at age 30, in the midst of his most productive season and seemingly getting better offensively, I thought he was the one Magic pillar they were bound to keep to lead younger players like Jonathan Isaac and Markelle Fultz when they return from injury. Several teams were convinced Orlando wouldn’t part with Vucevic unless it received a substantial offer; Chicago duly put more on the table than anticipated.,Trevor Ariza and Andre Drummond, two of the league’s most prized veterans as title contenders fortify their rosters for the playoffs, worked out in the same Miami gym in recent months.,Ariza and Drummond are among the prominent players who have been practicing at The Miami Perimeter with Stanley Remy, who trains Miami’s Jimmy Butler. Ariza made it his base while on leave awaiting a trade from the Oklahoma City Thunder, who dealt him to the Heat on March 17. Drummond trained in the same gym after he and the Cleveland Cavaliers agreed in February to seek a trade. When the Cavaliers couldn’t find a desirable deal, they negotiated a buyout with Drummond, who signed on Sunday with the Lakers.,Other veterans who have been spotted in Remy’s gym include the veteran center Greg Monroe and, in a surprise, Amar’e Stoudemire. As a , for the Nets this season, Stoudemire, 38, works with the team at home. Yet he does not travel with the Nets and has made occasional trips to Miami to see family when the team is on the road. Stoudemire has also been pursuing an M.B.A. through online classes at the University of Miami., — @MoneyDre123 from Twitter, — @MoneyDre123 from Twitter, You sent me multiple tweets in the past few days that hit on two newsy topics, so let’s address both.,Surprising as it was to see Aldridge choose to join the Nets over Miami, it is no surprise that the Nets have made multiple signings. A free-spending title contender will always hold appeal to former All-Stars like Aldridge and Griffin, who not only covet the chance to compete for a championship but are also trying to rebuild their value as they head to free agency in the off-season.,The surprise here is the development of Brown and Claxton. I don’t remember many touting them to both become dependable rotation players so quickly — whether that’s because of faster-than-anticipated development or the natural benefit of the extra space created by offensive threats like Harden, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. Or both.,This was the fourth consecutive season in which deadline day delivered a double-digit number of trades, and I expect the trend to continue. I can still vividly remember deadline day in 2000, when Atlanta’s dealing Anthony Johnson to Orlando was the only sad little trade to go down, but this is a different N.B.A.,You have to go back to 2009 for the last deadline day that featured fewer than eight trades. Although that certainly doesn’t mean we’re going to see landscape-changers every year, I will concede that last week’s activity exceeded even optimistic expectations like mine — even with Toronto’s Kyle Lowry staying put., — Johnny Tse (Hong Kong), Last seen in the league playing a minor role off the Lakers’ bench during their championship run last summer, Waiters is another one of the free agents who has been working out at The Miami Perimeter gym discussed in this week’s lead item.,Though that doesn’t mean that Waiters, 29, will get another N.B.A. shot, Brandon Knight has also been working out there and, according to a report from my longtime colleague ,, recently earned an audition with the Milwaukee Bucks.,Among the factors working against Waiters: There are a lot of proven N.B.A. players competing for roster spots. I asked a noted salary-cap guru and transaction tracker, @KeithSmithNBA, to help me compile a list of well-known free agents without regard to position. A partial list from what he came up with: DeMarcus Cousins, Jamal Crawford, Yogi Ferrell, John Henson, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson, Damian Jones, Mfiondu Kabengele, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Jeremy Lin, James Nunnally, Jabari Parker, Andre Roberson, Iman Shumpert, J.R. Smith and Isaiah Thomas., — Bruce Klutchko (New York), I love hearing how much you enjoy it, and we are very much on the same page on this, but perhaps that didn’t come through as clearly as I hoped in ,.,Various coaches and players have said that the advent of baseball-style series this season, in which teams play host to the same opponent in consecutive games to reduce travel, has been a factor in lessening home-court advantage in today’s N.B.A. Pinpointing exactly how much is not possible, but there are presumed sleep and rest benefits for players on visiting teams when they get to stay in one city longer. Put it on the list as a factor in the road teams’ favor along with the more inviting arena atmospheres for visiting teams given the reduced crowds (or empty buildings).,We will keep tracking the numbers all season, but I don’t see how anyone can dispute that playing the same opponent twice in a row, especially with a night off in between, results in more favorable conditions for the visiting team.,The worst might be behind the N.B.A. in terms of dealing with the coronavirus — at least during the regular season. If the league can get through two more days, it will have made it through the entire month of March without postponing a single game in accordance with the league’s health and safety protocols. The league postponed , in December, January and February because at least one team could not field the minimum required eight players in uniform because of either positive coronavirus tests or contact tracing.,The Nets and the two Los Angeles teams (Lakers and Clippers) are the only teams to avoid a game postponement according to the league’s health and safety protocols.,Twenty-seven of the league’s 30 teams made at least one trade during the season, including 23 last Thursday on deadline day. The only teams that did not make an in-season deal: Memphis, Minnesota and the Los Angeles Lakers.,The Knicks were the first team to surpass their projected over/under win total, according to ,. The Knicks’ over/under was a league-low 21.5 victories; they entered Tuesday’s play tied with the Charlotte Hornets for fourth in the Eastern Conference at 24-23.,Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge, both represented by Excel Sports, surrendered an estimated $19.1 million in combined salary to become unrestricted free agents and sign veteran minimum contracts to join the Nets. Griffin (who gave back $13.3 million to Detroit) and Aldridge ($5.8 million to San Antonio) have joined DeAndre Jordan, Jeff Green and Nicolas Claxton in a suddenly crowded Nets frontcourt. With Joe Harris no less a fixture in the Nets’ closing lineup than their big-name stars, five big men are vying for limited minutes.",2
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-tournament-final-four.html,sports,"With some blowouts and plenty of busted brackets, we have arrived at the , men’s Final Four. And the semifinal matchups promise some good story lines with a Texas intrastate clash and a top-seeded juggernaut facing one of the last teams selected to be in the field of 68.,The four that remain: , and ,. Here’s a look at each team’s strengths and weaknesses ahead of their semifinals on Saturday.,After its 81-72 win against Arkansas, Baylor (28-3) made it to its first Final Four since 1950 and the Bears look as ready as ever. The Bears, the top seed in the South region, are a strong defensive team that is going to give Houston its most challenging matchup in the tournament. The Bears also have great 3-point shooting — the best in the men’s game at 41 percent.,Baylor is led by three skilled guards — Jared Butler, MaCio Teague and Davion Mitchell — who combine to score 46.5 of the team’s 83 average points per game.,The important thing for Baylor is to take advantage of its shooting strengths. Houston’s defense is a hard one to get past, but Baylor has the shooters to do it. They just have to make the shots.,Baylor struggles with turnovers, averaging 11.7 per game. That carelessness with the ball sometimes hurts the Bears, like it did when they allowed Arkansas to make a comeback from 17 points down. Houston’s elite and quick defense could take advantage if that happens again.,Defense, defense, defense — No. 2-seeded Houston (28-3) out of the Midwest region is great at it. The Cougars are making their first Final Four appearance since 1984 and looking like a team ready and able to stop any offense in its path. Houston is able to close in quick and force turnovers, making it the second best defense in men’s Division I, holding opponents to just 57.6 points per game.,Houston is led by Quentin Grimes, a transfer from Kansas who has found much success with the Cougars. Grimes averages 18 points and 5.8 rebounds and is key to the team’s offensive strategy.,The Cougars are also a great rebounding team, which will be particularly important against Baylor’s 3-point shooting to take those second-chance points away from the Bears.,Houston has to be able to either set the pace of the game or keep up with Baylor on the offensive end. It is clearly a strong team when it comes to preventing its opponents from making shots, but Houston still must make its own.,Grimes is important for the Cougars offense, but he isn’t all of it, and can’t be if Houston expects to beat Baylor.,Undefeated No. 1-seeded Gonzaga (30-0) is not the team to make mistakes around. The Bulldogs, who easily won the West region, are dominant because they take advantage of turnover opportunities to score. This team also shares the ball well, averaging 18.6 assists.,The Bulldogs also score an average of 91.8 points per game — the most of any men’s team in Division I. They are extremely efficient, push the pace and can keep up with any kind of defense.,Gonzaga is led by Corey Kispert, who averages 19 points. Close behind is Drew Timme, averaging 18.9 points and 7.2 rebounds — he has scored a combined 45 points in the last two games. He is one of the most multifaceted players in college basketball and is one of several pro prospects among the Bulldogs.,No one has shown itself able to really threaten the Zags in their attempt to be the first undefeated champion since Indiana in 1976. It will be a big challenge for U.C.L.A. to get in the way.,Gonzaga is good, if not great, at most things. It made Southern California look completely outclassed on Tuesday night and showed some well-earned swagger in the process. But U.C.L.A. has toppled plenty of other teams in this tournament, including top-seeded Michigan.,U.C.L.A., a No. 11 seed who had to play a First Four game just to enter the round of 64, is easily the surprise of this semifinal quartet after winning the East region. Coach Mick Cronin has no players with previous N.C.A.A. tournament experience on his roster. The Bruins are here for the first time since 2008, and are the second team to go from a play-in game to the Final Four.,The Bruins have had quite a path here, playing in two overtime games, including in the First Four against Michigan State. Upsetting Michigan, 51-49, they found a way to force the Wolverines into turnovers and take advantage. If the Bruins have proved anything in this tournament, it is resilience.,U.C.L.A. is a talented 3-point shooting team at 37.2 percent. Johnny Juzang averages 15 points and 4.1 rebounds, and he has continued to contribute in big ways even while contending with an ankle injury during the postseason. He scored 28 points in the round of 8 win.,“Nobody picked this, nobody believed in us,” Cronin said in a sideline interview after the win against Michigan. “That’s how we like it.”,The U.C.L.A. bench had no points in its win against Michigan. Its lack of depth could be a big problem against the versatile Bulldogs. If the Bruins don’t get contributions beyond their starters, they will have an even steeper climb keeping up with Gonzaga’s quick offense.,The Bruins have also struggled from the free throw line in their last few games which could cause problems, especially if they are being forced to drive instead of taking shots from behind the arc.,It is no secret that the Bruins are going to have to play the best game of their season to compete with Gonzaga, but they have been full of surprises this postseason.",2
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-womens-final-four-preview.html,sports,"The women’s basketball Final Four has all the narratives a fan could want.,A dynastic Connecticut program looking to reclaim its spot at the top. A traditionally great Stanford program aiming to recapture its former glory. South Carolina, the nation’s newest power, is establishing itself as a perennial contender. And Arizona, the Final Four first-timer, is working to make its mark.,If you missed this week’s games, and even if you didn’t, here’s a primer on what to look forward to in Friday’s national semifinals, where Stanford will play South Carolina before UConn faces Arizona.,It is probably a surprise to no one that Connecticut is in the Final Four. But predictably or not, and for the 13th consecutive season, Coach Geno Auriemma and his team are competing in the national semifinals after eking out a round of 8 win over Baylor. The Bears had led the Huskies by as many as 10 points, but crumbled after losing arguably their most important player, the national defensive player of the year DiDi Richards, to a hamstring injury late in the third quarter.,The Huskies’ close win showed the team’s strengths, and where the young squad and its freshman starters still occasionally stumble. First among those strengths is the freshman Paige Bueckers, who scored 28 points in the victory over Baylor, and has averaged 22.5 points in four tournament games.,“Paige does a lot of things that you can’t explain,” Auriemma said. “There are a lot of things that Paige has to learn, that she doesn’t handle so great right now. But like all great players, she can sense the moment, and she has the ability to fill that moment.”,The biggest boost for Connecticut so far in the tournament, though, has been the top-tier play of those around Bueckers. Christyn Williams and Evina Westbrook have given the team a boost from behind the 3-point line, and the 6-foot-4 Olivia Nelson-Ododa has become an unlikely distributor, with 11 assists in her past two games.,It has been five years since Connecticut’s last title, as long of a gap as the program has had between championships since it won its first in 1995.,Arizona’s first trip to the Final Four has come courtesy of Aari McDonald, its star senior guard, who poured in 64 points in wins over Texas A&M and Indiana this week and has been an unstoppable force on both ends of the floor.,“When you know, you know you’re feeling it,” McDonald told reporters after the game. “I wasn’t doing too well in the regular season, taking bad shots and stuff. But now I’m really just taking what the defense is giving me.”,While McDonald, the Pac-12 player of the year, has led the way offensively, forward Trinity Baptiste has given the team some much-needed size and even contributed a double-double against Indiana. The Wildcats play a relentless, high-energy defense that forces a lot of turnovers, especially against teams that underestimate them.,“We just need this confidence and momentum going into UConn,” McDonald said. “UConn, we already know what they’re about: powerhouse, well-coached, skillful players. But hey, I got my chances with my teammates. Ride or die, I’m going to war with them.”,When South Carolina won its first national title in 2017, the Gamecocks had the best player in the country in A’ja Wilson, the 2020 W.N.B.A. most valuable player. Coach Dawn Staley’s team looked ready to claim another trophy last season, going 32-1 behind a group of young talent that — while it didn’t yet have, S.C. — looked good enough to deserve one.,Then the pandemic hit, and the Gamecocks’ momentum was (temporarily) halted. This season, South Carolina lost four times — all to ranked teams, and while still showing some of the immaturity of its young core.,“When we got knocked down four times this season, they got back up stronger, and I like that,” Staley said after Tuesday’s win against Texas sent her team back to the Final Four. “They haven’t even scratched the surface of how good they can be. We’re happy, but we’re not done yet.”,The 6-foot-5 center Aliyah Boston typically fuels both the defense and the offense, scoring efficiently under the basket, but increasingly South Carolina’s quick guards have stepped into starring roles. The junior Destanni Henderson and the sophomore Zia Cooke are scoring threats anywhere on the floor, and the Gamecocks are playing their best basketball of the season.,Stanford breezed through its first three tournament games, barely breaking a sweat as they hit 43 3-pointers. Then they met up with a scrappy Louisville team on Tuesday that spent more than half of the game in the lead; at one point in the third quarter, Louisville led by 14 points.,But Stanford rallied behind its typically balanced shooting. Bench players like the 6-foot-5 sophomore Ashten Prechtel, who played only 16 minutes but made all six of her shots, offered key contributions when shots by Stanford’s senior leader, Kiana Williams, weren’t falling.,Stanford, the top overall seed in this year’s tournament, regained its footing because it has so many players who can shoot. Even in a game when it wasn’t scoring confidently, the Cardinal still made seven 3-pointers.,“I just had to change my mentality,” Williams said after Stanford rallied to claim its 14th Final Four appearance under ,. “I was forcing things — I think I wanted it too bad. Once I got that first shot to go in, it started going from there.”,Facing a big tournament test against Louisville has likely better equipped the Cardinal what’s to come against South Carolina on Friday. Now, the challenge for Stanford will be whether its defense can stifle a team with as many skillful shooters as its own.",2

The Washington Nationals announced on Wednesday that one of their players had tested positive for the coronavirus and that, because of contact-tracing protocols, four more players and one staff member who had close contact with that player would also be held out of their game against the visiting Mets on Thursday.,The Nationals did not name the player who tested positive or the others who are in the protocols, but Mike Rizzo, the team’s general manager, said he had learned of the positive test at about 1:20 a.m. on Wednesday. The team flew back to Washington on Monday after its last spring-training game.,The positive test also occurred on Monday, Rizzo said. He added that the team had no positive test results during the six weeks of spring training.,Team personnel were given more tests on Wednesday, but Rizzo said he did not have the results when he spoke to reporters on Wednesday afternoon. It is possible the number of players in the protocols could change before Thursday’s game, but Rizzo said the game was not likely to be postponed.,“We’ve got a long season ahead of us,” Rizzo said. “The difference this year is it’s 162 and we are ready for the long haul. This is just a small blip on our radar screen. We are going to handle it and take it in stride.”,Max Scherzer, the scheduled starting pitcher for the Nationals on Thursday, said that he had flown back with his family, separately from the team, and that he still expected to pitch.,“We had done so well in spring training, everyone across the game,” Scherzer said. “We had seen so few positive cases across spring training as a whole. It just shows how quickly that can turn.”,Last year Juan Soto, the Nationals’ star outfielder, missed the first eight games of the season after he tested positive for the coronavirus before the team’s season opener against the Yankees. Soto later said he thought it was a false positive.,Also in 2020, M.L.B. suspended activities during spring training in March because of the pandemic. When the league returned in July to start its 60-game regular season, several teams had games postponed because of positive tests.,Turner’s positive test forced him to be taken out of Game 6 of the World Series before the start of the eighth inning. He was criticized for coming back onto the field to ,, especially because he appeared in a team photograph without a face mask.,Baseball executives, players, staff members and fans all remain hopeful for a more normal season this year, but the revelation of the positive test on Wednesday served as a reminder to keep expectations in check.,“It will be a little more normal than it was last year,” Rizzo said of opening day, “but certainly a long way from normal.”",2
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/soccer/soccer-streetwear-juventus.html,sports,"The lights at the Allianz Stadium cut out, and the music swelled. In the darkness, a small patch in the middle of the field seemed to glow. The center circle started to pulse and ripple. And then the , appeared to get pulled away, as if it were nothing more than a tablecloth. Three words ran around the electronic advertising boards: “History. Passion. Lols.”,The extravagant buildup did not seem to match the occasion. Juventus was at home to Genoa that night, a run-of-the-mill Serie A game. It was late October 2019, much too early in the season for the title to be decided or a trophy to be won. What mattered, though, was not what Juventus was playing for, but what the team was playing in.,That night, Cristiano Ronaldo and his teammates would showcase a special edition jersey, designed in collaboration with its apparel partner, Adidas, and Palace, the maverick British skate and streetwear brand.,The design toyed with the history and passion of Juventus, incorporating the team’s traditional bianconero,stripes and the disruptive touches that had made Palace a streetwear phenomenon. The team’s logos and the player’s numbers were displayed in an acidic green. Toward the bottom, the stripes started to pixelate.,The jersey was greeted as a ,, but Juventus would never wear it again. By the time Ronaldo and his teammates took to the field against Torino a few days later, they were back in their regular uniforms. It did not matter. Later that week, the Palace jersey came online — or, as the streetwear world would put it, dropped.,It sold out in 12 hours.,A couple of years earlier, Juventus had held a , at the Museum of Science and Technology in Milan. The guest list included players past and present, but also pop-culture fixtures like Giorgio Moroder, the pioneering music producer, and the model and actress Emily Ratajkowski.,The party was arranged to herald the dawn of a new era for the club. Its team was in the middle of an unmatched period of success on the field, establishing a run of dominance in Serie A, however, it risked being left behind by its Continental rivals. To remain competitive, it needed to close the revenue gap on clubs like Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United, its chairman, Andrea Agnelli said. To do that, he was convinced, Juventus had to become “more pop.”,He is not the only executive in European soccer to have that thought. In 2018, fans lined up around the block outside the Parc des Princes to get their hands on the first drop of , between Paris St.-Germain and Jordan Brand, a subsidiary of its primary apparel partner, Nike. Earlier this year, ,, a streetwear brand based in Los Angeles.,As with the audience for Juventus’s collection with Palace, the core market for these collaborations is not the club’s fans. It is not even, necessarily, fans of the sport. The collections are not intended to be worn as soccer products or as declarations of loyalty to a team; the tie-ins are not, as they are often presented, attempts by Europe’s insatiable superclubs to sell more tickets or to pick up more fans.,“A lot of the people buying those P.S.G. Jordan shirts will not care about the team’s league position,” said Jordan Wise, a founder of , magazine and ,. “Many of them may not even like football.” That is precisely their value to clubs: an entirely untapped market, one not subject to the vicissitudes and tribalism that affect soccer fans.,“Working with streetwear brands gives the clubs access to a completely different space,” Wise said. “But to do that, they have to think and look different: less like clubs, and more like sportswear brands.”,No team has embraced that shift quite like Juventus. In 2016, at Agnelli’s instigation, the club decided to embark on a comprehensive rebrand. Every aspect of the team’s identity would be in play, including, most controversially, its iconic crest, a symbol that had roots stretching back more than a century.,“It was more than just a change in the badge,” said Giorgio Ricci, Juventus’s chief revenue officer. “It was a new visual identity, one which would enable us to be seen as innovative, one step ahead.”,The club put the rebrand idea out to a number of marketing agencies, and eventually selected a pitch from Interbrand, a longstanding partner. Its approach had been risky: After consulting the company’s global network of creatives, Lidi Grimaldi, the managing director of Interbrand’s Milan bureau, decided against presenting the club with a suite of options, spreading their bets in the hopes that one caught the imagination.,Instead, she said, Interbrand decided to go in with one design. Though the company had previously helped tweak the Juventus crest, making it a little less ornate, altering the color scheme a touch, this time Interbrand would suggest something more revolutionary. “Something really bold,” she said. ,They did not have much time. Because Juventus and Adidas needed to start work on the club’s jerseys for the next season, Interbrand had less than a month to get its ideas together. Rather than something that looked like a soccer crest, it designed a logo that had “more in common with Google or Apple or Nike,” Grimaldi said.,There would be no depiction of a charging bull, as there had been on every version of the crest for more than a century. There would not even be a crest, as such: just a sleek and stylized J, a design that would form the centerpiece of and inspiration for an updated visual identity. That was no accident. “The whole strategy was to widen the spectrum of activities without abandoning the club’s core, which is football,” she said.,To present the idea to the Juventus board, Interbrand made a short film, one that offered a glimpse into what this bold new future might look like: , emblazoned on cafes and hotels, adorning events, used in collaborations with cutting-edge fashion brands. The Juventus executives, including Agnelli, were thrilled, Grimaldi said. This was precisely the sort of sea change they had been seeking. The main response, she said, was: “Wow.”,The club, of course, knew such a drastic change would not be universally welcomed. When the new logo was revealed, the reaction from fans was — at best — ,. Juventus felt it had no choice but to ride out the storm.,“We needed a new identity that could change the perception of Juventus among different stakeholders,” Ricci said. “One that could enlarge the scope and potential targets of our business. We needed a new identity that was suitable not just for core customers, but for new audiences, something that could be a trigger for creators.”,Perhaps the best measure of its success came on Tuesday. After a similarly intensive design period, Inter Milan — Juventus’s fierce domestic rival — ,, a simplified version of the badge that has graced the club’s jerseys for decades. Imitation, after all, is the sincerest form of flattery.,For years, Manchester United has been held up as soccer’s gold standard in converting the sport’s unparalleled popularity into cold, hard cash.,The partnership model it pioneered, combining 25 official club partners with a jumble of regional partners around the world, might have made it an easy target for satire — all those , and , endorsements — but it has also turned the club into a financial powerhouse, capable of , even during the coronavirus pandemic.,Increasingly, though, the consumption habits of younger people are making that approach seem outdated. “We’re seeing a move away from the licensing model,” Wise said. “We know that Generation Z and millennials hate being sold to. That means it’s no longer enough to plaster a club’s badge on something and assume fans will buy it out of loyalty.”,Instead, he said, partnerships must feel “authentic,” and the content used to promote them must “tell stories.” That authenticity was the logic behind the Juventus rebrand, not only of its crest but of the club’s whole visual persona, from its social media — using , — to its branding.,“It was about placing soccer in the broader entertainment framework,” Ricci said. “We see our competition not just as clubs, but things like the gaming industry.”,For partners, the appeal is obvious. Soccer has a reach that no other aspect of culture can match. Cristiano Ronaldo has more , than anyone else on the planet. Lionel Messi might , his rival there, but it will be some solace that he is, at least, ahead of ,.,Likewise, Juventus has a name recognition that can supercharge a brand like Palace. The difference is that, increasingly, soccer has to give a little, too. It has to accept the principles of what Grimaldi called “strategic design,” the idea that design itself can change consumer behavior and expectations.,“The rebrand was not a way of being cooler or more contemporary,” Grimaldi said. “It was a chance to show you understand the verbal and visual codes you have to adopt if you want to be understood in other spaces. To do work with Palace, for example, you have to adopt the design codes of their world.”,It is, though, a slow burn. Four years since its rebrand, Juventus is not in a position to pinpoint any immediate financial boost, which has traditionally been the primary motivation and metric for anything any soccer club does. When looking at the club’s books, Ricci said, it is hard to isolate what is a consequence of the rebrand, and what is a result of winning trophies or signing Cristiano Ronaldo.,He is, though, “absolutely convinced” that it was worth it. Internally, the new identity gave the club a sense of direction, he said. Externally, the outrage over the new badge subsided fairly quickly: Signing Ronaldo and picking up another handful of Serie A titles meant the club’s traditional fans did not feel alienated.,But at the same time, it meant that Juventus had become something more than a team, something more like a sportswear brand, too.,It is still occasionally possible to buy one of those original pixelated, acid green, special-edition Palace jerseys in streetwear’s thriving resale market. Prices start at several hundred dollars, far more than even the newest Juventus jersey. And how the team is doing on the field makes not the slightest bit of difference.",1

We’ve got everything completed, signed, sealed and delivered. However, we can’t release it without the permission of the people involved in the collision.”,Woods, 45, sustained severe injuries to his right leg on Feb. 23, requiring at least two operations after the S.U.V. he was driving crashed onto a hillside along a tricky stretch of road in Los Angeles County. No one but Woods, the pre-eminent figure in golf over the past quarter-century, was involved, according to the authorities.,The sheriff has maintained that the crash was an accident, saying that he and his deputies did not detect signs of impairment at the scene that day. However, he said about a week later that investigators had gotten a search warrant for the event data recorder, also known as a black box, in Woods’s S.U.V. to help clarify the cause of the crash.,“It’s still an accident,” he said Wednesday. “You have an accident, and you have deliberate acts. It’s an accident, OK. We’re reaching out to Tiger Woods to be able to release the report itself, and nothing has changed from what we know and what we learned throughout the course of the investigation. And everything we did turned out to be accurate.”,Woods’s longtime agent, Mark Steinberg, did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.,Here is what we know as of Wednesday night.,Woods was released last month from a Los Angeles hospital where he was treated after the crash, according to a post to his Twitter account on March 16 that said he was at home.,“I will be recovering at home and working on getting stronger every day,” the Twitter post on Tuesday read.,Woods’s only known residence is in Jupiter Island, Fla., where he lives in a mansion — sometimes with his two children, custody of whom he shares with his ex-wife.,The post did not contain updates on his condition, and Steinberg, Woods’s agent, said in an email that he could not offer any further information on his client’s location or condition.,Woods was taken to Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles on the day of the crash and underwent emergency surgery to repair serious injuries to his right leg.,He was , Medical Center in Los Angeles on the evening of Feb. 25.,The morning after Woods’s arrival at Cedars-Sinai, he received “follow-up procedures on his injuries,” which were deemed successful, according to a statement from Woods’s Twitter account.,Dr. Anish Mahajan, the acting chief executive of Harbor-U.C.L.A., said , the night after the crash that both bones in Woods’s lower right leg, the tibia and the fibula, had been broken in multiple places and were “open fractures,” meaning the bones had pierced his skin.,Dr. Mahajan said doctors had “stabilized” the breaks by placing a rod in the tibia. He said that additional bones in Woods’s ankle and foot had also been injured and that they had been “stabilized with a combination of screws and pins.”,The statement did not describe any injuries to Woods’s left leg, though Daryl L. Osby, the Los Angeles County fire chief, had said earlier that Woods had “serious injuries” to both legs. The chief did not explain further and said he was not sure what other injuries Woods might have sustained.,Doctors not involved in Woods’s care have predicted an , from his injuries.,The warrant to inspect the black box’s data was executed on March 1 as part of a “routine procedure,” a spokeswoman for the Sheriff’s Department said last month.,When asked why the department had not sought a warrant for blood samples from the hospital, which would indicate whether Woods had alcohol or drugs in his system, Sheriff Villanueva said in a livestream on March 3 that there was no evidence of impairment.,“Absent the evidence of impairment, you know, you’re not going to get a search warrant,” the sheriff said. “Period. It’s not getting assigned by the judge.”,Though the investigation continued, Sheriff Villanueva was quite clear at a news conference on Feb. 24 that he believed the crash was accidental. “We don’t contemplate any charges whatsoever in this crash,” he said. “This remains an accident, and an accident is not a crime.”,Drug recognition experts — police officers trained to identify people suspected of being impaired — were not dispatched to either the site of the crash or the hospital, Sheriff Villanueva added.,Although Woods appeared “lucid and calm” immediately after the accident and was able to answer questions from Deputy Carlos Gonzalez, the first emergency responder to arrive at the scene, he “had no recollection of the crash itself” when asked at the hospital, Villanueva said in a Feb. 24 ,.,Forensic experts from across the country who are not involved in the investigation told USA Today, for an , published on March 13, that it appeared to be either a case of falling asleep at the wheel or of impaired or distracted driving.,The crash occurred on Hawthorne Boulevard near Rancho Palos Verdes, a coastal city of about 42,000 people in Los Angeles County.,According to data collected by the Sheriff’s Department, there were 13 accidents, four with injuries, from Jan. 3, 2020, to Feb. 23 of this year within a 1.35-mile stretch of Hawthorne Boulevard that includes the site where Woods crashed, according to data collected by the Sheriff’s Department.,Only one of those accidents was officially determined to have involved a person under the influence of drugs or alcohol, according to the data, and none involved someone using a phone. Two of the 13 accidents were single-vehicle crashes, and the data indicated that neither driver in those cases had been driving under the influence.,The speed limit there is 45 miles per hour, but Deputy Gonzalez said he had sometimes seen vehicles going more than 80 miles per hour. Sheriff Villanueva said it appeared that Woods had been driving at a “greater speed than normal” on the day of the accident.,Officers arrived at the scene six minutes after receiving a 911 call and found Woods trapped in an S.U.V. that had rolled over, Sheriff Villanueva said on the day of the crash.,The vehicle Woods was driving hit the median strip, traveled several hundred feet and rolled several times before stopping in the brush on the other side of the road, Sheriff Villanueva said. There were no skid or swerve marks, indicating that Woods had made no attempt to brake, the sheriff said. The bumper and the front end of the car were “destroyed,” but the interior cabin of the vehicle was “more or less intact,” he added.,There was no evidence that Woods was being followed or looking at his phone, the sheriff said at the time of the crash. Weather was also not a factor in the crash, he said. Woods was wearing his seatbelt, and airbags in the car deployed, Deputy Gonzalez said.,Woods was in Southern California to host, but not to compete in, the Genesis Invitational at the Riviera Country Club in the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles the weekend before the crash. Genesis Motor is a luxury vehicle division of Hyundai. Woods was in a 2021 Genesis GV80 S.U.V., which was provided to him during the tournament; he is , in a courtesy car at tournaments.,Woods stayed after the weekend to do ,, and when the crash happened, according to ESPN, he was on his way to a photo shoot with the N.F.L. quarterbacks Drew Brees and Justin Herbert.,Rory McIlroy, 31, in an ,” with Jimmy Fallon on March 9, said that he had spoken with Woods and that he expected him to be able to recover at home with his family soon.,“He’s doing better — and I think all of us are wishing him a speedy recovery at this point,” McIlroy said of himself and unspecified fellow golfers in the interview, which he did from the Players Championship.,Several PGA Tour players ,, on the final day of the Workday Championship on Feb. 28. Some used Bridgestone golf balls imprinted with Woods’s usual marking, “TIGER.” And many spectators wore red shirts, hats and masks.,“It is hard to explain how touching today was when I turned on the TV and saw all the red shirts,” a , said on Sunday. “To every golfer and every fan, you are truly helping me get through this tough time.”,Annika Sorenstam, 50, wore a red top and a black skirt at an L.P.G.A. Tour event in Orlando, Fla., while the maintenance staff at the Puerto Rican Open wore red in tribute as well.,On the day of the crash, celebrities and fans alike , on social media.,Even before the wreck, , when Woods might play again or whether he would be able to pursue a record-tying sixth Masters victory this spring.,Woods was trying to recover from ,, a microdiscectomy, which he had disclosed in January.,When he appeared on CBS on Sunday during the final round of the Genesis tournament, Woods was asked whether he would compete at the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club in April. “God, I hope so,” he said. “I’ve got to get there first.”,Although Woods said last month that he expected to miss at least two tournaments, he did not publicly rule out playing in the Masters, which he last won in 2019. On Sunday, he said he was “feeling fine, a little bit stiff,” and was awaiting another magnetic resonance imaging scan to evaluate his progress.,In the meantime, he said, he was “still doing the mundane stuff that you have to do for rehab, the little things before you can start gravitating toward something a little more.”,Woods tied for 38th place in the 2020 Masters, which was played in November because of the coronavirus pandemic. Although he shot a 10 on the 12th hole during the final round, he birdied five of the final six holes.,Reporting was contributed by ,Alan Blinder,, ,Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, and ,Bill Pennington,.",1
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/books/sanjena-sathian-gold-diggers.html,arts,"At a sleepover in sixth grade, when she admitted that she hadn’t seen the movie “Grease,” Sanjena Sathian remembers being asked if she was even American.,“I instinctively said, ‘No, I’m not,’ even though I was born here,” Sathian, now 29, said in a video interview from her home in Atlanta. That was typical for much of her life where she, like many South Asian Americans, was made to feel differently.,It took her years to overcome that sense of otherness, but by the time she was preparing for the release of her debut novel, “Gold Diggers,” she felt confident calling herself an American.,All that changed in an instant a few weeks ago, after ,, including six women of East Asian descent, were , not far from the upper middle class Atlanta suburb where she grew up. The shootings felt close to home for Sathian, both physically and ,.,“There exists this irony where it’s like, ‘Oh, we’re so accepted’ — my family went to fancy schools and my parents are doctors so, yes, that does insulate us in so many ways. And yet. Every day we’re interacting with strangers who carry a million different ideas of who we are,” she said.,“Bullies called me Apu from ‘The Simpsons,’ and when I’m speaking from a place of confidence, I can laugh about that,” Sathian added. “But when you see brutal violence, you realize those small things do add up to something, and it raises the question: What is belonging?”,That quest to fit in is one of the themes of Sathian’s genre-bending novel, which Penguin Press publishes on Tuesday. Set in the fictional Atlanta suburb of Hammond Creek, “Gold Diggers” is about two teenagers, Neil Narayan and Anita Dayal, who tussle with ambition and the American dream as they come of age in the post-9/11 years.,Neil wants to be anything but successful. “I wished everyone would give up on me,” he says at one point. “For it felt, back in Hammond Creek, that it wasn’t our job just to grow up, but to grow up in such a way that made sense of our parents’ choice to leave behind all they knew.”,Anita is, at first glance, the exact opposite. She’s the girl who aces all her classes, wears the Harvard sweatshirt and flings herself into every extracurricular activity imaginable, from volunteering at fund-raisers to joining the cross-country team. Everyone in the South Asian diaspora knows an Anita. She’s bursting with ambition and tirelessly working toward some vaguely defined notion of success.,The two characters “are sort of like the two halves of me,” Sathian said. On paper, she resembled Anita: She got good grades and strove for the Ivy Leagues (though Anita is “a lot hotter than me,” she insisted), but internally she struggled, like Neil, and often felt like she was failing to meet the heavy expectations of her family and teachers.,“It’s comical that I wore this talismanic Harvard sweatshirt and it’s comical how obsessed I was with winning debates,” she said. “But it’s also tragic that I robbed myself of an inner life and made it really painful for myself to underachieve.”,Sathian didn’t end up at Harvard but at Yale. After graduating, she wanted to find a job as a journalist but struggled to land one. She remembered calling her father to discuss the possibility of switching to a career “where it’s possible to be mediocre.”,She eventually became an India correspondent, based in Mumbai, for the Mountain View, Calif.-based digital publication Ozy. She stayed in that role for two years before returning to the United States and diving into the two-year Iowa Writers’ Workshop residency in 2017.,The novel’s plot takes a turn when Neil discovers that Anita and her mother, Anjali, have been melting stolen gold jewelry to brew an ancient alchemical potion in their basement. The potion is said to supercharge ambition, focus and performance so that the drinker can grasp success and perhaps with it Americanness; it is the silver (or gold?) bullet for the anxieties and identity crises of so many children of immigrants.,But what starts off as a small mother-daughter enterprise to help get Anita into Harvard evolves into an uncontrollable series of events that somersaults between different eras and countries — from the American Gold Rush of the 1800s to India in the 1980s to Silicon Valley in the present day. The characters eventually find that mediocrity could be a more sustainable and even radical path (“want less, and you can have everything you want,” Anita declares at one point).,“Gold Diggers” is embedded deeply in the South Asian American community, but it is also a more universal story, said Ginny Smith Younce, who edited the novel as well as Celeste Ng’s 2017 best seller, “,.”,Sathian “captures family and community, love and growing up,” Smith Younce said. “It’s a great read, full stop.”,The novel is already generating buzz. In 2019, Penguin Random House entered into a seven-way auction to purchase it, and in February, Mindy Kaling’s production company, Kaling International, , that it would be adapting “Gold Diggers” for television, with Sathian as one of the writers.,“The magical realism felt fresh to me, and I loved the way she used the genre to reveal a very human story,” Kaling, who will be the executive producer of the TV series, said in an email. “The idea of ambition, whose ambitions you’re trying to serve and its costs and benefits, is compelling.”,The adaptation is still in the early stages, and the company would need to produce a pilot before it is picked up by a distributor or streaming platform, said Jessica Kumai Scott, the president of Kaling International. No one has been cast, and the team is still experimenting with the structure and style of the show.,But for both Scott and Kaling, the book’s characters, particularly Neil, felt familiar, they said, like friends or family members they knew in real life.,The book’s release and the decision to create a TV series are happening just as current events have prompted discussions around Asian-American culture and identity, and what — or who — is considered American.,Days after the Atlanta shootings, Sathian wrote an , reflecting on the area, which over time had become what she called an “experiment in pluralism,” with Asian grocery stores and spas standing next to Pakistani-run salons and Ethiopian restaurants.,“On another day, I might have pointed to this part of the country as proof that we had arrived,” she wrote. “This week, all I can see is the fragility of our belonging.”",1
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/01/sports/hockey/sabres-losing-streak-ends.html,sports,"The Buffalo Sabres started the year seeking to ignite their offense with new acquisitions, but instead they found ignominy with a historic losing streak.,The Sabres lost 18 games in a row before slamming the brakes on their skid with a resounding 6-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Wednesday.,Those 18 losses matched those accumulated by the 2003-4 Pittsburgh Penguins, who previously had the undesirable distinction of having lost more games consecutively than any other team.,Goalie Linus Ullmark had 31 saves, and defenseman Brandon Montour blew the contest open with an empty-net goal and then a superb individual effort that gave him two short-handed scores in the span of 37 seconds as the Sabres tightened their grip on the game late.,“You never want to lose,” said Montour, who praised his team’s positive through the streak. “Especially the streak we had there, everybody was talking about it, there was always something to say.”,Injuries have played a role: Buffalo was without the scoring forward Jack Eichel, who last played on March 7, toward the middle of the slump.,Without Eichel, their captain, the Sabres sought leadership by committee, and many players were vocal on Wednesday, Don Granato, the interim coach, said. The team had squandered a three-goal lead against Philadelphia in the third period on Monday, so Granato allowed his players to speak during the second intermission rather than making strategic adjustments or offering his own thoughts.,“We thought it was best just to hand it to them,” Granato said. “It’s your third period, not ours, and you know what to do.”,What they did was end a slide that had lasted more than a month. Here are some of the highlights:,The losing streak (0-15-3), which began on Feb. 25 with an overtime loss to the Devils, was equal parts woe and “whoa,” as the Sabres were abjectly bad at times and imaginatively so at others.,The Sabres nearly broke their free fall on Monday, when they took a 3-0 lead at home against the Flyers. But the Flyers evened the score in the third period before defenseman Ivan Provorov capped Philadelphia’s comeback with a goal 42 seconds into overtime.,“We haven’t been in this situation — we got panicked,” defenseman Rasmus Dahlin said in a video news conference. “The puck bounces their way, and — I don’t know.”,Montour was even more blunt in his assessment, saying that any team in the N.H.L. should have won a game it had led by 3-0, much less a team as desperate for a victory as Buffalo.,Whether or not that was the nadir of the streak may be a matter of debate.,The Sabres closed February by being shut out in back-to-back games against Philadelphia, another of the worst defensive teams this season.,Between March 4 and March 11, the Sabres allowed five goals in each of five consecutive games, which was as close as they had come to defensive consistency.,They followed that up with two more shutout losses, falling to the to the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Washington Capitals by an aggregate score of 9-0. They were shut out five times over all and were outscored, 75-30, as they plummeted to the bottom of the league standings.,The disparities between eras make the official record-keeping and bar-stool arguments a bit messy.,Starting with the implementation of the shootout in the 2005-6 season, the N.H.L. eliminated ties. The 2003-4 Penguins, who also lost 18 in a row (0-17-1), played in the final season before shootouts, but the league had a system, as it does today, that awarded teams a point in the standings for reaching overtime even if they lost.,Technically, the N.H.L. considers overtime losses and shootout losses to be equivalent to ties for historical purposes, as any of the three results would yield a point in the standings. Furthermore, for much of the league’s history, any game that would have gone to overtime or a shootout under current rules would have instead ended in a tie, as there was no regular-season overtime period between 1942 and 1983.,In,, the longest losing streaks, at 17 regulation games, belong to the 1974-75 Washington Capitals and the 1992-93 San Jose Sharks. The Sabres’ longest string of regulation losses was nine, and the 18 straight defeats are considered a “winless streak.”,The , belongs to the Winnipeg Jets franchise, today’s Arizona Coyotes. They were the class of the World Hockey Association, as the only franchise to win three Avco Cups, but their early days in the N.H.L. were dreadful. In 1980-81, their second N.H.L. campaign, they went winless for 30 games, losing 23 and tying seven times.,But there seems to be little question that the Sabres’ slump will bring further infamy to a franchise that hasn’t made the playoffs since 2011, hasn’t won a postseason series since 2007, hasn’t made the finals since 1999 and has never won the Stanley Cup over its 50-season history.,The Sabres made an outside-the-box coaching hire before last season by selecting Ralph Krueger, who had coached the Edmonton Oilers in 2012-13 but had spent the previous five years as the chairman of an English Premier League soccer club. The team fired him on March 17, when the skid had reached a dozen losses, and made Don Granato the interim coach. Krueger had taken over a team that started strong in 2018-19 and then did so again under him in 2019-20, only to fall off as those campaigns progressed.,Before this season, they had hoped to make the most of an offense that already featured top picks turned stars like center Jack Eichel and Dahlin. They added Taylor Hall, the most sought-after forward in free agency and the 2018 most valuable player, on a one-year contract. They also traded for the veteran center Eric Staal, who led the Carolina Hurricanes to a Stanley Cup victory and scored 100 points in 2006 and experienced a resurgence with the Minnesota Wild.,The day Krueger was fired, General Manager Kevyn Adams all but heaved Hall onto the trade block. Staal was traded nine days later, with 50 percent of his remaining salary retained, in exchange for two middle-round draft picks.,No Sabre who has played in at least 15 games this season has a positive plus-minus rating, and as of Wednesday evening, the four worst ratings in the N.H.L. belonged to Buffalo players, including Dahlin’s league-worst negative 33. Staal and Hall combined for 28 points, while the production of Dahlin and another offensive-minded defenseman, Rasmus Ristolainen, has also flagged considerably.,The former all-star wingers Jeff Skinner and Kyle Okposo have combined for a meager 13 points this season, despite counting for $15 million and around 18 percent of the salary cap. Okposo has been hindered by health issues, but Skinner’s even more underwhelming performance has come two seasons after he scored 40 goals for the Sabres.,As a team, Buffalo is tied with the Anaheim Ducks and the Devils for the second-fewest goals scored and is near the bottom in goals allowed.",2

I had arrived in the holy land, which for me was a show palace in New York City, the world capital of my childhood fantasies. My very first Broadway musical, a form of entertainment I regarded as a religion, was about to begin.,Then the lights went down in the cavernous , It got dark, which I had expected. It stayed dark, which I hadn’t. The stage was flooded in shadow, and you had to squint to make out the people on it. Some were tall, spectral beauties from another era in glittering headdresses, and others were as ordinary as my parents, dressed up for a night out. None of them looked happy.,The grand orchestral music seemed to be eroding as I listened, like some magnificent sand castle dissolving in the tide, as sweet notes slid into sourness. This was definitely not , or , or , whose sunny, exclamation-pointed melodies I knew by heart from the original cast recordings.,I didn’t know what had hit me. I certainly didn’t know that it would keep hitting me, in sharp and unexpected fragments of recollection, for the next 50 years.,It was the spring of 1971. The show was“Follies,” a title that turned out to refer to both bygone Ziegfeld-style spectacles and the delusions of its main characters. It had a score by a rising composer named Stephen Sondheim and was directed by Harold Prince and Michael Bennett, names that didn’t mean much to me then. The cast included Yvonne De Carlo, Gene Nelson and the divine ,, whom I knew from old movies on television.,Since the show was still in previews, there had been no reviews to cue my expectations. And word of mouth hadn’t reached Winston-Salem, N.C., where I was a 16-year-old public high school student.,My parents had finally succumbed to my pleas to be taken to Manhattan, where my older sister lived. We were all side-by-side in orchestra seats, and I could feel my mom and dad basking in my excitement.,That excitement was tinged with a thrill of illicit betrayal. Yes, “Follies” was undeniably a big Broadway musical, staged with an opulence that would be unthinkable today. But this tale of two unhappy couples, stalked by the ghosts of their younger selves during a showbiz reunion in the ruins of a once stately theater, was telling me that the optimistic promises of the musical comedies I had been weaned on were lies.,In a cover story that came out a month later — its pictures would adorn my bedroom walls, along with posters of Humphrey Bogart and Vanessa Redgrave, until I left for college — Time magazine enthusiastically (and accurately) described “Follies” as anti-nostalgic, a modern corrective to the cheery, escapist camp of hit revivals like ,Time’s assessment was the opposite of that of the New York Times critics , and ,, who didn’t like “Follies” at all. The plot, they wrote, was hackneyed and formulaic. As for the songs, with their homages to styles of showbiz past, Barnes called them a “non-hit parade of pastiche.”,I couldn’t disagree about James Goldman’s book, which felt like a rehash of the best sellers about middle-aged disenchantment I borrowed from my parents. (I already suspected that my future was in criticism.) But the songs stuck with me, along with piercing images of aging performers clinging to a waning spotlight. And I had a vague sense that I would be destined to forever recall this odd and majestic show “like a movie in my head that plays and plays,” to borrow from its script.,In some ways, “Follies” was a perfect match to my adolescent self. My parents had always encouraged me to understand that old people hadn’t always been old, to look for the layers of what they had been. (I was fascinated by the culture of my grandparents’ generation, which meant that references to Brenda Frazier and “Abie’s Irish Rose” didn’t go over my head.),And part of what I found so affecting about musicals were the differences between their exalted forms and the often ordinary lives they portrayed. (I would restage classic musicals in my head with my friends and family in the leading roles; it made me cry happily.),What I didn’t get then — and couldn’t have as a teenager — was how the music was the very sound of memory. It was the cleverness of Sondheim’s lyrics that attracted me in my youth. I loved quoting their sophisticated rhymes.,But the older I got, and the more I listened, the more I appreciated the complexity of the pastiche songs, like “The Story of Lucy and Jessie,” “Broadway Baby” and the torchy “Losing My Mind” (which I confess to having sung, drunk, in a piano bar). These aren’t just facile imitations from another era; they’re inflected with the echoes and distortions of all the years that have passed since. As a memory musical, I came to realize, “Follies” approaches Proustian dimensions.,When I hear anything from “Follies” now — or see a new production (I’ve written about seven incarnations for The New York Times) — it’s with the memory of watching that first cast of characters remembering. Every time what I’m listening to sounds deeper and richer, and sadder and funnier. And I recall, with a tightening of my chest, that 16-year-old boy staring at the stage in rapture and bewilderment.",1

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/books/review-next-shift-health-care-gabriel-winant.html,arts,"Bad times for American labor have also meant boom times for a certain strain of American nostalgia. According to a well-worn narrative, the postwar era was an idyll of heavy industry and stable union jobs; a family with 2.5 children could get by with just one breadwinner — the archetypical working-class man, who toiled in a sooty industrial plant before coming home to a house that was impeccably maintained by his doting wife.,Decades after the collapse of its steel industry, Pittsburgh exemplifies how the trace memory of an old identity can live on in a football team (the Steelers), a nickname (Steel City) and even a local beer (Iron City), while the industry that actually flourishes there now — health care — garners no such reverence or recognition. The fastest growth in the sector isn’t for anesthetists or X-ray technicians but for poorly paid caregiving jobs; most of these care workers are women, and many of them are Black.,During the pandemic, these workers have been called “essential” — but as the historian Gabriel Winant explains in “The Next Shift,” remuneration and job protections haven’t kept up. “Care workers are at once everywhere and nowhere,” Winant writes. “They are responsible for everyone, but no one is responsible for them.”,The replacement of blue-collar work by pink-collar work has been much discussed, but what makes this book stand out is Winant’s argument that two seemingly distinct phenomena are in fact inextricably connected: “It was not a coincidence that care labor grew as industrial employment declined.” In the 1970s, deindustrialization pushed an ailing and aging population into unemployment, toward the welfare state — always tentative, in the American case — for their survival. Unlike other social institutions, which buckled under political pressure and austerity cuts, the American health care system flourished, having grown already in response to the rise of collectively bargained health insurance during the flush postwar years.,Winant traces the surprising story of how this happened, taking Pittsburgh as his focus. The city and its surrounding county offer one of the starkest examples of a local economy not simply shaped but warped by the steel industry, whose reach extended through the entire social fabric, right down to the level of family relationships. Winant, who teaches at the University of Chicago, consulted the archives, examined the data and conducted his own interviews to glean an intimate look at how a city of steel became a city of health care aides.,“The Next Shift” is an original work of serious scholarship, but it’s also vivid and readable; Winant has an eye for the telling, and occasionally crushing, detail. One ambivalent steelworker recalled that he always brought his lunch in a brown paper bag that consistently failed to protect his sandwich from hungry rats; he resisted getting a proper lunch pail like the others because it would mean that he was resigning himself to staying put. A woman remembered growing up amid the hushed silence of a house that had to be kept quiet and dark so that the father she barely saw, who worked night shifts, could get some sleep during the day. Households had to organize themselves around the needs of the industry. Each family became “a little factory.”,Despite the sentimentality that has attached to the steel mill, the work it generated was not only dangerous, it was also unpredictable and not infrequently alienating. Winant describes how a coke shoveler working night shifts lost “control over his body’s rhythms — eating, sleeping, toiling,” which in turn made it harder to maintain the performance of masculinity that was so central to his identity. Not to mention that the job security afforded by the union’s collective bargaining wasn’t evenly distributed. In the 1950s, as the demand for steel slackened with the end of the Korean War, layoffs hit Black workers first — they tended to be marginalized within the union, and kept in the worst positions at the mill.,For a time, steelworker unions obtained higher wages, outstripping inflation; then, responding to government pressure to keep wages down, they bargained for better health insurance, which generated its own inflationary dynamic in the health care system. Winant offers a lucid explanation of how the peculiarities of this system developed into what he calls the “public-private welfare state” — a dysfunctional realm of escalating health care costs and entrenched and entangled interests that no one seems capable of replacing.,This public-private welfare state was what awaited the workers cast off by a collapsing industry. Winant notes that the two social institutions that have prospered since the 1980s have been prisons and health care delivery: “Like the expansion of the prison system in the final decades of the 20th century, the rise of the health care industry afforded an economic fix to the social crisis brought about by deindustrialization.”,Hospital work was labor intensive, and it opened a job market for those Black Americans, including domestic workers, who were the first to be displaced by automation and industrial decline. Their exploitation, Winant says, “formed the basis of the bonanza for everyone else.” This work force was largely excluded from the midcentury prosperity and security it helped to create, and the ensuing cycle was vicious: “Caregiving could be offered at large volume to the insured fractions of the working class because its costs were passed on in such significant proportion to hospital employees via low wages.”,This system, as depicted in Winant’s eye-opening book, is not only inhumane but unsustainable. Toward the end of “The Next Shift,” he introduces us to Nila Payton, a medical secretary who takes calls all day from patients with mesothelioma and black lung at the pathology office where she works. The place is part of Pittsburgh’s enormous hospital complex, but her office is so understaffed that it’s sometimes hard to find someone to cover the phone when she needs to use the bathroom. She says this has damaged her bladder, and in nine years of working there she has never received more than a 15 cent raise.,“Like many patients,” Winant writes, “Payton is now in medical debt — though in her case it is to her own employer.”",0

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/arts/design/instagram-art-accounts.html,arts,"My other great cultural love, alongside visual art, is comics. I think it’s because the form combines writing and pictures, the two media to which I’ve devoted my career. Whether it's a comic or just a meme, I find it immensely satisfying and kinetic when images and words are brought together in such a way to add up to something greater than the sum of those parts.,That , is the theme of my picks this month. Each of these accounts brings text into the Instagram frame, albeit in very different ways. After years of scrolling in search of only pictures, it seems I’ve finally accepted that this social media platform has more creative possibility than I thought.,I remember picking up ,’s graphic book “Good Talk: A Memoir in Conversations” (2018) with uncertainty; I wasn’t sure what I thought about the format, which features drawn characters facing forward, usually side by side, talking to each other but never visibly emoting. I worried it might get repetitive, but in fact “Good Talk” blew me away — the book is a complex, funny and penetrating portrait of being a person of color in this country. Those same qualities (and the same format) are present in much of the work that Jacob puts on Instagram, whether it’s about the difficulties of the pandemic or last fall’s presidential election. In one powerful post from Jan. 7, she placed images of her and her son amid photographs of the Capitol riot while intoning, again and again, “This is America.”,It’s not uncommon for ,’s posts to make me tear up. Her comics tend to be devastatingly honest, capturing in just a few panels an incredible depth of feeling. In a way, that’s not surprising; as the woman formerly known as Emily Doe in the Brock Turner sexual assault case, Miller used the power of words to tell her own story in , But I’m also taken by the aesthetic of her work: Her handwritten text and purposefully scratchy drawings create a sense of rawness, as if we readers were watching her process things — mostly recently, , — in real time. Miller’s comics are borderless, and the surrounding white space gives them a floating, dreamy quality, like thoughts and images that are subject to change, just barely held in place.,About a year ago, at the beginning of the pandemic in the United States, Paul Druecke started picking up litter. It was “a way to maintain connection to a fast changing world,” he writes in his , of the project, which is titled “America Pastime.” His earliest photographs, posted on Instagram, were close-up shots of jumbles of trash that he encountered; I found them arresting and artful, in spite of their subject matter. Since then, the images have become more abstract, and Druecke also posts short texts that at times read like correspondence, other times like poetry. The combination of different elements gives “America Pastime” greater heft, making it a compelling meditation on how people relate both to each other and to our physical world.,One of my favorite uses of Instagram is as a thematic archive. Accounts like this abound, and when they’re done well — that is, thoughtfully and carefully — they feel like treasure troves of knowledge and insight. That’s the case with the Womanist Reader, the , of Bilphena Yahwon, who, after the murder of 19-year-old , last June, looked to books to make sense of what she was feeling. On Instagram, the Womanist Reader shares poems and excerpts from texts by Black women, alongside historical images and videos that give their words a fuller and more intimate context. The account is accompanied by an ,. Taken as a whole, the project honors the voices of Black women not just by broadcasting their images but, more important, by engaging with their ideas.,I’ve long complained that the art world takes itself too seriously, but maybe I should revise that now that there are several hugely popular Instagram art meme accounts. Of the most prominent three — ,, Freeze Magazine and , (which is now private, despite having nearly 89,000 followers) — it was hard to choose one for this column. But I landed on Freeze, which was founded by a Turkish-born artist named Cem A., because it makes me laugh most consistently. As we pass the year mark of the pandemic, I take refuge in the blunt, bracing humor of a crude , about ,. But it’s more than that, because when an art meme lands just right — like a , of hard truths delivered via stills from “Spider-Man” — it goes from funny to something deeper, something not too far-off from criticism, or even art, itself.",1
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/arts/design/3-art-gallery-shows-to-see-right-now.html,arts,"Through April 23. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, Manhattan; 212-570-4190, ,.,The Milanese sculptor Fausto Melotti (1901-86) remains best known for abstract, lightweight constructions of metal filaments, from which he suspended thinly pounded sheets of brass and gold. (His friend, the writer Italo Calvino, called them “a score of weightless ideograms,” and used them as an inspiration for his novel “Invisible Cities.”) New Yorkers saw many of these rather outmoded sculptures at Hauser & Wirth in 2018, and another one, comprising seven strips of brass entangled in looping wires, is on view now at Barbara Mathes Gallery in the Upper East Side, sitting over the mantelpiece. But Melotti also worked in ceramics — and as everyone from , to , is now rediscovering the importance of pottery, this artist’s colorful and crooked work in clay outshines the metal.,Melotti began making vases and vessels in the late 1920s, under the guidance of the towering architect ,, and after World War II he refurbished his bombed-out studio on Milan’s Via Leopardi with a full-size kiln. For the next 15 years he worked only in ceramics and terra-cotta. Here at Mathes are nine simple, thin-walled bowls, each less than six inches across, with extraordinary polychrome glazes: a runny, pearlescent aquamarine that tints to black, or a milky white that overlays stains of mauve and olive. Stranger and more sculptural: a vase from 1965, glazed in splotchy blues and cinched at the center like an hourglass, with a brim like a mushroom cap wrapped around its midsection.,With their delicate wobbles and impure finishes, many of Melotti’s ceramics seem to be as ancient as they are modern — and indeed postwar Italy witnessed a flowering of decorative arts, including Carlo Scarpa’s glassware and Carlo Mollino’s furniture, that gently historicized and regionalized the rigors of European modernism. The modest confidence of these vases and bowls has a particular appeal if you have been trapped inside lately, scrolling through seemingly interchangeable ceramics influencers.,JASON FARAGO,Through May 1. Institute for Studies on Latin American Art (ISLAA),50 East 78th Street, Manhattan, ,.,In 1981, four Mexican artists who went by the group name Colectivo 3 — Aarón Flores, Araceli Zúñiga, César Espinosa and Blanca Noval Vilar — put out an international call for other artists to join them in responding to the volatile political situation in Nicaragua, where the left-wing, Sandinista-led government was fighting U.S.-backed rebels. Colectivo 3’s call was for the creation of a single work of protest art composed of many individual voices. Revolution would be the theme. The form: work in any style that could fit a letter-size sheet of paper and be sent through the mail.,More than 300 artists from 43 countries took up the call, and their works make up the exhibition “Poema Colectivo Revolución” at the , on the Upper East Side, which holds all the material in its archives. The show has been organized by the distinguished Uruguayan-born conceptualist Luis Camnitzer, who has covered the walls of ISLAA’s small gallery with photocopies of the mailed art. (The original pieces, some now fragile-looking, are viewable in binders in the gallery.),Originating with Dada, mail art had a bump of popularity in the 1960s, and the 1981 project suggests both its pluses and minuses as a political medium. Its distribution through the mail made it democratic; its targeted art world audience made it elitist. Some artists took it seriously; for others it was a lark; for still others a way to do some career networking. Indeed, the project is most interesting — and very interesting — when viewed through a critical essay written by Camnitzer and available as a takeaway. In it, he hits on many of the potential strengths and weaknesses that “political art” as a category encompasses and that “Poema Colectivo Revolución” embodies. He questions the viability of the genre without dismissing it, setting out terms for a debate every bit as relevant as it was 40 years ago.,HOLLAND COTTER,Through April 24. JDJ, 17 Mandalay Drive, Garrison, N.Y.; 518-339-6913, ,.,After studying at the progressive Black Mountain College in North Carolina (and inspiring her former husband, Robert Rauschenberg, to do the same) Susan Weil returned to New York to continue a long career making a wide range of mixed-media work. Despite the intimate scale of JDJ gallery’s rustic, one-room space, this current show provides a broad look at over four decades of output by Weil, who turned 91 this month. It reveals how her sly, inventive use of the figure (especially the feminine figure) evolved and persisted over time.,Her earliest works — spray-painted abstract compositions from the 1970s — have shapes suggestive of human limbs and torsos. Canvas pieces made in the 1980s and ’90s hang from walls like strange cloaks. They conjure the body too, if more indirectly, by evoking the folds and pleats of fabric that drape around it. Two collaged grids (from 1998 and 2000) break down the dynamic movements of female nudes into a series of freeze-frame shots, reminiscent of Eadweard Muybridge’s stop-motion photography.,Not to be missed: four artist books Weil made with the publisher Vincent Fitzgerald & Co. Texts by James Joyce, Gertrude Stein and the poet Rumi appear alongside Weil’s etchings and cut-paper collages. These hand-bound volumes, issued in editions of either 25 or 50, feel like profoundly personal labors of love. When a gloved gallery attendant shows you these books, it’ll be all you can do not to reach out and flip through their pages yourself.,DAWN CHAN",0

She was 88.,The cause was pancreatic cancer, said,, her partner of 64 years and her only survivor.,Ms. Collins, who won her Tony for Herb Gardner’s ,in 1986, was the lighting designer for more than 30 other Broadway productions, among them “The Threepenny Opera,” “Ain’t Misbehavin’” and “Doubt,” which earned her a Tony nomination.,“Her lighting was like her personality: She was nervy and intelligent but with a sensitive side,” ,a Tony-winning scenic designer and frequent collaborator, said in a phone interview. “She really blossomed in tech rehearsals; she loved to create on the spot.” He added: “She could do conventional lighting, but she also wanted to try everything.”,Ms. Collins brought an autumnal palette to “I’m Not Rappaport,” about two irascible and inseparable octogenarians who meet on a Central Park bench, and the darkness of looming death to a 1989 production in Baltimore of , David Feldshuh’s play about the federal government’s withholding of treatment for syphilis to poor Black men. In a 2002 revival of Lanford Wilson’s “Burn This” at the Union Square Theater, she transformed figures onstage into what ,“ambiguous silhouettes.”,She also worked at regional theaters throughout the United States and with opera companies in New York, San Francisco, Santa Fe, London, Paris and Munich — always , to establish moods, create the illusion of time passing and indicate where the audience’s attention should be on the stage.,“Lighting has everything to do with how you feel and how things affect you,” Ms. Collins told The Post-Star in Glens Falls, N.Y., in 1975. “Almost everyone has had the aesthetic experience of being moved by seeing light filtered through trees in the forest. Multiply that by one thousand and you’d have some idea of the constant subliminal effect lighting has on us.”,a lighting designer who worked with Ms. Collins on two productions at the Alaska Repertory Theater in the 1980s, said of her: “She understood the point of the show and made sure that you saw it. Whether it was portentous events in ‘An Enemy of the People’ or the sheer fun of ‘Ain’t Misbehavin’,’ her light reflected and communicated that.”,Mr. Chybowski recalled the lighting design that Ms. Collins devised for “An Enemy of the People,” Ibsen’s political drama about a scientist who tries to save his town from water pollution but becomes a scapegoat.,“She went into the studio, worked at my drafting table for four hours, drew up the plan and went off to the airport,” he said. “I said, ‘It can’t be that easy,’ but we put on the show, and it was the most beautiful show we did in my five years at the theater.”,Patricia Jane Collins was born on April 3, 1932, in Brooklyn to Jerry and Alta (Hyatt) Collins. Her mother worked in a law firm; her father left the family when Pat was very young.,Ms. Collins attended Pembroke College in Brown University, where she studied Spanish and joined a campus drama group. After graduating, she spent a year at Yale Drama School — where she met Dr. Stuermer — but felt it was a waste of time. She went to work instead as a stage manager at the Joffrey Ballet, and then as an assistant to , a top Broadway lighting designer, at the American Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, Conn.,Ms. Collins worked as a stage manager, among other jobs, in the 1960s but did not hit her stride until Joseph Papp, the founder and director of the New York Shakespeare Festival, hired her to design the lighting for productions of ,, which earned her a Tony nomination, and at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park in 1977.,“She had fixed somebody else’s show, and he offered her ‘Threepenny,’” said ,, a lighting designer and longtime associate of Ms. Collins’s. “That put her on the map, and she never stopped working after that.”,For all that she worked on Broadway, she spent much of her time away from it, designing lighting at regional theaters, including Ford’s Theater in Washington, Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago, Berkeley Repertory Theater in California, the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles and the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, Conn.,For the Hartford Stage Company’s production of Shakespeare’s “Cymbeline,” , wrote admiringly of “the ever-changing light patterns” that Ms. Collins had created with “mirror images and stars and moons and comets.”,Ms. Collins, who began listening to opera on radio at age 9, designed lighting for productions at the Metropolitan Opera, the Royal Opera House in London and the Bavarian State Opera in Munich.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/business/economy/biden-tax-plan.html,business,"President Biden’s ambitious plan to increase corporate taxes does more than just reverse much of the overhaul pushed through by his predecessor. It also offers a profoundly different vision of how to make the United States more competitive and how to foot the bill.,When President Donald J. Trump and a Republican Congress ,, most of the benefits went to the wealthiest Americans, with lower rates on businesses and on profits from investments. The guiding principle, proponents argued, was that cutting taxes on corporations and investors would encourage businesses to expand, creating more jobs and generating more wealth for everyone.,By contrast, the animating idea behind the tax plan put forward by the Biden administration on Wednesday is that the best way to increase America’s competitiveness and foster economic growth is to raise corporate taxes to finance huge investments in transportation, broadband, utilities and more.,The Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers all welcomed the idea of pumping money into repairing and building the nation’s infrastructure, but recoiled at raising corporate taxes to do so.,“We strongly oppose the general tax increases proposed by the administration, which will slow the economic recovery and make the U.S. less competitive globally — the exact opposite of the goals of the infrastructure plan,” the chamber’s chief policy officer, Neil Bradley, ,.,The biggest and most eye-catching proposal is to trim the sizable reduction in the corporate tax rate enacted under Mr. Trump. In 2017, Republicans shrank the rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Mr. Biden wants to nudge the rate part of the way back — to 28 percent.,The increase will “ensure that corporations pay their fair share of taxes,” and fund critical investments “to maintain the competitiveness of the United States and grow the economy,” the White House stated in outlining the plan.,The other provisions are primarily intended to ensure that multinational corporations cannot avoid taxes on profits generated overseas. The hope is that this will reduce the temptation to set up operations or offices in foreign tax havens.,The plan, which still lacks detailed provisions, is “both an undoing and a pushing in new directions,” said Mihir A. Desai, an economist at Harvard Business School. “The more novel aspects relate to how it changes the way we think about foreign operations and global income.”,Through a series of complex and arcane provisions, the Biden administration would essentially treat profits earned abroad more like those earned at home — raising rates and requiring that taxes be paid on time rather than pushed far into the future. It would also establish what would in effect be a minimum tax on foreign income.,The proposals hew closely to what Mr. Biden promised on the campaign trail, and the immediate reactions mostly fell along predictable lines. Republicans, business groups and conservative economists said they worried that the rate increases would discourage investment. Progressive groups and liberal economists hailed the announcement, saying it would fix some glaring loopholes., since the presidential election and has hoped that gridlock in Washington would moderate Mr. Biden’s agenda. On Wednesday, a spokesman for JPMorgan Chase said the bank’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, believed that “the corporate tax rate for companies in the U.S. has to be competitive globally, which it is now.”,Supporters countered that the changes would do much more to promote growth and go a long way in curbing excesses of the 2017 tax legislation. Democrats have argued that the low-tax approach has failed to deliver broad economic gains, with only those at the very top benefiting. Targeted government spending on workers, students and infrastructure, they argue, would offer much more bang for the buck. What’s more, businesses base their decisions on a range of factors besides tax rates.,Even economists favoring low rates on business acknowledge that the 2017 tax cuts did not produce much of an increase in investment. Gross domestic product grew at a rate of , in the two years leading up to the law and 2.4 percent in the two years after it passed.,“There’s essentially no evidence that the tax change boosted investment,” said William Gale, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. He argued that investment went up in 2018 only because oil prices rose. And while the tax law favored investments in equipment and structures, it turned out that the biggest investments were not in those areas but in intellectual capital.,Supporters also argue that the proposed changes are much fairer.,“The cut in the rate was overdue but may well have been overdone,” Mr. Gale said of the Trump tax cuts. “It gave massive windfall gains to corporations,” rewarding them for investment decisions made in the past instead of providing new incentives to plow money back into their businesses, he said.,Debates about the tax code are really debates about who should bear the burden of paying for what society deems important — highways and bridges, clean water and high-speed broadband, basic research and development.,By shifting the tax burden, the Biden administration is saying corporations — among the biggest winners the last time around — should pick up more of the tab this time.,“We have pressing infrastructure needs, and the fairest way to fund those is to claw back some of the giveaways” to corporations and shareholders contained in the 2017 law, said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.,Mr. Rosenthal also pointed out that a large chunk of the increased tax payments would fall on foreigners, who own 40 percent of stocks.,The advertised tax rate — whether on corporations or individuals — is often much higher than what many actually pay.,The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which has long criticized American businesses for managing to avoid paying what they owe, conducted a study of Fortune 500 companies that were profitable and that provided enough information to calculate effective tax rates. The institute found that those companies on average paid ,income.,And 91 of those companies, including Amazon, Chevron, Halliburton and IBM, paid no federal income tax that year.,Existing exemptions and deductions are not evenly distributed. Industrial machinery, gas, oil, electric and chemical companies tend to have the lowest effective rates, often less than 5 percent.,Economists have debated who actually bears the cost of higher corporate taxes — shareholders and owners or workers. Research by the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department and the Brookings Institution has concluded that those who own the business generally pay about three-quarters of a tax increase, with workers picking up the rest.,Mr. Desai at Harvard applauded the infrastructure investment but was put off by the impact of the tax increase on workers. “In a populist moment, it’s good politics but bad economics,” he said. He would prefer taxing individuals’ capital income. He also pointed out that the laserlike focus on corporations — as opposed to other businesses that may be organized differently — tended to penalize large successful companies.,It is still unclear how much would be paid by other groups favored by the current tax code, including the richest Americans and businesses that ,.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/football/nfl-17-games-records.html,sports,"We come to praise the 16-game N.F.L. schedule, but also to bury it.,The 16-game regular season was the Platonic ideal of professional sports scheduling for 43 years, in part because the number 16 itself is a neatly divisible, perfect square of almost fearful symmetry. Each team’s schedule could be easily subdivided into even numbers of divisional games and interconference matchups. With the addition of a bye week in 1990, the 16-game schedule occupied almost precisely one-third of the calendar year, making football season feel comprehensive yet brisk and intense, unlike the sprawling 82-game N.B.A. and N.H.L. seasons that nearly overlap themselves.,Unfortunately, the 16-game schedule is going the way of the leather helmet. The N.F.L. formally announced Tuesday that its regular season would expand to 17 games, rubber stamping a move ,. Farewell, even numbers and familiar statistical benchmarks! Say hello instead to Super Bowls that take place on Presidents’ Day weekend and mediocre playoff teams that boast winning percentages of 52.941176.,The expanded schedule means expanded revenues for the league, of course. The new 17-game season dovetails with the recently announced , with broadcasters and streaming services that take effect in 2023.,But the N.F.L. is not merely adding a week of games. The league is evolving so it can become an even larger part of a changing culture and multimedia ecosystem, just as it was doing when it expanded the regular season from 14 games to 16 in 1978.,That year, the N.F.L. did much more than add two games to its schedule. It introduced wild card teams so it could add an additional round to the playoffs. League owners also enacted sweeping rule changes designed to increase passing and scoring, which would become something of a habit for them over the next four decades. The new rules permitted blockers to open their hands to push defenders without incurring holding penalties and prohibited defenders from dragging wide receivers around the field behind motorcycles. (More precisely, the rampant and often vicious downfield contact that made defenses like , so effective became illegal.),As a result of relaxed rules and the 14 percent longer schedule, pre-1978 statistics looked quaint just a few seasons later. The All-Pro Miami Dolphins quarterback Bob Griese threw for 2,252 yards and led the league with 22 touchdowns in 1977. By 1984, Dan Marino shattered existing records with 5,084 yards and 48 touchdowns while playing beside some of Griese’s former teammates.,Before the arrival of the 16-game schedule, the N.F.L. preseason lasted six grueling weeks. The regular season did not begin until the third week of September and ended in mid-December, followed by two short weeks of playoffs. Even Super Bowls were held on Sunday afternoons, as if they were just another game, until the end of the 1977 season. Starting in 1978, the regular season and playoffs essentially took their modern footprints and culminated in a prime-time television spectacular.,Pro football’s changes were so pronounced and swift that the advent of the 16-game season looks in retrospect like Dorothy’s arrival in Oz. The game’s history before 1978 is sepia-toned, with fans in parkas and fedoras huddled on icy bleachers watching grizzled, hung over quarterbacks who smoked cigarettes during pregame warm-ups (as John Facenda narrated the scene). Everything after 1978 is in vivid color, faster-paced and poised for the era of cable television, satellite packages, video games and fantasy sports.,The 16-game schedule provided a durable framework as the N.F.L. expanded from 28 to 32 teams and six to eight divisions, increased the number of playoff participants from 10 to (as of last year) 14, added bye weeks, introduced Sunday and Thursday night television packages and conditioned football fans to watch live coverage of off-season events like the draft and scouting combine. The schedule was so well-structured in later years that fans knew which opponents their favorite team would face next season the moment the previous one ended. Yet droves of fans tuned in to watch schedule announcement shows anyway.,The new 17-game schedule arrives at another time of rapid change. The N.F.L. has long embraced fantasy football and is now welcoming legalized gambling partnerships. Media rights have been awarded to streaming services in addition to traditional TV broadcasters, and the league is expected to use some of the extra games to expand its international presence. Just as it ditched bell-bottoms and abandoned midcentury trappings in 1978, the N.F.L. in 2021 is putting away its cargo pants, downloading TikTok and getting ready to appeal to ,.,Traditionalists howled in the first years after the N.F.L.’s 16-game expansion, when old records were easily eclipsed and men with nicknames like “,” and “,” ceded the stage to golden boys like Joe Montana. Purists will also fret in the weeks and months to come about a supposedly diluted product with too many games and playoff teams.,Come winter, those same naysayers will surely end up rushing to finalize their fantasy lineups before plopping on a bar stool or sofa for that extra week of games. Within a few years, we will all grow accustomed to wild card teams with 9-8 records, commonplace 5,000-yard passing seasons and play-by-play announcers on 5K-resolution broadcasts updating the point spread after halftime. The 16-game era will then feel grainy and fusty by comparison.,On a related note, the N.F.L. also shortened its preseason by one game. No one will complain about that change.",2

Stanton was happy and healthy then, crushing home run after home run while , of the American League Championship Series.,“My gosh, I mean the home runs he was hitting weren’t just home runs but light-tower home runs,” Yankees first baseman Luke Voit said, adding: “The only problem is that I hit behind him and when he hits those balls so far, I’m like, ‘All right, I’ve got to do the same thing.’ And I ended up striking out.”,Stanton has not always looked or felt that good since the Miami Marlins offloaded him and his huge contract onto the Yankees after his award-winning 2017 season. Because of ,, Stanton, one of the fittest and strongest players in baseball, has appeared in roughly half of his team’s games since his move to New York. And when he was in the lineup during past postseasons, he ,, either.,That changed last season, as did his leadership role within the team on important social issues. And now, fresh off that big October, he is looking for an even bigger year.,“He looks great,” Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner said after watching Stanton one day this spring. “He looks like he hasn’t really skipped a beat from what I remember him being last October.”,The Yankees — a favorite to contend for the World Series title, a crown that has eluded them since 2009 — have many stars. There is pitcher ,, the ace who will start opening day on Thursday against the Toronto Blue Jays. There is ,, the Yankees’ best all-around player and the , last season. And there are outfielder Aaron Judge, closer Aroldis Chapman, shortstop Gleyber Torres and others.,“Our success is tied to some of our big boys really thriving,” Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said recently.,There are few bigger boys in baseball than Stanton, 31, a designated hitter listed at 6-foot-6 and 245 pounds, and the only current Yankees player with a Most Valuable Player Award on his résumé. In the past, Stanton’s size has sometimes worked against him. Since hitting 38 home runs and driving in 100 runs in 158 games of his first regular season with the Yankees, in 2018, Stanton has played in only 41 regular-season games. His list of physical ailments since is long: a biceps strain, a balky shoulder, ,, a sprained knee, a strained quadriceps and a pulled hamstring.,“It hasn’t been fun,” Stanton said recently. He knows people inside baseball and out question his durability, just as he knows the only way to dump that label is to play. “You got to be out there on the field,” he said, “if you don’t want questions.”,So after an injury-marred 2019 season, Stanton said he had lost roughly 20 pounds — an attempt to return to the weight of his healthier, most productive years. But that didn’t do the trick: Stanton was limited, again, appearing in only 23 of the Yankees’ 60 games in the truncated 2020 regular season., He significantly altered his workout regimen this winter and lifted weights less often, the Yankees’ director of player health and performance, Eric Cressey, told ,. The result, Stanton said, has been improved agility and, he hopes, better odds of staying on the field.,Stanton’s father, Mike, said that the injuries had been the low points of his son’s career, which has included four All-Star selections and 312 career home runs. “He wants nothing more than to be out there contributing,” Mike Stanton said in a phone interview this week.,Even while on the injured list last year, Stanton contributed in valuable ways. As , that was consuming the nation reached into Major League Baseball clubhouses, Stanton, one of the quieter players on the Yankees, stood front and center during several team meetings on the subject, teammates and team officials said.,He shared stories about his experience as a biracial man in America, spoke about growing up in Los Angeles mere blocks from where Rodney King was beaten by the police in 1991, and made clear his thoughts about what needed to change. In a sport with relatively few Black American players, Stanton was also one of the few people who regularly knelt during the national anthem.,“It was cool that he was speaking out, because there are people in that room that have never experienced anything like others have,” said Yankees outfielder Clint Frazier, who is white.,“And when he was speaking out and he was talking about things that he had experienced, and others were talking about it, it really pulls at your heartstrings. And it made you realize the way that these guys compartmentalize some of the things that happened in their everyday life versus what’s happening at the field.”,Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said in a phone interview that Stanton’s physical strength had always been apparent. But as protests and difficult discussions about race swept the country, Cashman added, Stanton “rose to the occasion, and that inner strength showed up from Day 1.”,“It needed to be done,” Stanton said.,Stanton, whose , were African-American and Puerto Rican, said what he saw in the country last year reminded him of what his grandmother and mother used to tell him that they experienced. While speaking up, Stanton said, he simply wanted the people around him to learn more about the issues.,He said he cared little if his words and actions led others to label him a team leader or not, and this winter he made clear he planned to stay a Yankee by passing up the opportunity to exercise the opt-out clause in his contract, which has seven years and a guaranteed $218 million remaining.,Given his injury history, it would be tough for Stanton to top that guaranteed money as a free agent, and he has emphasized that he wants to win a World Series with the Yankees. Stanton now hopes that, at least for the next eight months, his body will cooperate.,Boone has predicted “a huge season” for Stanton if the Yankees can help him stay on the field. A reason for his bullishness: Boone argued that Stanton was a better hitter now than he was in his M.V.P. season, in 2017, when he smashed 59 home runs and drove in 132 runs.,Stanton concurred, citing his improved approach at the plate (his walk rate was up the past two seasons). He said he had done eye training over the years. Last October, he tied a Yankees record with six home runs in a single postseason.,“When he’s healthy, he is one of the best players in the game,” Cashman said. “That has never been in dispute. And if anybody had questions to whether he could be the same type of player when healthy in the postseason, he showed that as well last year.”,The key for Stanton will be showing it during a marathon baseball season. There are hints that will be possible. During a recent batting practice in Florida, Stanton and Judge were back to clobbering balls over the fence. As he left the cage, Frazier sidled up to Stanton and asked, “Don’t you feel like you should be on a field that’s bigger than the one that you’re on right now?”,Stanton agreed. The Yankees will be happy simply to have him on the field.",2
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/ncaabasketball/ncaa-womens-tournament-inequity.html,sports,"Top coaches in women’s college basketball pressed N.C.A.A. executives directly on Wednesday over what they have judged as chronic failures to promote and support the sport — longstanding tensions that have now ignited a public furor over ,.,“We’re going to miss a huge window if we don’t change things now, if we don’t really step up to the plate at the N.C.A.A. as a whole to really water this sport, to really give it the attention that it deserves,” Nell Fortner of Georgia Tech told N.C.A.A. President Mark Emmert as coaches who have spent years leading teams through deep postseason runs watched.,The roughly 70-minute videoconference, which the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association organized and The New York Times viewed, came as the N.C.A.A. has struggled to move past criticism of its management of women’s basketball, which has grown into a greater force in college athletics. The unequal facilities at this year’s men’s and women’s competitions, coaches and executives alike have acknowledged, are only symptoms of deeper concerns about gender equity and whether the N.C.A.A. has unfairly prioritized the hugely profitable men’s tournament over the money-losing women’s competition.,Emmert told the coaches that the association recognized it had “some serious work to do” around women’s basketball and that “there’s no question that we dropped the ball, that we had some serious misses” around the 2021 women’s tournament, which will culminate Sunday night with the championship game in San Antonio.,“We’ve got to make sure that when we have our championships around our two marquee sports — the sports that more people watch than anything else — that we put on display the kind of equity that we all aspire to, and we sure as heck didn’t do that this year,” Emmert said.,College sports officials have said that the coronavirus pandemic posed , for this year’s tournaments. But some of women’s basketball’s leading figures used Wednesday’s meeting to argue bluntly to top officials that the very structure of the N.C.A.A. — like its organization chart and , — had contributed to long-term inequities.,The vice president of women’s basketball, for example, is not a member of Emmert’s senior management team; the association’s vice president of basketball, whose attention is largely directed toward the men’s tournament, is.,Dan Gavitt, the vice president of basketball, also acknowledged Wednesday that a dozen employees are dedicated to the men’s tournament, on which the N.C.A.A. is financially dependent, while six are focused on the women’s competition.,“As leaders, I think we have to bear the responsibility for anything that goes wrong in our organization,” Muffet McGraw, who won two national titles at Notre Dame before her retirement last year, told Emmert. “In the gender equity policy that you have, it appears that you have violated your own guidelines in what has happened in San Antonio with regard to the disparity between us and the men. However, it’s not just San Antonio — this is way deeper than that.”,Other coaches soon ticked through their own worries.,Geno Auriemma, Connecticut’s coach, warned that the university chancellors and presidents who have enormous influence over the N.C.A.A. and will play crucial roles in approving meaningful reforms “bring their biases from their own campuses.”,Dawn Staley of South Carolina challenged Emmert’s decision to , instead of appointing a group that might be more independent.,U.C.L.A.’s Cori Close questioned why the association distributes money to conferences based on performances in the men’s tournament but not the women’s, and Fortner wondered why the N.C.A.A. had not made more use of its financial and marketing might to support the women’s game.,Fortner noted, for instance, that the men’s tournament had courts that amounted to “eye candy” for casual television viewers, potentially drawing them in as they toggled through channels, while many of the women’s games were played on floors that did little to suggest the gravity of the competition.,“If you were flipping through the TV to find the women’s tournament, you would not have stayed on the game,” she said, “because you might have thought it was a high school game.”,But during his exchanges with Fortner on Wednesday, Emmert suggested that N.C.A.A. officials were contemplating expanding the use of its March Madness brand, which is synonymous with men’s basketball, to include the women’s tournament.,“Why isn’t March Madness just plastered everywhere at the women’s N.C.A.A. tournament?” Fortner asked. “It’s not on our floors. It’s not anywhere, and I wonder why. Why not?”,“I think it should be,” Emmert replied. “I want to get to the answer to that question because the truth is, I don’t know.”,Gavitt acknowledged that ESPN, which broadcasts the women’s tournament, would have a voice in the deliberations about how to promote the tournament: “If ESPN is not going to embrace using March Madness in everything they do, is it enhancing the championship to the level that we all think it can? If they will, then I think it’s a great opportunity.”,ESPN declined to comment on Wednesday, but it would likely use whatever branding that the N.C.A.A. chose.,Emmert and the other executives offered little in the way of detailed guarantees to the coaches. Instead, they largely acknowledged concerns, pledged unspecified reforms and insisted that the N.C.A.A. had not deliberately diminished women’s basketball.,“I do believe and have believed all along that women’s basketball and women’s sports is and can be a very powerful social and economic driver,” said Lynn Holzman, a former Kansas State player who is now the vice president of women’s basketball and reports to Gavitt. “Just look at the attention it’s garnered over the last week or so.”,Indeed, the N.C.A.A. has seen its tournaments sometimes overshadowed by the management turmoil around the women’s competition. Wednesday’s apologies were only the latest expressions of regret, especially concerning workout facilities that were flimsily stocked for the women’s tournament in Texas and well-supplied for the men’s event in Indiana.,N.C.A.A. officials had hoped that the outrage surrounding the tournaments would ebb, especially as the competitions advanced to their later rounds. But that seemed to reflect a misjudgment of the frustrations coursing through women’s basketball and, for that matter, the wider college sports industry.,Less than 24 hours before the meeting with Emmert, Danielle Donehew, the executive director of the group that convened Wednesday’s call, released a video that challenged the association’s plan to investigate what had happened, much as Staley did on Wednesday.,“We will remain diligent in ensuring that the voice of our member coaches are heard and the best interests of our sport are protected as this much-needed review, whatever form it may ultimately take, begins,” Donehew said.,If the law firm’s review proceeds according to the N.C.A.A.’s timetable, a report is supposed to be made public this summer.",2
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/sports/baseball/francisco-lindor-mets.html,sports,"In six seasons with Cleveland, Francisco Lindor showcased a multifaceted set of skills that, packaged underneath an irrepressible passion and an enchanting smile, combined to make him one of the most exciting, charismatic and winning players in baseball.,Beginning Thursday, Lindor will put that total package on display for the Mets, with a chance to do something even more profound. Given his age, talent and apparent dedication to the sport, and provided he eventually signs with the club long term, Lindor, 27, has a chance to become the best all-around position player the Mets have ever had.,“He could exceed them all,” said Bobby Valentine, who since 1977 has played, coached, managed and been a television analyst for the Mets. “His toolbox has the best set of tools, I think, of anyone who has ever played for the Mets.”,Mike Piazza hit the ball farther and had a better batting average, but was not a top-notch defender or runner. Carlos Beltran was the best free-agent signing in franchise history, but he broke down some after his first four years with the team. Darryl Strawberry hit the ball to the moon, and had the speed to steal bases, but he was less consistent at the plate and could not match Lindor’s defense.,Jose Reyes had the speed and the smile, David Wright put up some top-tier years and Keith Hernandez had an undeniable all-around impact on the 1986 championship team.,But Lindor, whom the Mets acquired in a blockbuster trade in January, can compete with any of them in terms of substance and style. A switch-hitter, he hits for power from both sides of the plate and racks up runs. He is an excellent defensive shortstop. He uses his speed and know-how on the basepaths, regularly showing he can score from first base on a ball into the gap, grab an extra base or steal one when necessary — and he does it all with a captivating flair under a flash of sometimes multicolored hair.,Ron Darling, the former Mets pitcher turned broadcaster, said Hernandez was the best he ever played with. Hernandez’s rare combination of offensive and defensive skills, plus his unparalleled knowledge of the game, instincts, performance in clutch situations and his standing as an admired teammate, made Hernandez stand apart.,“Lindor has those qualities,” said Darling, who has watched Lindor play since he first came to the big leagues in 2015. “He has to stick around and do it, but there is the opportunity for Lindor to one day go into the Hall of Fame in a Mets hat. That could happen, that’s how good he is.”,The statistics already shimmer on Lindor’s Baseball Reference page, tantalizing Mets fans who see him as the foundation of the future, as long as the Mets can sign him to a contract extension, either now or at the end of the season. Negotiations have been ongoing during spring training, but the player and team are reportedly separated by tens of millions of dollars, and Lindor has said he will end talks once the season starts. That would make him a free agent after the season, at which point he could re-sign with the Mets or join another team.,The market for Lindor would be robust.,He hit at least 32 home runs and 40 doubles in each of the three seasons before the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, and he scored at least 99 runs in each of his last four full seasons, leading both leagues with 129 runs scored in 2018. He has a career .285 batting average and an .833 on-base plus slugging percentage. Over the last four seasons, he has the most home runs (111) and extra-base hits (258) among shortstops.,He is also one of baseball’s defensive wizards. Lindor won the Gold Glove Award for American League shortstops in 2016 and 2019. According to FanGraphs, he has placed in the top six among shortstops in ultimate zone rating — a metric that measures a player’s overall defensive contribution — in each of the last five seasons. Last year, he was No. 1. And for traditionalists who appreciate the sure-handedness indicated by fielding percentage, Lindor’s acrobatics haven’t stopped him from putting together a mark of .981, which is fourth among active shortstops and the 11th highest ever.,What current or former Mets player can boast that combination of speed, skill, power and defense? Surely, only a handful. If any.,There is no way to definitively quantify a subjective discussion on the best Mets position player ever. But if wins above replacement — an aggregation of statistical data that attempts to measure all of a player’s skills while adjusting for park and era — is considered a rough benchmark, then Lindor stacks up very well.,He joins the Mets with a cumulative WAR of 28.8, according to Baseball Reference. Averaging 4.8 wins a year is impressive, but Lindor’s numbers would undoubtedly be stronger if not for last year’s shortened schedule, which cost him up to 102 games. In the five previous seasons, he had averaged 5.52 WAR per year, with a high of 7.8 in 2018. While those numbers would eventually decline, as they do for any aging player, the Mets could reasonably expect to see several years of Lindor’s prime should he stay with the team beyond 2021.,If those prime years can match, or exceed, his top years in Cleveland, Lindor could stand out above numerous Mets greats.,Strawberry played eight seasons with the Mets and averaged 4.58 WAR per season. Beltran’s average with the Mets was 4.44 and Piazza’s was 3.08.,Reyes, the player who could serve as a yardstick for Lindor as a speedy, switch-hitting shortstop with a joyful approach to the game, had an average WAR of 3.1 during his original nine-year stint with the team. Wright’s average WAR was 3.51.,Strawberry, Piazza, Beltran, Reyes and Wright were all great Mets position players, and others like Gary Carter, Howard Johnson and Edgardo Alfonzo had sensational stretches. But Howie Rose, who may have seen more Mets games than anyone, agrees with Darling that Hernandez may have the strongest claim as the best all-around Met ever.,Now the team’s radio play-by-play announcer, Rose attended his first Mets game at the Polo Grounds on July 6, 1962 — their inaugural season — and his Mets broadcasting career goes back to 1987. He said Hernandez’s impact with the team cannot be overstated.,Hernandez batted over .300 in his first four seasons with the Mets, had an on-base percentage over .400 three times, was among the top 10 in voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award three times and won five Gold Gloves at first base.,“His glove said Rawlings on it, but it might just as easily have said Stradivarius,” Rose said, referring to the world-class violins. “He didn’t just play the position, he performed it, and he was also an excellent hitter.”,Hernandez had an average WAR of 3.8 during his seven years with the Mets, but Rose pointed out that metric could never account for Hernandez’s unmistakable leadership qualities.,Rose said Lindor has the talent to match Hernandez (more power, but perhaps less virtuosity in the field) and is eager to see whether Lindor, who has an active role in the players’ union, assumes a leadership role with the Mets, too.,“This group gets along, they have fun together and they have a certain dynamic that any incoming player has to a little be circumspect about as they wade through it,” Rose said. “Lindor doesn’t appear to be particularly circumspect. His smile announces his arrival, and his ability certifies his standing. As far as adopting a leadership role, that’s a delicate thing. But it seems to come to him naturally.”,But not all the comparisons for incoming stars are favorable, and Lindor is not the first player to arrive in Flushing via Cleveland with an overflowing résumé. Roberto Alomar showed up with similar hope in 2002.,At the time the Mets acquired Alomar from Cleveland in 2001, he had an average yearly WAR of 4.81, just a tick better than Lindor’s, but he proceeded to have two terrible seasons in Queens. A notable difference between the two is that Alomar, who was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2011, was 34 during his first season with the Mets, seven years older than Lindor is now.,“They are getting him at a great age,” Rose said of Lindor. “Assuming he re-signs, we’re going to see what should be the best of Francisco Lindor.”,Jim Duquette, an analyst on MLB Network Radio, was an assistant general manager for the Mets at the time of the Alomar trade. He noted something else in Lindor’s favor.,“Some guys you can almost bet they are made for New York, and I think Lindor is one of those types,” Duquette said. “The guys that play with a lot of energy tend to thrive in New York, and I think there is another gear in there for Lindor.”,Piazza, who flourished in New York during his Hall of Fame career, noted during spring training that Lindor has the temperament to not only succeed in the city, but to excel under its gleaming spotlight.,“I think he’s got it,” Piazza said. “He has to go out and prove it, of course. But he seems like a really cool guy. He’s got colored hair, that’s for sure. I like it.”,Lindor also craves time on the field, missing only 30 of a possible 708 games over the last five seasons. Ross Atkins, the general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays, was the director of player development when Cleveland drafted Lindor from Montverde Academy in Florida. Atkins noted a lesser-known reason for Lindor’s success and durability.,“One thing some people don’t realize about Francisco is how strong he is and how physical,” Atkins said. “He’s not the tallest guy, but he is one of the strongest players in the game. And it’s not just that he can move weight around. It’s the way he deploys that strength. He’s one of the better professional athletes in the world.”,With or without a long-term contract extension, the experiment begins on Thursday, when Mets fans will begin to gauge whether Lindor collapses like Alomar, Jason Bay, Mo Vaughn and Kaz Matsui, becomes a one-year wonder and leaves in 2022, or slots in among the greatest Mets position players ever.,“I was always attracted to how much he loves to play,” Darling said of Lindor. “He can’t get enough of it, and boy, you love your superstar to be that kind of player. He still has to go out and do it, but in terms of pure talent, he has a chance to be the best.”",2
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/arts/television/review-made-for-love.html,arts,"Cristin Milioti has claimed a curiously specific character niche: woman escaping from twisted sci-fi trap. In the “Black Mirror” episode , she was programmed into a simulation by her creepy boss. In last year’s , she and Andy Samberg puzzled out how to break free of a time loop that stuck them in a vicious “Groundhog Day” rom-com cycle.,In “Made for Love,” a light-handed and dark-minded comedy of technology, control and gaslighting whose first three episodes arrive Thursday on HBO Max, the snare is all in her head.,As in physically. As in implanted. As in a microchip.,Hazel Green (Milioti) received this unwanted hardware upgrade from her husband, Byron Gogol (Billy Magnussen), who runs a world-dominating tech company. (Feel free to play around with the first vowel sound in “Gogol.”) For 10 years, they’ve lived in a gilded cage — or rather a gilded cube, a virtual-reality environment called the Hub, secluded from the messy outside world, with eternally perfect weather and a dolphin sporting in the swimming pool.,And for 10 years, Byron has grown more devoted. Too devoted. “Have your wife review her biometrically recorded orgasms to better optimize them” devoted. Finally, he decides that he loves her — and his technology — so deeply that he and she will become “Users One” of his new product, Made for Love, which makes couples into two-person neural networks, their brains digitally connected. No more secrets, no more miscommunication, no more private thoughts.,Who the hell would want that? you might ask, a question “Made for Love” raises but doesn’t entirely answer. For the purposes of the story, what’s important is that Byron wants it and Hazel emphatically does not. This impels her to fly the cube, a madcap and violent escape with Byron watching from behind her eyeballs. (Turns out he implanted only her chip, not his: “I had to read your diary first to know if I could let you read mine.”),Based on the , by Alissa Nutting, a writer and producer on the series, “Made for Love” plays out as a screwball action satire, which likely makes its chilling premise — patriarchy and techno-utopianism as two sides of the same chip — go down easier than it would as a straight drama. (Christina Lee of the mordant , is the showrunner; other producers include Patrick Somerville of Netflix’s , with which this shares a skeevy-dystopian vibe.),The metaphors are never far under the surface here, like Byron and Hazel’s double-finger wedding bands, reminiscent of tiny handcuffs. And when Hazel seeks help from her widowed father, Herb (Ray Romano), she finds him having taken up a committed partnership with a sex doll — sorry, “synthetic partner” — named Diane. Their one-way relationship is an echo of what Byron is trying to make Hazel into, a wife machine, but it’s also oddly tender and respectful.,“Made for Love” is hardly subtle, and its cautionary tech tale has been told repeatedly in “Black Mirror” and elsewhere. But it’s playful and funny and almost momentum-driven enough to get away with hand-waving away its many implausibilities. Among those is the question of why Hazel, presented as a wily, resourceful skeptic, would have been swept off her feet by Byron, who from their first meeting throws up enough red flags for a giant slalom course.,The casting helps put this over. Milioti, with her charm and anime eyes, is an almost too-perfect rom-com-lead type. (She , as the title figure in “How I Met Your Mother.”) But she smartly , in stories that subvert expectations. Her Hazel is cunning, feral and sardonic on the lam; in flashbacks to her married life in the Hub, you can almost hear her scream behind her 10,000-watt smile.,Romano, meanwhile, may be one of the few actors you could introduce in bed with a humanoid sex toy, whom he dresses in his dead wife’s clothing, yet have your viewer think, “You know, this seems like a complicated guy who’s been through a few rough patches.”,And Magnussen, given the broadest of the central roles, pushes Byron’s zealotry past tilt. Inept at most human relationships, Byron has funneled all his emotional capacity into Hazel, out of both passion and the gamifying impulse to get the all-time high score on his marriage. He’s the epitome of both the obsessive , and the hubristic Tech Guy, and he makes plain the connection between the two types.,He’s also pitiable, insofar as a billionaire with godlike powers can be. “I am the only person who actually loves you!” he pleads to Hazel. “Objectively!”,But it’s Milioti who gives the season’s first half (I’ve seen four episodes of eight) its adrenaline. “Made for Love” is a loopy jolt to the cortex that demands a high tolerance for absurdity. What grounds it is Hazel’s journey from kept woman to action hero, determined not to be a character in somebody else’s love story.",1
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/arts/design/karon-davis-underground-museum-deitch.html,arts,"LOS ANGELES — Some people know , mostly by association — with her husband, the acclaimed artist ,, who died at 32 in 2015; with the , that the pair founded in 2012, which features the work of Black artists; with her father, the Broadway song-and-dance man Ben Vereen.,But recently, Davis has been carving out an independent professional identity as an artist, a process that has led to her first solo exhibition in New York at Jeffrey Deitch’s gallery, through April 24.,“I always wanted to do it on my own,” Davis said in a recent interview at her studio in Arlington Heights here, “to prove to myself that I was good enough — I got it. No one is going to give it to me.”,While she has shown her work in relatively few shows and spent most of the last few years juggling the museum, her husband’s estate and their 11-year-old son, Moses, Davis has already made a strong impression on the art establishment.,“I see her in between the art world and cinematic theater performance,” said Helen Molesworth, an independent curator who helped birth the Underground Museum and is organizing , that includes Davis’s work at the Jack Shainman Gallery: The School in Kinderhook, N.Y.,Davis’ unflinching exhibition currently at Deitch, “,,” features a seated sculpture of Bobby Seale, who founded the Black Panther Party with Huey P. Newton and was bound and gagged in a courtroom at the trial of the Chicago 8 in 1969. The defendants were charged with conspiracy to cross state lines with intent to incite a riot; Seale was eventually tried separately.,The exhibition includes plaster casts of the 12 jurors, each encased in a red or blue vitrine, and a looming sculpture of the federal district judge in the case, Julius J. Hoffman, who rejected Seale’s repeated appeals for permission to act as his own lawyer and sentenced him to four years in prison on 16 counts of contempt of court. (Aaron Sorkin’s recent Netflix drama, “,,” focused on the case, which ended up with seven white defendants.),Deitch invited Davis to do a solo exhibition before the pandemic. Last November the artist, moved by the Black Lives Matter protests, settled on the idea of building a show around the Seale sculpture she had made two years ago. In a surge of creative energy, she completed the remaining pieces in just three months.,“A lot of my emotion went into this show,” said Davis, wearing a patterned mask, biker boots and a purple wig that she said enables her not to worry about her hair on Zoom calls. “I want to immerse people into my experience.”,The Black Panthers adopted , of a lunging black panther, black berets and a militaristic stance, and sometimes took to the streets with rifles to confront police brutality.,But Davis wanted to show another side of the group. Her exhibition includes a body cast of Seale standing by 50 sculptured bags of groceries to represent the Panthers’ free food program.,“They were really just trying to uplift and take care of their community,” she said, “but all that was being shown was men with guns.”,Davis’s original Seale sculpture had been gestating for some time. She grew up hearing about how her father, as a young actor, voiced the part of Seale for a reading of the trial transcript, which was released as a vinyl record.,For years, Davis searched for a copy, finally finding one in an antiques store in the Leimert Park section of Los Angeles, and listening to it, rapt.,“It just felt like this is a story that didn’t end there,” she said.,In making the sculpture, Davis left the wrapping of Seales’s mouth and hands till the last minute. “I had to take two shots of tequila and I cried,” she recalled. “I thought of all the Black men and women who have been gagged, who have been silenced.”,Drawing on her theater and film background, Davis conceived of the exhibition as a director would a stage set, designing the judge’s bench and a pile of sand bags and casting the roles using parts of her own face and those of others.,“It’s like a frozen play,” said Deitch, the longtime art dealer and former director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. “You come in, and you’re inside the performance.”,He added, “It’s the best exhibition that I’ve presented with an emerging artist ever.”,There was only one existing group photograph of the jurors to work from, Davis said — nine white women, one Black woman and two white men. She put them in individual vitrines, she said, so they would reflect each other and reflect back on themselves.,She described the sandbags as a “bit of a shrine” to the Black Panthers’ headquarters in New Haven, which was always under threat. “I don’t think people know this story,” Davis said, “the lengths they had to go to protect themselves.”,Her casts are made up of white strips, reflecting Davis’s longstanding fascination with ancient Egypt and mummification. The fraying flag in the installation represents a sense of disillusionment with the country. “We’re sold this dream,” Davis said, “and it’s fallen apart and tattered.”,Deitch, a longtime fan of the Underground Museum, had featured Davis’s work in his New York show “,” in 2018. One of the pieces from that exhibition, “,,” about the history of Black vaudeville, is now in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.,She has also tackled topics like climate change and flood displacement in “,,” her 2018 solo show, and loss in her 2016 “,” solo show — both at the Wilding Cran Gallery in Los Angeles. (One of her sculptures was included in David Zwirner’s acclaimed , show last year.),Her work is also in the collection of the Hammer Museum and the Brooklyn Museum. After seeing her installation “,” at the Frieze L.A. art fair in 2019, the Hammer acquired the piece, which addresses mass shootings through the sculptures of two students and a teacher, all in antlers, near the steps of a school.,“The way that she is responding to the subject of gun violence in this country and the vulnerability of children in the simple act of attending school was really powerful,” said Connie Butler, the Hammer’s chief curator. “It’s about the children being hunted.”,Davis continues to explore the question of safety in schools in her installation for the upcoming Shainman show, which features girls playing double Dutch jump rope and a student hiding under a desk as an eight-foot sculpture of Mother Superior hovers nearby.,An ebullient presence who would only give her age as “in my 40s,” Davis was born in Reno, Nev., and was raised in New York and New Jersey.,She recalls spending time in the theater wings and dusty rehearsal halls of her father’s stage productions, as well as being influenced by her mother, Nancy Vereen, a ballerina. Davis grew up taking dance classes, and hoped to someday join Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and perform the company’s elegiac ,, “Cry,” which she had seen movingly rendered by Donna Wood.,After two years at Spelman College, Davis transferred to film school at the University of Southern California, graduating in 2001.,It was while working as a personal assistant to a film director in Los Angeles that she met Noah, who encouraged her to explore her own art.,“He was my biggest fan,” Davis said. “He saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself. I was a closet artist.”,Moving on in life without her husband, who , of a rare cancer, has been somewhat eased by making art. “It’s always been therapeutic for me,” Davis said. “I put all my emotion into the work.”,Only recently did Davis begin focusing more fully on her practice, getting a studio near the Underground Museum in 2019, moving to Los Angeles from Ojai last July after her mother ,, learning what it means to be a working artist in her own right.,“I was thrown into this,” she said. “It’s been a huge learning curve.”,She said she has been inspired by the Black female artists succeeding around her — ,, ,, ,, ,, ,.,“This is not a moment,” Davis said. “We are going to stay here. This is not a trend.”,Still, she can’t help but regret that Noah did not live to share in her success, to rejoice in the distance she’s come.,“He wanted this for me so bad,” she said. “I wish he was here to see it.”",1

The person was granted anonymity because the team had not officially made the announcement.,Lindor, 27, joined the Mets from Cleveland in a , on Jan. 7. His new deal, coupled with his $22.3 million salary for 2021, means that the new Mets’ owner, Steven A. Cohen, has committed $363.3 million to Lindor, shattering the previous record for a Mets player: an , with the former third baseman David Wright.,A stylish switch-hitter with charisma that ,, Lindor is a career .285 hitter who hit 32 home runs in 2019. He averages about 20 steals per season and has made four All-Star teams, won two Gold Gloves and helped Cleveland reach the playoffs four times.,Only two players have richer contracts than Lindor: the Los Angeles Angels’ Mike Trout (12 years, $426.5 million) and the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Mookie Betts (12 years, $365 million). Like Lindor, Betts signed just before opening day last year after coming to his new team in a trade.,The Mets can only hope that their union with Lindor works as well as the Dodgers’ with Betts, who had starred for the Boston Red Sox. In Betts’s debut season in Los Angeles, the Dodgers won their first World Series title since 1988. The Mets have an even longer drought; their last championship was in 1986.,For Cohen, the hedge fund billionaire who is said to be the richest owner in baseball, the deal caps a busy first off-season. Previously a minority owner of the Mets — the team he has loved since childhood — Cohen spent a record $2.475 billion to buy the franchise from the Wilpon family, promising to ,.,To that end, he installed a seasoned hand as team president: Sandy Alderson, the general manager of the Mets’ last pennant winner, in 2015. Cohen put cash behind Alderson’s calculated, rational approach; despite their newfound wealth, the Mets did not simply outbid the field for every appealing free agent.,They bolstered the roster throughout, signing catcher ,, reliever ,, starter , and others. But the trade for Lindor and starter Carlos Carrasco was the true coup, and reaching a long-term deal, just before Lindor’s self-imposed opening day deadline, gives the Mets a star cornerstone through 2031.,McCann and Walker seemed especially excited about the deal on Twitter late Wednesday, with McCann writing that ,, citing the extension and opening day. Walker was succinct:,Catcher Tomas Nido , to mark the occasion: the Joker standing at the base of a mountain of dollar bills. He tagged Lindor in the post.",2

I was supposed to get up at 5 a.m., and at 5:25 a.m., my wife and I got up: “Oh, we missed it!” We run in the living room, turn on the TV and just as it came up, they were on the second guy from the supporting-actor category. And then [presenter Priyanka Chopra Jonas] goes, “And Paul ,-ci.” I said, “No, it’s ,-ci … and I accept!”,So now it’s 5:30 in the morning, my phone starts ringing. People are showing up with wine, they’re showing up with edibles — not the kind you’re thinking about, but fruit covered with chocolate, and cupcakes. My friend Hillary, she brings over a bottle of champagne — I said, “It’s six o’clock, Hillary!” My wife is crying, my daughter is crying. It stayed like that all day long, so it was quite exciting.,Six days later, I looked at my wife and I said, “Did this really happen?” But if I had to wait this long for this moment, it’s worth it, man. A very good friend emailed me two days ago and said, “Paul, this is not just a supporting-actor nomination, this is a lifetime achievement award.” I hadn’t thought of it that way, but I got a lot of work left to do here. I think this thing has added 20 years to my life.,To be honest, it’s more of a detriment than anything, because it just shows you what an abysmal failure you are in your own head. I mean, I wasn’t able to get a series-regular audition or to even get in the room because, “They need a name.” Thank God for Deaf West Theater — if it wasn’t for them, where the hell else was I going to exercise my acting chops? I had nothing. But you go from gig to gig and hope that something’s going to happen.,I put it on tape, sent it in and then forgot about it — because listen, this never happens for me. When I leave an audition with the sides [script pages] in my hand, I rip them up, throw it in the garbage. I’m not going to dwell on stuff that’s going to break my heart. But my wife, who’s my agent, called the casting directing office and said, “Have you seen Paul’s tape?”,At that point, they said: “We’re inundated with tapes. We’ve got too many that we can’t even find Paul’s tape, and we’re probably going to go with a name.” Robert Duvall, Forest Whitaker, that’s what they were looking for, name-wise. My audition tape was fairly strong, and my wife said, “Please, look for it.” Ten minutes later, the phone rings. The casting office goes, “Darius wants to talk to Paul.” A week later, he drove down to meet me and we talked and talked.,Listen, she’s been a small-time agent here for over 20 years, trying to compete with CAA and ICM. She has a boutique agency and she said, “I’m not going to close it until you’re a star, Paul.” She was always fighting to get me in a room, and it never happened. My mind-set was so stuck in rejection that even at the end of my conversation with Darius, I said, “Hold on a second, are you actually offering me the role?” He said, “Yes, I am.” But at first, I told them I wasn’t going to do the movie.,Look, I got a house to pay for here. This is not the big movie I thought it was — it was a very small budget, and I could make more money staying here in L.A. and working in the court system than what they were offering me. I’m going to go all the way over there [around Boston] for something that’s going to put me in the hole? I can’t afford that — I don’t even have health insurance for my family. So I said to my wife, “Tell Darius I’m not interested.”,Well, it looked like a pretty good movie, but I’m a blue-collar guy like my dad and I’ve got to pay my bills. Then Darius calls me: “You can’t do this! You don’t understand what this means.” So they kind of bumped up my per diem. He was so flexible with me, and I knew his heart was in the right place — he was so respectful to my point of view, to my CODA experience, that I felt like I could trust him.,Wonderful. Fulfilling. I’ve had many of those moments in a 99-seat theater, but to be able to have this captured on film is incredible to me. And to be a scene partner with somebody with Riz’s brilliance is a dream come true. In our very first scene, when he’s sitting across from me and I say, “So, how are you doing,” he’s in so much pain and he just sits there, taking a very long moment. And that was real! He just breaks my heart.,I’m forever grateful to Riz Ahmed — I don’t know if I could have done it with another actor, because it was so intense. In our last scene together, I looked over in the periphery of my eye when they called “Cut,” and Darius Marder was standing there just weeping.,That’s an argument that some would make in the deaf community, yes. However, I would argue back, because I’m a CODA and you cannot take me out of this culture that I was brought up in. I would never take a deaf role from a deaf actor who is culturally deaf, but Joe is a guy who was late-deafened.,I’m sensitive to it, and I vetted it before we went ahead. I asked Darius in the beginning, “I don’t feel comfortable having this guy be deaf. Can’t you make the guy a CODA?” He said, “That’s interesting. Let me get back to you.” He had three deaf advisers on the set, and all three told Darius, “No, it’s more compelling to have him be deafened,” to have that parallel line between Ruben and Joe, which you feel so strongly.,The beautiful thing about it is I’m hooked into [“Sound of Metal” distributor] Amazon right now, and they’re coming to me and asking for content. I have other things I’ve written, I have other deaf writers I know of, and because of this connection, I think some doors are going to be kicked down, because people are interested in what I have to say right now.,Listen, I have “Team Paul” now. I’ve got a management team, I’ve got an entertainment lawyer, and Team Paul is now advising me that I have to be very careful with the next role I take. I’ve been offered — honest to God — about eight, nine, 10 things. And I’ve never been offered anything ever! I can’t wait to get started working again, but I’m going to have to be a little selective and there’s nothing wrong with that.,I love Bill Murray, he’s the same age as me. I don’t want to take any roles away from Bill, but I certainly would like to act with that guy. I used to fantasize and meditate on things like that, things I thought were too good to be true, because for many years my prayer has always been, “Nothing is too good to believe in. It can happen.” Even though there was a part of me didn’t even believe that, the prayer believed in me and lifted me up. You’ve got to just persevere, even when the believing isn’t in you. If it’s true for me, it’s true for everybody.",2
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/politics/transgender-troops-military.html,politics,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon on Wednesday erased a Trump-era ban on transgender people serving in the military, issuing new rules that would offer them access to gender transition care and medical services denied under the Trump administration.,The sweeping guidelines allow transgender people to enlist and serve openly as the gender they identify with and receive medically necessary care authorized by law. They also prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity.,The change follows , , that restored protections put in place during the Obama administration that had opened the ranks of the armed services to transgender people. The order gave the Defense Department 60 days to evaluate the guidelines.,The Pentagon announced the shift on the same day that Mr. Biden proclaimed a transgender “day of visibility.” , and , posted on Twitter that “transgender rights are human rights” and called for Americans to stamp out discrimination against transgender people.,Advocates for the reversal of the ban were elated.,“We have consistently said that restoring a policy of full inclusion for transgender troops would be straightforward,” Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Center, said in a statement. “This is a big step toward making our military stronger and fairer, and it recognizes years of research showing that a single standard for all service members improves readiness and allows for the widest possible pool of qualified personnel.”,John F. Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said during a news conference that the Defense Department would “lead by example” on the issue of transgender rights.,An estimated 1,000 to 8,000 service members identify as transgender, Stephanie Miller, the director of the Pentagon’s Office for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, said at the news conference, though Defense Department officials acknowledge that number is imprecise and could be higher. She also said that the estimated costs for medical treatment for transgender troops, which President Donald J. Trump cited as a reason for ,, would be “a handful of a million dollars” per year.,“The Pentagon absolutely did the right thing today by re-establishing a policy of inclusion for transgender service members, who once again will be able to serve openly and proudly in their self-identified gender,” Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement.,While the move was expected, the swiftness with which it happened signaled a willingness by the Biden administration to put its stamp on social issues at the Defense Department. The Pentagon has also been looking at how the military has handled sexual assault issues.,Mr. Biden and Defense Department leaders are also wrestling with a reckoning on race at the Pentagon, where officials have had to confront a stark fact: Close to one in five of those arrested in connection with breaching the Capitol on Jan. 6 have ties to the military, and many have ,.,After the attack, the Pentagon has held a series of sessions to address extremist and white supremacist groups in the military. One of the first things Lloyd J. Austin III did after becoming the defense secretary was to order a servicewide “stand down” to address extremism in the ranks. The term refers to an issue — in the past it was safety or sexual assault or suicide — that the secretary has decided is important enough that it needs to be addressed through discussions with troops worldwide.",5
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/politics/infrastructure-crisis-united-states-projects.html,politics,"Speaking outside Pittsburgh today, President Biden outlined a $2 trillion plan to invest in the country’s infrastructure, creating millions of jobs in the process.,“It’s time to build our economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down,” he declared, calling the plan “a once-in-a-generation investment in America, unlike anything we’ve seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago.”,Public investment in infrastructure, as a share of gross domestic product, has been , for the past half-century, and it has recently become a topic of growing concern across party lines. President Donald Trump proposed , in 2018, though it was not as far-reaching as Biden’s plan, and it never became law.,So how did we get to a place where major infrastructure improvements are so clearly necessary — and what are the biggest needs?,The American Society of Civil Engineers has been releasing an Infrastructure Report Card every four years for over two decades, and the evaluations have never been very positive.,This month , its latest ,, giving the United States’ infrastructure a C- over all. That’s a shabby grade, but it reflects a modest amount of recent improvement: It is the first time that the overall score has been higher than a D+.,“We’ve made a little bit of incremental progress,” Emily Feenstra, the engineering society’s managing director for government relations and infrastructure initiatives, said in an interview today, adding that these improvements had been made largely at the state and local levels.,“What you’ve seen is treading water, almost nibbling away at the margins, when it comes to our nation’s infrastructure,” Feenstra said. “Cities and states are doing what they can to invest, funding new technologies, but there hasn’t been that kind of transformational investment that would really give us the bump up to put us on good economic footing.”,The report card analyzes the nation’s infrastructure in 17 categories, including roads, schools, transit and drinking water. Bridges were the only category in which the grade had declined from four years ago, now sitting at a C. Eleven categories have a grade in the D range, reflecting the extent to which bridges and other transportation infrastructure , in recent decades.,The coronavirus pandemic has heightened the need for federal assistance in a number of ways, including on the transit front, as , has sent revenues plummeting — putting , on already hard-up transportation systems at both the local and national levels.,But most of the nation’s infrastructure needs are longstanding, and many have to do with climate change. Storm-water infrastructure, for instance, was the one new category on the report card this year.,The extreme weather that compromised the power grid in Texas last month , of the ways in which climate change can threaten systems that lacked strong public investment. And it highlighted the ways in which infrastructure systems are intertwined.,Biden’s infrastructure proposal defines its purpose broadly, something that has pleased analysts at the engineering society. “It’s nice to see the comprehensive approach,” Feenstra said. “Not just roads, bridges, transit — which are important — but also water, schools, things that can alleviate storms’ impact. That really is key, because as much as we silo things into these 17 categories, we do emphasize that infrastructure is all interlinked, and events like Texas put that at the forefront.”,Biden’s proposal offers a framework, but he will have to work with Congress to write the legislation. Last year the Democratically controlled House trotted out a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill, the Moving Forward Act, elements of which could wind up in a final bill. It included hundreds of billions of dollars for repairing roads and bridges, funding other transit projects, making improvements to school buildings, constructing affordable housing and enhancing broadband access.,Parts of other bills floating around the House could also wind up in the final package, including the ,, which would lay out a plan to eliminate fossil fuels from the United States’ electricity supply by 2035, and the ,, which seeks to stabilize Amtrak’s funding by creating a trust fund.,Although both Democratic and Republican leaders have expressed support for a major infrastructure project, it’s not yet clear that Biden’s push will get any backing from Republicans.,The president has said that he will pay for it by raising taxes on corporations and on Americans making more than $400,000 a year, a proposal that Republicans are unlikely to get behind. One big advantage for Biden: Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the most conservative Democrat in the chamber, has said that he supports making large-scale investments in infrastructure.,But there’s also one big possible hangup: Manchin, more than almost any other influential Democrat, has a strong desire for bipartisan compromise and could balk at a proposal that fails to garner any Republican support.,“I’m going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office, listen to them and what they have to say, and be open to other ideas,” Biden said today. “We’ll have a good-faith negotiation with any Republican who wants to help get this done — but we have to get it done.”",6
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/climate/biden-climate-jobs.html,politics,"WASHINGTON — In 2017, as Donald J. Trump was announcing the ,, the largest global effort to attack planetary warming, he declared, “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.”,On Wednesday, President Biden traveled to Pittsburgh to try to make the opposite case: that the workers Mr. Trump was appealing to have more to gain from combating climate change than to lose.,It is going to be a tough bet. To Mr. Biden, a , is about creating union jobs, hundreds of thousands of them, in wind and solar power, electric cars and road- and bridge-building. Even those more basic infrastructure projects would have a climate angle: the new roads and bridges would be built to withstand the high waters and brutal storms of a changing climate.,“I am a union guy. I support unions, unions built the middle class. It is about time you start to get a piece of the action,” Mr. Biden said in Pittsburgh.,He promised “good paying jobs” for “American workers” making “American products.”,That is not a new pitch. For decades, Democrats have insisted “jobs versus the environment” is a false choice. But in the scale of his proposal and the audacity of his promises, Mr. Biden may be laying his political future on that idea.,He faces a lot of skepticism.,In Michigan, a state critical to the president’s political future, autoworkers know it takes fewer of them to build an electric car. Senator Joe Manchin III, the West Virginia Democrat whose vote could again decide the package’s fate, understands coal miners in his state would earn considerably less putting up wind turbines.,And in Pennsylvania, which put Mr. Biden over the top in November, and then hosted his speech on Wednesday, some union workers don’t see how skills honed over decades in fossil fuel industries would translate in a clean-energy future.,“They keep saying, ‘We’re going to transition you into solar jobs.’ That’s not how it works,” said Shawn Steffee, a leader of the Boilermakers Local 154 in Pittsburgh. “We build power plants, petrochemical plants and maintain steel mills.”,He asked, “Would you ask Tom Brady to play middle linebacker just because he’s a football player?”,Union leaders — some of whom switched from supporting Mr. Trump in 2016 to Mr. Biden in 2020 — say that for now, they will work with him to realize his vision of conquering climate change, even as it transforms their workplaces.,But they are skeptical that the well-paying union jobs the president promises will materialize, noting that, so far, the ecosystem of manufacturers, contractors and utility developers that has grown up around the green economy has often been low-paying and hostile to unions.,“The president’s new mantra is ‘Build Back Better’ with good union jobs that have good wages, and not just wages but representation,” said Joe Davis, the state political coordinator for the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Michigan. “But these companies seem to be resistant to that.”,And Republicans are ready to try to win back the union votes that Mr. Trump won, then lost. “Rather than picking winners and losers with pie-the-sky Green New Deal mandates, we should be embracing an all-the-above energy strategy,” Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Republican of Washington, said Wednesday.,No industry may have more to gain — or lose — from Mr. Biden’s climate plan than America’s automakers, which currently employ about a million workers. The president’s infrastructure plan proposes $174 billion to encourage the manufacture and purchase of electric cars, which today make up just 2 percent of the vehicles on America’s highways.,He envisions a not-too-distant future in which nearly half of the middle class drives affordable union-made cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles that produce zero fossil-fuel pollution, powered by millions of electric vehicle charging stations, all jump-started by his stimulus spending.,From a climate perspective, the plan makes sense. Fossil fuel emissions from vehicle tailpipes are the leading cause of planet-warming pollution in United States. Replacing gas-guzzlers on the road with electric vehicles could be one of the most effective ways to lower the nation’s emissions.,From a job-creation perspective, it’s more complicated. On the one hand, it takes about one-third fewer workers to build an electric car than a car with an internal combustion engine. On the other, the plan could make Detroit more competitive and increase its share of the global automobile market.,Mr. Biden’s proposed solution is to lure the electric-battery industry, and its supply chain, to the United States from China and elsewhere in Asia, with a mix of manufacturing tax credits and other incentives. If it works, the next two years would see new electric vehicle battery and assembly plants sprouting up across the country. If it fails, Mr. Biden could face harsh political repercussions.,“We can make it work, but we have to be intentional about policy to bring the battery supply chain back to the U.S.,” said Representative Debbie Dingell, a Democrat whose Detroit-area district is home to some of the nation’s largest auto plants. She added, “If they’re in China and Asia, this isn’t going to be OK.”,Some industry analysts say as Americans buy more electric vehicles, battery manufacturers will build plants in the United States. That would make it easier to integrate the batteries into cars and helps save on transportation costs.,But even with new plants, much of the work can happen outside of the United States. According to a , by the Center for Strategic and International Studies and BloombergNEF, an energy research group, only 46 percent of the value of a Tesla battery assembled in the United States comes from this country. The rest comes from Japan and China.,Mr. Biden’s energy plan would also dedicate $100 billion to update and modernize the electricity grid to make it more reliable and better able to route power from wind and solar plants to large cities. Mr. Biden would also extend tax credits that subsidize investments in wind and solar energy.,Accelerating the shift to wind and solar power is likely to create tens of thousands of construction jobs, economists and industry officials say. But those jobs typically pay far less than those in the fossil fuel industry.,Anthony Prisco, the head of the renewable energy practice for the staffing firm Aerotek, said a standard solar project wouls employ about 250 workers for just under a year. About one-third of the workers make $30 an hour or more; the other two-thirds have fewer skills and make hourly wages of less than $20.,By contrast, the construction of a gas-powered electricity plant typically lasts two to three years and employs hundreds of skilled, unionized tradesmen — electricians, pipe-fitters and boilermakers — who make $75,000 a year or more, including benefits.,“When you’re talking about the transition to the new green economy, the first question has got to be how are people going to make a horizontal economic move,” said Sean McGarvey, the president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, in an interview last month. “I can tell you that in the onshore wind and solar industry, for my members we’re talking in some cases a 75 percent pay cut and they’re losing benefits.”,Jim Harrison, the director of renewable energy for the Utility Workers Union of America, said that it typically takes hundreds of workers to operate and maintain a nuclear or coal plant, several dozen at a gas plant — and about a dozen at a wind farm. Solar fields can often operate without a single worker on-site.,Mr. Biden has acknowledged that his plans could leave around 130,000 oil, gas and coal workers without their livelihoods. He included a $16 billion program to help fossil fuel workers transition to new work like capping leaks on defunct oil wells and shutting down retired coal mines.,The fossil fuel industry, while generally supportive of capping abandoned wells, contends that Mr. Biden is overstating the job opportunities.,“It’s something oil and gas workers could do. They’re already experts at it, and they would be union jobs,” said Frank Maisano, a partner at Bracewell LLP, which represents oil and gas companies. “But there are a lot of oil and gas workers, and there aren’t enough of those wells.,Still, whatever their concerns, union officials have , about the Biden plan, particularly its large investment in traditional infrastructure like roads and bridges. “These investments can restore our economic well-being and create hundreds of thousands of good union jobs,” said Terry O’Sullivan, president of the Laborers' International Union of North America, in a statement.,In Pittsburgh, a former steel town that has transformed into a hub for high tech and medicine, leaders have made clear they support clean energy development. But in other parts of Western Pennsylvania, union workers closely tied to fossil fuel industries had reservations.,“I don’t see solar or wind creating as many jobs as we get from petrochemical plants, cryogenic plants or coal-fired power plants,” said Kenneth Broadbent, business manager of the Steamfitters Local 449 in Pittsburgh, who endorsed President Biden.,“There’s no stopping electric cars,” Mr. Broadbent said. But, he added, “You’re not going to see natural gas and coal and nuclear be phased out as quickly as people would like.”,A , under construction in Beaver County, northwest of Pittsburgh, employs 2,700 workers from the steamfitters union.

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/politics/johnson-johnson-coronavirus-vaccine.html,politics,"WASHINGTON — Workers at a plant in Baltimore manufacturing two coronavirus vaccines accidentally conflated the ingredients several weeks ago, contaminating up to 15 million doses of , and forcing regulators to delay authorization of the plant’s production lines.,The plant is run by Emergent BioSolutions, a manufacturing partner to both Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca, the British-Swedish company whose vaccine has yet to be authorized for use in the United States. Federal officials attributed the mistake to human error.,The mix-up has delayed future shipments of Johnson & Johnson doses in the United States while the Food and Drug Administration investigates what occurred. Johnson & Johnson has moved to strengthen its control over Emergent BioSolutions’ work to avoid additional quality lapses.,The mistake is a major embarrassment both for Johnson & Johnson, whose one-dose vaccine has been credited with speeding up the national immunization program, and for Emergent, its subcontractor, which has faced ,, especially for the government’s emergency health stockpile.,The error does not affect any Johnson & Johnson doses that are currently being delivered and used nationwide, including the shipments that states are counting on next week. All those doses were produced in the Netherlands, where operations have been fully approved by federal regulators.,Further shipments of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — expected to total 24 million doses in the next month — were supposed to come from the giant plant in Baltimore. Those deliveries are now in question while the quality control issues are sorted out, according to people familiar with the matter.,Federal officials still expect to have enough doses from Johnson & Johnson and the other two approved coronavirus vaccine makers to meet , to provide enough vaccine to immunize every adult by the end of May.,Pfizer is shipping its doses ahead of schedule, and Moderna is on the verge of winning approval to deliver vials of vaccine , instead of 10, further bolstering the nation’s stock.,The problems arose in a new plant that the federal government enlisted last year to produce vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. The two vaccines use the same technology employing a harmless version of a virus — known as a vector — that is transmitted into cells to make a protein that then stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies. But , and , vectors are biologically different and not interchangeable.,In late February, one or more workers somehow confused the two during the production process, raising questions about training and supervision. In the past year, Emergent has hired and trained hundreds of new workers to produce millions of doses of both vaccines that were supposed to be ready by the time clinical trials showed whether the vaccines actually worked.,Vaccine production is a notoriously fickle science, and errors are often expected to occur and ruin batches. But Emergent’s mistake went undiscovered for days until Johnson & Johnson’s quality control checks uncovered it, according to people familiar with the situation. By then, up to 15 million doses had been contaminated, the people said.,None of the doses ever left the plant, and the lot has been quarantined. There is no indication that production of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, which has yet to be authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, was affected.,Johnson & Johnson reported the mishap to federal regulators, who then started an investigation that has delayed the authorization of that plant’s production lines. The company has beefed up the number of its own staff members who monitor Emergent’s work and instituted a variety of new checks intended to protect against future lapses.,Johnson & Johnson already faced a lag in its manufacturing that has caused the company to fall behind on its commitments to the federal government, but it seemed on track to catch up. It delivered 20 million doses by the end of March, and has pledged to deliver about another roughly 75 million doses by the end of May.,White House officials hedged their projections in a phone call with governors on Tuesday, forecasting certain deliveries from Pfizer and Moderna but warning that Johnson & Johnson’s shipments would fluctuate.,In a statement late Wednesday, the company said it expected the steps it was now taking with Emergent would enable it to deliver 24 million doses by the end of April, or about what the federal government expected. But that depends on whether Johnson & Johnson satisfies Food and Drug Administration regulators.,The agency last week cleared a bottling facility that Johnson & Johnson uses in Indiana, allowing the release of more doses made in the Netherlands. But that facility cannot send out doses produced in the Emergent plant until the Food and Drug Administration authorizes it.,Nearly seven million doses of the vaccine have been delivered so far, and about half of those have been administered, ,.,Carl Zimmer, contributed reporting.",4
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/us/politics/biden-infrastructure-congress.html,politics,"WASHINGTON — Republicans on Capitol Hill began lining up on Wednesday against , and the tax increases he proposed to finance it, even as some Democrats suggested that the package was insufficient to address the country’s aging infrastructure and vulnerabilities to climate change.,While most Democrats showered praise on Mr. Biden for the expansive package, the critiques from members of both parties illustrated that infrastructure legislation, once seen as a promising area of bipartisan compromise, is unlikely to sail through this Congress with widespread support from both sides.,Republicans scoffed at the breadth of the plan — which includes traditional public-works projects as well as far-reaching initiatives to tackle climate change and racial inequities in the economy — and condemned Mr. Biden’s determination to pay for it ,.,“We cannot begin thinking of bills that spend trillions as the new normal,” said Representative Sam Graves of Missouri, the top Republican on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. “The president’s blueprint is a multitrillion-dollar partisan shopping list of progressive priorities, all broadly categorized as ‘infrastructure’ and paid for with massive, job-killing tax increases.”,And early concern among some Democrats suggested that the measure is likely to have a bumpier path to enactment than the nearly $1.9 trillion stimulus legislation, which moved through Congress swiftly with only Democratic votes.,Some liberal lawmakers said the package was too limited. In a statement, Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the chairwoman of the Progressive Caucus, called it “a welcome first step” but said it was “imperative that we act on a once-in-a-generation opportunity to use our governing majorities.”,“It makes little sense to narrow his previous ambition on infrastructure or compromise with the physical realities of climate change,” Ms. Jayapal said of Mr. Biden. “We have a limited window to get this done — we must seize our chance to build back better with economywide investments that work for working families and communities of color.”,With slim House and Senate majorities that leave little room for defections, Democratic leaders now must begin drafting a large and complicated bill including individual proposals for infrastructure projects and other domestic programs as well as changes to the tax code.,Mr. Biden insisted that he wanted the package to be bipartisan, but Republicans have already signaled that they would insist on curtailing it substantially, a step that there is no indication he is willing to take.,“I’m going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office, listen to what they have to say and be open to their ideas,” Mr. Biden said on Wednesday. “We will have a good-faith negotiation.”,Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, said Mr. Biden had called him on Tuesday to discuss the broad contours of the package. But he warned that the proposal “is like a Trojan horse” — a comparison he has deployed repeatedly in both Washington and his home state, where he attended a series of events this week.,“It’s called infrastructure, but inside the Trojan horse is more borrowed money and massive tax increases on all of the productive parts of our economy,” Mr. McConnell said. He said he most likely would not support such a package “if it’s going to have massive tax increases and trillions more added to the national debt.”,Republicans are already gearing up to fight the plan. Marc Short, a longtime aide to former Vice President Mike Pence, has started a new group, the Coalition to Protect American Workers, that aims to raise $25 million to $50 million from conservative donors to defeat the infrastructure initiative.,“When you are talking about tax hikes of this magnitude, I don’t see there being any Republican support on the Hill,” he said.,Girding for that possibility, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, and other top Democrats have already begun exploring how infrastructure legislation could move quickly in the coming months under , they used for the stimulus measure. That would protect the plan from a filibuster and enable Democrats to muscle it through the Senate over potentially unanimous Republican opposition.,Democrats believe that Senate rules allow them to pursue at least two more reconciliation measures this year, beyond the one that carried the pandemic aid bill, and Mr. Schumer has asked the parliamentarian, ,, to weigh in on the matter. Democrats have not yet committed to using the maneuver, though Republicans have privately said the request is a sign that their input will not be taken seriously.,Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has suggested to Democrats that she hopes to move the plan through the House before July 4, an ambitious timeline that could easily slip as lawmakers rush to iron out the details. Punchbowl News first reported the tentative timeline.,Ms. Pelosi and other top Democrats in both chambers were quick to dole out effusive praise for the president’s proposal after he outlined it in a speech in Pittsburgh on Wednesday. The plan, Ms. Pelosi said in a statement, “is a visionary, once-in-a-century investment in the American people and in America’s future.”,Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said the package “makes the kind of investments that I believe we should be making to move our infrastructure out of the 1950s and into the modern era.”,Mr. Biden is expected in the coming weeks to unveil the second plank of his infrastructure proposal, which is expected to focus on what liberal lawmakers have begun to refer to as the nation’s human infrastructure, investing in education, child care, paid leave and tax credits intended to help families.,Democrats will also have to iron out differences among themselves over changes to the tax code to pay for both pieces of Mr. Biden’s plan. Multiple Democrats, including Representatives Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Tom Suozzi of New York, have said they will insist on reversing a change included in the 2017 tax overhaul that , in states like New York and California.,They want to roll back the limit on the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, which prevents households from deducting more than $10,000 a year from their federal tax bills.,“Changes to the tax codes that affect families? No SALT, no deal,” Mr. Gottheimer said in an interview on Wednesday. “This is going to be a negotiation, but I believe the White House is open to it.”,Glenn Thrush,, ,Jim Tankersley, and ,Pranshu Verma, contributed reporting.",6
https://www.foxnews.com//politics/rita-hart-backs-down-iowa-election-challenge-miller-meeks,politics,"Democrat Rita Hart has formally dropped her election challenge in   to GOP Rep.  , just as Republicans turned up their public relations campaign against the potential election ""steal."" Hart officially lost Iowa's Second Congressional District race in November to Miller-Meeks by just six votes. However, she had filed a formal election contest with the House of Representatives asking for a recount that included 22 ballots that were left out of the final tally, claiming she would have prevailed. But amid a growing GOP-led campaign to quash the challenge and to pressure House Democrats to accept the election results, Hart formally announced Wednesday she will no longer try to overturn the election.  ""After many conversations with people I trust about the future of this contest, I have made the decision to withdraw my contest before the House Committee on Administration,"" Hart said in a statement Wednesday. ""Since Election Day, and throughout this entire process, my mission has been about ensuring the voices of Iowans who followed the law are not silenced. I am saddened that some Iowans’ votes will not count through no fault of their own. The work of ensuring it does not happen again will continue beyond this campaign."" Hart's announcement came the same day that GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy visited Iowa with Miller-Meeks demanding an end to the election contest, claiming the Democratic-led House was trying to steal away the election from Iowa voters. McCarthy argued that Democrats were only considering the challenge to pad out House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's very slim majority in the House. ""It's the people's house, not Pelosi's House,"" McCarthy said.  Hart acknowledged the highly charged political climate in her statement. ""Despite our best efforts to have every vote counted, the reality is that the toxic campaign of political disinformation to attack this constitutional review of the closest congressional contest in 100 years has effectively silenced the voices of Iowans,"" Hart said. ""It is a stain on our democracy that the truth has not prevailed and my hope for the future is a return to decency and civility."" Hart thanked her supporters and wished Miller-Meeks the best as she represents the district that was home to the tightest congressional race in the nation.  Miller-Meeks, a veteran, former state lawmaker and a physician, was sworn in with the rest of the Congress on Jan. 3, but her tenure in Congress was conditional on the outcome of the ongoing election contest.  In a video released via Tweet, Miller-Meeks said she was ""deeply appreciative that we're ending this now,"" and wished ""only the best"" for Hart and her family. Miller-Meeks had defended her six-vote win and said the six Democrats on the House Administration Committee reviewing Hart's contest shouldn't have the power to overturn Iowa's result.  ""People should be outraged,"" Miller-Meeks said earlier Wednesday at an event with McCarthy. ""... If six votes aren't enough to win an election then why are six members on a committee able to overturn an election?"" The House Administration Committee that was formally considering the Hart election challenge announced Wednesday the case was officially over since Hart is no longer contesting the outcome.  ""There being no contestant, there is no longer a contest, and the Committee will, accordingly, recommend that the whole House dispose of the contest and adopt a dismissal resolution reported out by the Committee,"" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., the chairwoman of the committee.  There is still one other ongoing House election contest from 2020. The Republican who lost to Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., in   14th Congressional District similarly appealed the loss to the House Administration Committee before going to court.  Republican candidate Jim Oberweis lost to Underwood by more than 5,000 votes. Illinois election officials certified Underwood as the winner. While Republicans have launched a coordinated campaign against Hart's election challenge as somehow being nefarious, they've raised little concern about Oberweis's contest.  Pressed about the discrepancy Wednesday, McCarthy said it was time for Oberweis to move on. ""I believe Congresswoman Underwood won that race,"" McCarthy told Fox News. ""It was counted through the states, and she has been seated, and I don't support the challenge of that race.""",5

Al Cutrona, a   who represents parts of eastern Ohio, told Fox News that vaccine passports mandated by the government would create ""privacy concerns that should be startling to anyone."" ""I want to make sure that we put a stop on this from the government,"" Rep. Cutrona -- who runs an infectious disease medical practice in Ohio -- said Wednesday. ""It's a false sense of security, a false sense of normalcy, and frankly, I think it's a very slippery slope that we're heading down."" Rep. Mike Loychik, a Republican cosponsor of Cutrona's bill, tweeted that the ""last thing we should do is follow Andrew Cuomo and New York’s example by implementing vaccine passports.""  became the first state to roll out a digital vaccine passport when it launched ""Excelsior Pass"" last week.  ""As more New Yorkers get vaccinated each day and as key public health metrics continue to regularly reach their lowest rates in months, the first-in-the-nation Excelsior Pass heralds the next step in our thoughtful, science-based reopening,""   of the vaccine passport rollout.  Several private businesses and organizations have started developing ways to confirm that someone is vaccinated, but a growing coalition of conservatives,  , and other activists have expressed concern that government-sponsored vaccine passports would be an intrusion of privacy.  Justin Amash, a former   Congressman and a Republican turned Libertarian, said he believes vaccine passports ""will have exceedingly negative consequences for society."" ""A vaccine passport — a unified, centralized system for providing or denying access to everyday activities like shopping and dining — would be a nightmare for civil liberties and privacy, and it would exacerbate existing social disparities connected to wealth, privilege, and race,"" Amash tweeted.  Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said he fears that a vaccine passport would be overused.  ""While there are legitimate circumstances in which people can be asked for proof of vaccination, we don’t want to turn into a checkpoint society that outlasts the danger of COVID and that casually excludes people without credentials from facilities where vaccine mandates are not highly justified,"" Stanley wrote in a blog post on Wednesday.  Several Republican lawmakers have spoken out against the passport idea in recent weeks.   said Monday that he would pass an emergency order to ban vaccine passports and encouraged the state legislature to make the ban permanent.  ""This is something that has huge privacy implications. It is not necessary to do,""  DeSantis said at a news conference Monday. ""We are not going to have you provide proof of this just to be able to live your life normally.""  that the Biden administration is working on developing vaccine passports, but White House senior adviser Andy Slavitt said Monday the federal government would not be mandating anything.  ""Unlike other parts of the world, the government here is not viewing its role as the place to create a passport, nor a place to hold the data of, of citizens,"" he said during a COVID-19 briefing at the White House. ""We view this as something that the private sector is doing and will do.""

""No one should expect that if this bill gets passed that their commute will get shorter or their airport will run more efficiently or that their gas prices will go lower,"" she said. ""Just like the $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill that had little to do with actual COVID relief, only a fraction of this infrastructure bill deals with actual infrastructure and transportation."" As proof, Campos-Duffy cited $400 billion earmarked for Medicaid, $20 billion for reparations for communities that have been divided by the growth of the highway system and $10 billion for a Civilian Climate Corps.

Speaking with Fox News last week, the 54-year-old said his team had completed the final examinations for activities on both the   and the ISS. Vande Hei noted that   has had a ""big impact"" on the astronauts' training, from wearing masks around others to making sure the virus is not carried up to the space station.  ""We'll be in quarantine, we'll get monitored very frequently to make sure that we're staying  .

""There are scientists that put a lot of thought into what experiments they want to get done. They're doing the data gathering and the data analysis and writing papers. My job is to facilitate if those things work when it's up there,"" he said. ""I need to make sure that they have the resources they need.

Results stemmed from the multi-case control study   and validated questionnaires sent to nearly 8,000 adults, half of whom had diagnoses for colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer, and the other half serving as the control group, without cancer diagnoses. The questionnaire assessed how often participants consumed ultra-processed foods and drinks over a one-year period. The team then used the Nova classification system, which divides foods into four categories, from unprocessed foods to processed ingredients, and beyond to processed foods and ultra-processed foods and drinks. Examples of ultra-processed products would include ""sugary soft drinks, ready meals and mass-produced industrial baked goods,"" a related   from ISGlobal notes. ""Ultra-processed foods — those that undergo the most processing — are industrial formulations with more than five ingredients which usually contain additional substances, such as sugar, fats, salt and additives,"" reads the release.

Common ultra-processed foods consumed by participants included sugary drinks, sugary products, ready meals and processed meats.

And you can get in on all the excitement  . All you have to do is   Best of all, it’s free!  . Here are the six questions to answer in Sunday's contest, along with some thoughts on how the race may go: Which of these drivers will have the best finishing position in Stage 2?The choices:  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  Larson is the betting favorite and there’s a good reason for that: He has four straight top-7 finishes, including a win. Plus, he’s one who has enjoyed some success on dirt tracks. Bell is another one who has enjoyed success at the lower levels on dirt. However, this is such a new race for many in the field that it is tough to picture how things may shake out. Which manufacturer will win Stage 2?The choices: Chevy, Toyota and Ford Larson and his Chevy team have three stage wins now – tying with Denny Hamlin’s Toyota squad for the most. Bell’s Toyota team has yet to win a Stage. Which racing team will have more cars finish in the Top 5 of Stage 2?The choices: Hendrick, Chip Ganassi, Joe Gibbs, Team Penske, Stewart-Haas Racing or None in Top 5 Joe Gibbs Racing leads the team owner standings with Hendrick right behind them. However, Larson and Hendrick could be the favorite in this race because of his strong recent performances and – once again, his history on dirt tracks. How many cautions will there be by the end of Stage 2 (minimum of two cautions at the end of each stage)?The choices: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7+ Bristol is normally not a track that you would expect a lot of wrecks on, but the dirt end of it could lead to less traction for tires and the greater possibility of some wacky stuff taking place. It’s probably a good number to pick around four or five of them to be the final total. Will the same driver win Stage 1 and Stage 2?The choices: Yes or no Larson did that last week, becoming the second driver this season to pull the trick and the first since Hamlin did it during the Daytona 500 in mid-February. It is so difficult to imagine what the track is going to look like and the strategy involved that you are better off taking no just like you would in a Gonzaga vs. the field debate in the NCAA Tournament. How many cars will end up finishing Stage 2? The choices: All 39, 38-37, 36-35, 34-33, 32 or less This is always a tricky question. The gut answer, based on absolutely nothing, is that a few cars don’t survive to the end of Stage 2 for technical issues that may end up cropping up on the dirt surface.

He couldn't see much — visibility was next to nothing during this Monday dust storm — but Logano clung to the familiar bottom lane around the bullring to collect the checkered flag on this   experiment. Logano got a jump on Denny Hamlin on the overtime restart to earn his third career victory at Bristol. But this was not the Bristol of old, the track had been covered with 2,300 truckloads of red Tennessee clay so that NASCAR could add a dirt track to the Cup schedule for the first time since 1970. ""How about Bristol on dirt, guys! This is incredible,"" Logano said to the crowd, a reduced capacity sellout of about 30,000 fans. ""There's nothing like winning at Bristol, but putting it on dirt and being the first to do it is very special."" Logano became the seventh race winner through seven races this season and gave Team Penske back-to-back victories. Ryan Blaney won in a Penske Ford last week. The Logano victory closed a weekend of uncertainty and even some hysteria as NASCAR launched this drive through the dirt. It was broadcast partner Fox who wanted a dirt race on the Cup schedule and Speedway Motorsports, seeking some new energy at its beloved Bristol bullring, said it would take the race. So NASCAR awarded the experiment to Bristol, bypassing dozens of quality established dirt tracks across the country. The snub extended to Tony Stewart, who had successfully hosted seven Truck Series races at his Eldora Speedway dirt track in Ohio but said was never considered for a Cup race. Marcus Smith, the CEO of Speedway Motorsports, insisted concrete Bristol was up to the challenge and he told The Associated Press he'd spent nearly $2 million to make the dirt dream a reality. Smith was pleased with the buzz generated by the event, even as NASCAR huddled for solutions to extreme dust, poor tire durability and shifting weather conditions that made the buildup a muddy mess. When race day finally arrived, torrential overnight rains had flooded the Bristol grounds and NASCAR had to postpone Sunday's show by a day. Through all the consternation, Smith remained optimistic and headed to the track Monday morning convinced this dirt project was a success. The final product was a doubleheader — Martin Truex Jr. won his first Truck Series race in 15 years to open the day — and then Logano closed the Cup race with the overtime victory. Everyone seemed happy, and before the race was even over, the track announced over the public address system that Bristol would run on dirt again next season. ""It’s only my fourth dirt race ever, so I had a lot of fun trying to figure it out,"" Logano said. ""I was having a blast racing, trying to find the right lanes, moving around."" Ricky Stenhouse Jr., a veteran dirt racer, was second for his highest finish of the season. Hamlin, who had last raced on dirt in go-karts when he was 8, finished third. Daniel Suarez was a season-best fourth for new team Trackhouse Racing, which is part-owned by Pitbull. Suarez's first drive on dirt came in Friday practice and he caught on so quickly that he led his first laps of the season — 58 of them in all — and even bumped Logano out of his way to take over the point. But Logano took over with 61 laps remaining and wasn't challenged until the final restart when the race went to a two-lap overtime. It was impossible to handicap this first dirt race because the teams had no idea how to prepare and the drivers had wildly varying experience.   and  , two of the top dirt racers in the country, were the favorites and the race might have gone differently had the two not crashed with each other 54 laps into the race. Seven of the Cup regulars entered the Truck Series race just to get some track time on an unknown surface, a decision that bought them two additional practice sessions as well as Monday's earlier race. Truex, a dirt novice, dominated the field to win the trucks and led a race-high 126 of the 253 laps. Suarez was the other benefactor of adding the truck to his schedule with a breakthrough finish for his brand new team. Of the so-called dirt experts, it was Stenhouse with a quiet runner-up finish who delivered. Ryan Newman, who in the past few years began racing a bit on dirt with some regularity, finished a season-high fifth. There had been serious pre-race concern that the 3,400-pound Cup cars were too heavy for the Goodyear tires on the dirt surface. The combination on Friday, in addition to kicking up serious dirt, caused the tires to wear to the cords while deep ruts developed on the track. The rain that washed out Sunday racing also washed away much of the problems, and an all-nighter by the Bristol track prep crew had the surface ready to go for the doubleheader. It wasn't perfect and the dust was an absolute visibility hazard for the drivers, so much so that midway through the race NASCAR ordered all restarts would be single-file to mitigate the sudden burst of airborne dirt. ""You can’t see. That’s honestly the biggest problem,"" Aric Almirola said after he was hit by multiple cars in an early wreck. ""In dirt racing you don’t have a windshield in front of you, so you can pull a tearoff. We can’t reach out there and pull a tearoff off our windshield, so you can’t see anything. Everybody just comes piling in because you can’t see.""",1

The vehicles operate on fixed, geofenced loops among pedestrians and traffic at speeds up to 25 mph using an array of cameras and lidar to monitor their surroundings.

Riders can either find one of the vehicles at a stop location, or hail one using an app. Harrington said the company has already provided 75,000 rides so far and has a clean safety record. The parties haven’t revealed how many vehicles they plan to produce and deploy, but Polaris Commercial VP Keith Simon said that the manufacturing process is being built to scale and that the vehicles will leave the factory with all of the autonomous technology installed.",4

""And one of the defining characteristics is that they’re so highly engineered and processed, you really can’t tell what original food stuff from the farm went into them."" ""Much of the grocery store now is populated by these products. It’s not just cookies, sodas and ice cream treats, we’re talking the freezer aisle and the pasta sauce aisle and on and on and on."" Moss claimed that those involved in the production of heavily-processed foods seen at chain restaurants and certain grocery aisles don't actually eat what they produce. He argued they either understand the health risks associated with these foods, or are concerned about ""losing control"" to the proclivity to become addicted to sugar and sodium. He went on to say, ""We’re designed to be drawn toward food, addicted if you will, because it’s the last thing we wanted to do was not eat. And so our entire sort of system, so when you look at the comparison to food to drugs, it’s not so much that heroin is the same as or more addictive than sugar. It’s using kind of the same channels to get us hooked on drugs and alcohol."" Moss drew a connection between emotions and food, and noted that companies often use this connection in their marketing. ""Combining food and emotion is something that the companies are really effective on, in terms of their formulation and marketing of the products,"" he said. It was not all doom and gloom, though. Moss acknowledged that adopting healthy eating habits is possible. ""Our habits that we form, even for eating good food, we can change, we can create good eating habits through repetition.""  Change though, moss noted, may take time.

However, the $3.9 million Salt Lake City rental she grandly passed off as the ""SHAH SKI CHALET"" actually never belonged to Shah, The Post has learned.  Instead the 9,420-square-foot home featured on the show is owned by the Texas-based real-estate rental company, Univesco Inc., which is under the limited liability company RJW Capital Investors.  Yes, it was (GASP!) a rental: Property records discovered by The Post reveal Univesco Inc. has owned the home since 2014. And as any true fan knows, in the ""Real Housewives"" universe, few things are more shameful than renting your own home. After all,  once   those who choose to rent. ""I don’t understand the concept of renting at all,"" the ""Real Housewives"" executive producer, 52,   in 2019. ""It’s just throwing money away. Especially a huge home. I don’t get it."" Steven Frey of Univesco told The Post she had no idea that Shah had been hyping the property as her own on the show. A separate spokesperson handling their Utah properties exclusively is expected to provide more details at a later time. Bravo itself may have also been deceived, considering they did not shy away from promoting the chalet on the show, including a  (Reps for the network declined to comment to The Post, but insiders told The Post they were well aware of the rental status.)

""Is this what everyone is getting their g-string up their a** about bcuz [sic] their irrelevant? Or is it bcuz they wish they could afford to pay the rent plus own 4 other homes and have an apt in NYC?"" Shah wrote in the comment section of a now-deleted Instagram post at the time. In a later post she continued to wax poetic: ""You want to come for me with your red hair and bulls–t, come harder honey. You’re about to get a taste of SHAH SQUAD and I don’t mess around. PERIODT."" Note: The Post could find no documentation to substantiate Shah’s claims of owning four other properties and an apartment in NYC. However, the sprawling chalet home featured on Bravo was up for sale in 2019, until the five-bedroom, six-bathroom spread was taken off-market — apparently during the time Shah began filming for the show, according to documents.

It sold for $213,000.   Currently, records indicate that Shah and her husband are renting an approximately $8,000/month Park City space — which sorta resembles a mini-me of her TV home — that they moved into shortly after selling their 16-year home.  Shah and her   assistant Stuart Smith, 43, were arrested by the feds on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If convicted, they face up to 30 years in prison.  ""Shah and Smith flaunted their lavish lifestyle to the public as a symbol of their ‘success,’"" said Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Peter Fitzhugh in a statement. ""In reality, they allegedly built their opulent lifestyle at the expense of vulnerable, often elderly, working-class people."" The indictment out of the Southern District of New York claims Shah and Smith executed a telemarketing scheme with co-conspirators that operated in five states — New York, New Jersey, Arizona, Nevada and Utah. A rep for Shah declined to comment on her arrest. According to the indictment, hundreds of victims, many of whom were over 55, were tricked into investing in shady projects and business services which included coaching sessions, tax preparation and website design services.  What’s worse, many of the individuals targeted did not own a computer.  The alleged scheme took place from 2012 up until as recently as this month.  ""At no point did the defendants intend that the victims would actually earn any of the promised return on their intended investment, nor did the victims actually earn any such returns,"" the indictment states.

https://www.foxnews.com//media/biden-has-a-fast-start-but-is-he-going-too-big-too-fast,politics,"While much of the media is hailing Joe Biden as a 21st-century FDR, there are some warning signs on the horizon. ""Go big"" is the unofficial slogan of the new White House, but how big is too big? Meaning, how much major change—and new spending--can the political system swallow before choking? At the moment, the man who the pundits essentially wrote off during the early primaries is off to a reasonably strong start. Whatever you think of his liberal agenda, Biden has delivered on the intertwined issues of the pandemic and the economy, and the polls reflect that. They also reflect that he has botched the growing migrant crisis on the border. But having pushed through $1.9 trillion in economic aid, Biden is just getting started. He plans to press for another $3 trillion in new programs, ranging from infrastructure to climate change. These are staggering numbers: the federal budget for fiscal year 2020 is $4.7 trillion. So Biden is proposing to spend a combined total greater than the country’s annual outlay for everything from Medicare to the military, and of course the feds have been in the red for decades. The administration says the next round will be paid for by raising taxes on the highest earners as well as corporations, which saw their rate slashed from 35 to 21 percent during the Trump years. But some moderate Democrats are already pushing back on the anticipated scope of the tax hikes, which is a problem given the party’s razor-thin margins in both houses. What’s driving this? The   that with nearly 80 percent of the top 50 jobs going to Obama veterans, Biden’s opening act has ""provided the Democratic Party with a rare ‘do-over’ — a chance to enact wide-ranging agenda items far more quickly and on a larger scale than in 2009."" The prevailing wisdom now is that Obama was too timid with his stimulus and wasted too much time negotiating with the other party. Beyond the big bucks and efforts against child poverty, the president is also pushing stricter gun control and comprehensive immigration reform, two of the hottest of hot-button issues. But he left the impression last week, in talking about the importance of ""timing,"" that he wouldn’t allow the rest of his agenda to be derailed by these thorny challenges. Leon Panetta, Obama’s Pentagon chief, told the Post that ""the biggest danger for Joe Biden is wanting to move very fast without bringing the American people with him in terms of some of these objectives."" And that is precisely the kind of overreach that has plagued modern presidents, particularly after they notch their first legislative victory. George W. Bush couldn’t get immigration reform or Social Security privatization. Barack Obama couldn’t get gun control or a host of other initiatives after his first two years. Donald Trump couldn’t repeal ObamaCare or strike an immigration deal. For the moment, the Biden team has to feel good. In an ABC/Ipsos poll, 72 percent approve of his handling of the coronavirus, and only 28 percent disapprove. Three-quarters approval of his handling of vaccine distribution. And six in 10 give him positive marks on the economy. Those are stunning numbers in this era of political polarization. As for the partisan breakdown, 92 percent of Democrats approve of Biden’s vaccination efforts, but so do an impressive 53 percent of Republicans. (He gets lower GOP scores on other questions.) In the same poll, though, 57 percent of those surveyed disapprove of his handling of both gun violence and the border crisis, with the migrant surge likely to get worse before it improves. Matthew Continetti,  , argues that Biden is ""risking Democratic control of Congress"" by pushing massive liberal programs as hard as he has. The piece reviews how presidents going back to FDR, LBJ and Ronald Reagan, despite their early popularity, got clobbered in the midterms. He might have added Bush (2006), Obama (2010 and 2014) and Trump (2018). But Biden certainly likes the Roosevelt analogy, as Axios reported in describing a private session with such sympathetic historians as Doris Kearns Goodwin, Jon Meacham, Michael Beschloss, Eddie Glaude, Walter Isaacson and Michael Eric Dyson. ""In these early days, Biden’s presidency has been less a transformation than a continuation of the partisan stalemate that has existed since the end of the Cold War,"" Continetti writes. ""Parties win elections, misread electoral victories as ideological endorsements, overreach, and pay for it at the polls."" We’re still in the first inning, though obviously, it would take only a handful of seats in the House and one in the Senate to flip control. No one knows how Biden will handle crises to come, just as Trump was optimistic in 2020 before the virus struck. Perhaps Biden is trying to get everything done at once because he knows that political popularity, and legislative advantage, can be fleeting.",3
https://www.foxnews.com//media/media-root-for-bidens-massive-infrastructure-plan-casting-him-as-fdr,politics,"Hey, is it finally Infrastructure Week? It’s not the sexiest topic, certainly not compared to the bizarre Matt Gaetz investigation or even the Biden dog biting someone again after a stint in reeducation camp. That’s why it became a running joke during the Trump administration, when plans to highlight such an initiative kept getting overshadowed by some controversy or scandal. But President Biden made it the centerpiece of a Pittsburgh speech yesterday, unveiling a plan that will cost, oh, more than $2 trillion—more, in other words, than his just-passed Covid relief bill. Now I’m a fan of infrastructure projects, which help communities, create jobs and can be popular with both parties in a bringing-home-the-bacon kind of way. But the passage of this bill is a crapshoot. Yet some major news outlets are absolutely swooning. Take this headline  : ""With an Eye on History, Biden Moves on Big, Bold and Progressive Infrastructure Package."" Doesn’t that sound like it’s ripped from a White House press release? The piece begins: ""Every day he works from the Oval Office, President Joe Biden stares across from his desk at the portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt he selected to hang above his fireplace."" In case you missed the point: ""Biden hopes to model the more transformational change offered by his acronym'd 20th-century predecessors, FDR and LBJ…He envisions a moment--one where a country ravaged by the pandemic has seen fragilities in the economy exacerbated to a level of unseen hardship--where he can usher in a transformative era…Biden is deeply conscious that it is now his moment to step up."" Do you have the vague impression that CNN is rooting for the president? Okay, it’s historic, it’s filled with goodies, it has echoes of the New Deal. But it’s a massive amount of money and may not pass. The  uses a torrent of statistics to spotlight the plan’s benefits, from mass transit and Amtrak to broadband. That ""would translate into 20,000 miles of rebuilt roads, repairs to the 10 most economically important bridges in the country, the elimination of lead pipes and service lines from the nation’s water supplies and a long list of other projects intended to create millions of jobs in the short run and strengthen American competitiveness in the long run. ""Biden administration officials said the proposal...would also accelerate the fight against climate change by hastening the shift to new, cleaner energy sources, and would help promote racial equity in the economy…The scale of the proposal underscores how fully Mr. Biden has embraced the opportunity to use federal spending to address longstanding social and economic challenges in a way not seen in half a century."" That’s an LBJ reference, if you didn’t do the math. Not until the seventh paragraph does the Times inject this note of reality: ""While spending on roads, bridges and other physical improvements to the nation’s economic foundations has always had bipartisan appeal, Mr. Biden’s plan is sure to draw intense Republican opposition, both for its sheer size and for its reliance on corporate tax increases to pay for it."" Which could, of course, sink the whole thing. Contrast that article with the  . Its headline says: ""White House Unveils $2 Trillion Infrastructure and Climate Plan, Setting Up Giant Battle Over Size and Cost of Government."" At least that gets across there’s a major fight that has two sides. By the third paragraph, the Post cautions: ""The administration’s promises are vast and may prove difficult to enact, even if the effort can get through Democrats’ extremely narrow majority in Congress."" Look, with a 50-50 Senate, Biden can’t pass anything of this scale, even through reconciliation, unless Joe Manchin agrees. And the key question is how to pay for it. Not everyone on the Hill is excited about raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy. The White House was smart to put out the details before Biden’s speech and frame the issue in advance. But that doesn’t mean the media have to pile on the FDR references and help sell the bill.",6
https://www.foxnews.com//politics/aclu-expresses-concern-with-vaccine-passports,politics,"The American Civil Liberties Union and some members of the GOP find themselves in rare agreement over the idea of vaccine passports, both expressing privacy concerns and potential government overreach.  ""We also worry that a vaccine passport will encourage over-use. The issues around passport design are separate from the question of where and when people can be required to furnish proof of vaccinations,"" Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, wrote in a blog post on the ACLU’s website Wednesday.  Stanley wrote that it’s likely the vaccine passport system ""will become over-used as people get asked for credentials at every turn."" ""While there are legitimate circumstances in which people can be asked for proof of vaccination, we don’t want to turn into a checkpoint society that outlasts the danger of COVID and that casually excludes people without credentials from facilities where vaccine mandates are not highly justified,"" Stanley continued.  The Washington Post reported on Sunday that the Biden administration has been looking at ways to roll out a vaccine passport program nationwide as more businesses are gearing up to require proof of vaccination to use their services. White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said that the White House’s role is ""to help ensure that any solutions in this area should be simple, free, open source, accessible to people both digitally and on paper, and designed from the start to protect people’s privacy."" Stanley said in a statement to Fox News the ACLU didn’t oppose requiring proof of vaccination ""in certain contexts,"" but that proof must not be exclusively digital and must not allow for tracking other personal medical information.  ""There is also real concern that the creation of vaccine credentials could lead to overuse, or have a chilling effect on immigrant communities and communities of color who are already subject to over-policing and surveillance,"" Stanley said. ""There are legitimate circumstances in which people can be asked for proof of vaccination, but right now not everyone can get vaccinated. That’s precisely what herd immunity attempts to protect against: community spread to people whose medical conditions contraindicate a vaccine or don’t have access. We don’t want a vaccine passport that leads to our most vulnerable people getting further shut out of full participation in our society."" Some Republicans have said they find the idea unconstitutional, while others tied the proposal to voter ID laws. ""Considering that Democrats want to require vaccine IDs for people to conduct their basic daily activities, they now have zero grounds to object to voter ID laws,"" House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., told Fox News. ""If under Democrat logic, you should need an ID to enter even a grocery store, surely there wouldn’t be an objection to showing an ID to legally vote."" Freshman Rep. Madison Cawthorn, R-N.C., strongly condemned the idea of vaccine passports. ""Proposals like these smack of 1940s Nazi Germany. We must make every effort to keep America from becoming a 'show your papers society,'"" Cawthorn told Fox News. ""The Constitution and our founding principles decry this type of totalitarianism.""",5

""The Democrats have grossly mischaracterized the provisions and impact of Georgia’s and Iowa’s recent election reforms,"" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel and NRSC Chairman Senator Rick Scott said in a joint statement announcing the interventions. ""Unfortunately, but unsurprisingly, many in the mainstream media have bought the Democrat narrative hook, line, and sinker in these dishonest attacks. But we are confident the courts will see through this partisan rhetoric and uphold both of the laws that reasonably balance access and integrity."" They called Democrats’ lawsuit over Georgia Senate Bill 202 a ""public relations stunt"" and the challenge to Iowa SF 413 ""baseless."" The Georgia election reform bill expands the number of early voting days, allows the observation of ballot counting, prohibits ballot harvesting and continues to allow voters to cast absentee ballots without an excuse, but requires proof of identification, among other measures. A number of Hollywood stars have said they planned to boycott working in the state, an industry hotspot, in protest of the new law. But Gov. Brian Kemp wrote in a Fox News op-ed Wednesday that Democrats have falsely characterized the bill he signed. ""These reforms have nothing to do with ‘voter suppression’ or ‘Jim Crow,’"" he argued. ""The Election Integrity Act makes it easy to vote by expanding access to the polls and harder to cheat by ensuring the security of the ballot box."" In Iowa, SF 413 aims to establish uniform voting protocols across the state’s 99 counties, hold local officials accountable for flouting state rules, allows tabulation to begin before Election Day and regulates absentee ballot drop boxes. The lawsuit there comes as GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who is the certified winner of her election race by a razor-thin six votes, is battling House Democrats for the right to keep her seat. They are claiming that 22 ballots were improperly left out of the count and would have swung the election toward Democratic candidate Rita Hart. Miller-Meeks win was certified by state officials after a recount, but the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives may have final say. ""Democrats are crusading to put Washington in charge of elections, even if it means cancelling out the voters’ voices in Iowa’s 2nd Congressional District in the name of partisan gains,"" McDaniel and Scott said.

https://www.foxnews.com//media/trump-biden-fauci-birx-why-finger-pointing-is-surging-as-covid-19-cases-rise,politics,"Just as more Americans are getting vaccines, two fierce battles have broken out about Covid-19—one about the current danger and the other about the last administration. It often seems that our political war over the pandemic consumes more energy than fighting the virus itself. And people are understandably confused about the nature of the tunnel we’re in and whether we can see any light at its end. President Biden is once again pleading with people against a premature declaration of victory. And former president Trump is denouncing two of his top medical advisers for criticizing his handling of the crisis, as part of an effort to salvage their own reputations. All this is unfolding as the director of the Centers for Disease Control is warning of ""impending doom."" While there is much reason for hope, says Rochelle Walensky, ""right now, I’m scared."" Scared of a fourth wave of the virus in the next couple of months before a majority of the country is vaccinated. And, by implication, scared of governors, especially Republicans, lifting mask mandates and business restrictions. ""Please, this is not politics—reinstate the mandate,"" Biden said. But of course, these are political decisions, balancing health risks and the need to revive the economy. But the argument over what to do now rests in part on how we got here, 550,000 American deaths later. Trump issued a blistering statement about Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, former leaders of his virus task force, ""two self-promoters trying to reinvent history to cover for their bad instincts and faulty recommendations… if it were up to them we’d currently be locked in our basements as our country suffered through a financial depression."" The former president was triggered, to use a woke term, by Birx’s interview in a CNN documentary, and the continuing media blitz by Fauci, who is now Biden’s top Covid adviser. But Trump, as is his wont, went well beyond policy to rip the doctors personally. He said that Birx, a ""terrible medical adviser,"" is ""a proven liar with very little credibility left. Many of her recommendations were viewed as ""pseudo-science,"" and Dr. Fauci would always talk negatively about her and, in fact, would ask not to be in the same room with her."" Trump also cited an incident when Birx went to visit family on Thanksgiving after urging the public not to travel. As for Fauci, Trump remains fixated on the 78-year-old having thrown out a lousy first pitch at a Washington Nationals game. Fauci ""said he was an athlete in college but couldn’t throw a baseball even close to home plate, it was a ‘roller.’"" He also said Fauci had done a ""fake"" interview on CNN—I don’t know, I saw him on camera—and that ""the king of ‘flip-flops’ and moving the goalposts to make himself look as good as possible."" So what did the two of them say? Birx told CNN there was an ""excuse"" for the first 100,00 deaths from the original surge, but ""all of the rest of them, in my mind, could have been mitigated or decreased substantially."" She said she had a ""very uncomfortable"" call with Trump last summer after warning about the virus on the network and was told she had to stay off national TV ""because the president might see it."" Birx is drawing enormous flak for speaking out now, when it’s too late, rather than challenging Trump when she had some authority. Some say she should have quit, though it’s not clear what that would have accomplished. Fauci told CNN that Birx should have done more but was in a difficult situation. Fauci is seen as having diplomatically battled the president last year and has been through many of these cycles. After the infection disease expert did a ""60 Minutes"" interview last October, Trump called him a ""disaster"" and said ""people are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots."" Today, by contrast, Biden backs Walensky when she says things like ""impending doom."" But is it impending? The plateau period is over. The seven-day average of new cases topped 63,000 for the first time in nearly a month, says the Washington Post. In nine states, the jump has been more than 40 percent in two weeks, says the New York Times. Michigan alone has seen a 57 rise in Covid cases, and a 47 percent increase in hospitalizations, in the past week. I have no doubt that much of this is tied to the warmer weather, spring break gatherings and pent-up frustrations over the past year. Virus variants may also be a factor, as well as states such as Michigan easier limits on business activity. In short, it would be a shame after a year of isolation and lockdown if we had another surge just as enough vaccines are becoming available to protect most Americans by May or June. But there are tradeoffs, as there have been since the dawn of the pandemic. In the end, Biden—and the governors—will be judged on how they handle this crucial period, just as Trump and his advisers were judged on 2020.",5

Banks urged the State Department to seek damages from China and bring the case in front of the International Court of Justice, seated in The Hague. The Chairman’s letter followed the World Health Organization’s (WHO) anticipated report on the origins of the coronavirus, which suggested the virus began by transmitting from one animal to another, but left the actual origins of the virus unclear.

""China must pay the burden and the cost endured by Americans because of their role in this pandemic,"" Banks wrote to Blinken. ""Preventing another pandemic is a goal that we all share, but giving China a slap on the wrist after it continued to lie to the world and heightened the severity of the current pandemic is only going to make that goal harder to achieve,"" he added.

Texas officials became concerned when McAllen Texas, Mayor Jim Darling was told in February by federal officials from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that illegal immigrants traveling with children were now being paroled into the U.S. as part of the Biden administration’s ""catch and release"" system as they awaited their asylum hearings, the report said.

Brian Kemp.  ""I think that today's professional athletes are acting incredibly responsibly. I would strongly support them doing that,"" Biden responded. ""People look to them, they're leaders. Look at what's happened with the NBA as well. Look at what's happened across the board. The people who've been victimized the most are the people who are the leaders in these various sports and it's just not right."" Biden reiterated his attack on Georgia's election reform as ""Jim Crow on steroids."" ""Imagine passing a law saying you cannot provide water or food for someone standing in line to vote, can't do that? C'mon!"" the president exclaimed. ""Or you're going to close a polling place at 5 o'clock when working people just get off? This is all about keeping working folks and ordinary folks that I grew up with from being able to vote."" While Biden's claim that the law forbids ""water or food"" omits the statute in the legislation that allows ""self-service water from an unattended receptacle"" for voters waiting in line, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler pointed out that the president repeated his ""Four-Pinocchio claim"" about polls closing at 5 o'clock.  ""Nope, that's not in the law,"" Kessler  .  ",3

""Through it all, I view wearing that cumbersome mask indoors in a crowd as not only allowing the newfound luxury of being incognito, but trust it's better than doing nothing to slow the spread,"" Palin said in a statement to  . Palin said her battle with the virus ""perhaps one of those that proves anyone can catch this."" The 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate has five children with her ex-husband, Todd Palin. The ex-governor said she first became concerned after one of her daughters lost her sense of taste and smell and later had a positive test. Soon afterward, Palin noticed that her 12-year-old son, Trig, appeared to have symptoms. ""I then observed symptoms in my son Trig, who curiously is the most enthusiastic mask-wearer, and after our numerous negative tests over the year, he tested positive,"" Palin said. ""Children with special needs are vulnerable to COVID ramifications [Trig was born with Down syndrome], so with a high fever he was prescribed azithromycin, which really seemed to help, and I increased amounts of vitamins I put in his puréed food."" Despite quarantining with her son, Palin said she initially tested negative for COVID-19. But symptoms such as a loss of taste and smell, fever and muscle soreness soon appeared. She said it was  ""unmistakable"" that she had the virus. ""I strongly encourage everyone to use common sense to avoid spreading this and every other virus out there,"" Palin added. ""There are more viruses than there are stars in the sky, meaning we'll never avoid every source of illness or danger ... But please be vigilant, don't be frightened, and I advise reprioritizing some personal time and resources to ensure as healthy a lifestyle as you can create so when viruses do hit, you have at least some armor to fight it."" Palin did not say exactly when her family had tested positive for the virus. Fox News' request for further comment was not immediately returned. President Biden instituted a mask mandate on federal land upon entering the White House last January. Mask requirements remain in place in most states, though some, including Arkansas and Texas, have relaxed restrictions as cases dropped in recent weeks. To date, more than 150 million vaccine doses have been administered, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",0

Please,"" Biden said Monday. ""This is not politics. Reinstate the mandate if you let it down. And businesses should require masks as well. The failure to take this virus seriously -- precisely what got us in this mess in the first place -- risks more cases and more ... deaths."" Biden's call for the American people to continue using masks to stop COVID from surging is nothing new. He has made the plea in nearly all of his remarks on the virus as president, warning that the country is not yet out the woods even as progress is made on vaccinations. Also on Monday, he announced at least 90% of Americans would be eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine by April 19, and 90% of the population would have a vaccination site within 5 miles of their homes. But the rollback on restrictions at the state level highlights the competing challenge Biden faces on the pandemic: touting positive signs that hope is on the horizon, while also keeping a country fatigued of COVID-19 regulations and restrictions compliant. White House COVID-19 adviser Andy Slavitt also had a warning for states Tuesday. ""Lifting all of these restrictions, telling people not to wear masks, gathering in large crowds, that's the equivalent of playing with fire."" Despite the administration's dire warnings, Republican leaders moved forward with plans to do away with statewide mandates on masking. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, who last previously extended her state's mask mandate through the end of March, made clear she has no intention of issuing another extension. ""As Gov. Ivey has previously stated, Alabama's mask mandate ends April 9. We have made progress, and we are moving towards personal responsibility and common sense, not endless government mandates,"" Ivey spokeswoman Gina Maiola said in a statement to the Associated Press. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who has also previously extended his state's masking requirement, announced Tuesday his plans to immediately lift the mandate. ""This does not mean that the use of the mask will cease,"" Hutchinson argued, adding that ""common sense should govern"" mask usage and private businesses' decisions on masks should still be respected. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who recently signed a bill repealing the state's mask mandate starting April 10, also has no plans to reverse course, his office confirmed to ABC News. In her press briefing Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki sidestepped questions about the impact Biden's message was having, arguing that local leaders and businesses could take action even if governors refused to do so. ""It's a tough message, (but) important for people to hear that we're still in war with this virus, and people need to still be vigilant in order to return to normal,"" Psaki said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now seeing an increase in the number of new COVID-19 cases and people hospitalized with the disease, according to CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, caused by increased travel in recent weeks, lifting restrictions and more relaxed behavior. The seven-day average of cases has seen a 10% increase over the previous period and hospitalizations and deaths also have increased. ""I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom,"" Walensky said in an emotional plea at a White House briefing Monday. ""We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are, and so much reason for hope. But right now, I'm scared.""",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/vaccinated-travelers-pricier-hotels-flights-76785859,lifestyle,"The cost of travel will slowly rebound from historic lows as more people receive COVID-19 vaccinations and book long-deferred trips, according to industry experts. This time last year, air traffic in the U.S. plummeted, with 95% fewer travelers passing through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints in April 2020 compared with April 2019. This reduced demand led to a corresponding decrease in airfare prices. The average cost of a domestic round-trip ticket in the second quarter of 2020 dropped 28% from the same period in 2019, down to $259, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Few travelers were monitoring these prices at the time since so few were booking flights. But now, with COVID-19 vaccinations opening the possibility of travel to millions more Americans each week , prices are once again set to change. If you’re one of those would-be travelers, experts cautiously advise booking your travel soon. Much remains uncertain, but prices are unlikely to return to 2020 levels. FLIGHT DEMAND SET TO TAKE OFF Experts who track travel deals and consumer interest say demand for airplane seats is likely to increase, driving prices back up. Domestic airfare prices are expected to rise 4%-5% every month until summer 2021, said Adit Damodaran, an economist with Hopper, a travel search tool. “A lot of that is based on the vaccination rollout.” And this increased demand might combine with decreased supply. Airlines scaled back routes and flight frequency in 2020, parking aircraft and furloughing staff. They may be slow to return capacity to pre-pandemic levels, even as bookings pick up steam. “Airlines are burning so much cash, so what we’re seeing is that they’re slowly expanding supply,” said Jesse Neugarten , who founded the flight deal newsletter Dollar Flight Club. “If we have to shut down travel again, they don’t want to get caught in a similar situation as they did in 2020.” HOTEL PRICES MAY RISE SLOWLY Hotel prices have also dropped during the pandemic, though not as uniformly. Room rates in February in New York City were down 37% year-over-year according to Hopper’s data, while small-town hotels saw only a 5% dip. This reflects a larger exodus from crowded cities during the pandemic. This pattern could reverse as vaccinated travelers flock back into metropolitan areas later in 2021, driving prices up. But tourism accounts for only part of travel demand. Business travel, which has all but ceased during the pandemic, will likely be slower to return. This could keep hotel prices low throughout 2021, especially in large cities. It could also suppress airfare prices somewhat, even as more tourists take to the skies. BOOKING FLEXIBILITY LIKELY TO CONTINUE Neugarten, who tracks flight deals, points to a changing travel landscape that extends beyond considerations of supply and demand. The pandemic changed how   and hotels handle flexibility, with many         eliminating change and cancellation fees altogether. This, in turn, has changed the logic for how and when to book travel. “I’m not going to book last-minute because I can get a good deal if I’m booking three months in advance,” Neugarten said. “There’s a lot of incentive to book a deal now because of the flexibility.” Furthermore, the travel trends that mark a typical year remain in flux. Memorial Day and July Fourth travel could follow unusual trends, especially in terms of when bookings will occur. “The traditional events of the year in travel are simply not happening, so there isn’t the same ‘best time to book’ that we would normally see,” said Mark Crossey, travel expert for Skyscanner , a flight search tool. And then there is the question of international travel. Many countries have limited tourists, particularly from the U.S., and these restrictions may remain even as more travelers receive vaccinations. “We’re not expecting an increase in prices for international airfare until May,” said Damodaran. And changing prices are unlikely to be geographically uniform, as countries update their policies one by one. Damodaran noted that Hopper is seeing the strongest interest in Caribbean and Latin American destinations. Uncertainties abound. Vaccine distribution hiccups could dampen prices, as could surges in COVID-19 variants. Flexible booking options, although good for customers, could lead to mass rebookings later in the year. And volatile oil markets could impact airfare prices, as they do in normal years. Despite these unknowns, experts remain cautiously confident that those looking to book 2021 travel should do so sooner rather than later. Greater flexibility reduces the risk of changing plans, and increased travel demand is unlikely to drive prices below current levels. “I booked a one-way (flight) to Portugal in July for $109,” Neugarten says. “We’ll see if I get the vaccination before. If not, I’ll push it out.” —————————————————————————————————————— This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet. Sam Kemmis is a writer at NerdWallet.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/matt-gaetzs-controversial-rise-maga-stardom-faces-renewed/story?id=76799913,politics,"In 2017, both chambers of Congress passed an anti-human-trafficking bill that provided more funds to protect vulnerable women. The vote was nearly unanimous, minus one lone holdout: Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz. Gaetz's vote at the time puzzled his new colleagues in Congress, and days later, he took to Facebook to defend it on a live stream from his parents' living room. ""I assure you it's not because I don't think human trafficking is a problem,"" he declared. ""It absolutely is. But far too often the best of intentions can lead to mission creep at the federal level."" The conservative rising star, who spent the past three years drawing the spotlight by cutting against the grain, now finds himself gaining attention he didn't seek. And again, the subject is human trafficking. Gaetz sits at the center of a   into potential violations of sex trafficking laws that involves an alleged sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl, multiple sources confirmed to ABC News. Gaetz turned immediately to the airwaves Tuesday to refute the allegations of a relationship with a minor, doing so in a Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson, who afterward called the segment ""one of the weirdest interviews I've ever conducted."" ""I have not had a relationship with a 17-year-old. That is totally false,"" Gaetz told Carlson. ""That is false and records will bear that out to be false."" Reports of the investigation into Gaetz, first published by the New York Times, have brought fresh   to the controversial young congressman. Elected to Congress in 2016 after serving in the Florida State Legislature, Gaetz is the scion of a powerful political family in his home state. His father Don served as president of the Florida Senate and has a reported net worth of more than $25 million, according to Florida financial disclosure reports. A frequent guest at   Mar-a-Lago resort, Gaetz, 38, emerged as a fierce defender of the former president who vocally backed Trump through two impeachment trials and repeated Trump's baseless claims of a stolen election in the midst of the attack on the Capitol, even taking to the House floor and falsely suggesting that antifa protesters were behind the riot. ""They were masquerading as Trump supporters,"" Gaetz said. The Florida congressman even traveled to Wyoming to headline a campaign rally targeting fellow Republican Liz Cheney after the congresswoman voted for the former president's second impeachment. Earlier, during Trump's first impeachment trial, Gaetz defended Trump by issuing a menacing tweet targeting Trump's former longtime lawyer Michael Cohen and his wife before Cohen testified before Congress. ""Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she'll remain faithful when you're in prison. She's about to learn a lot,"" Gaetz tweeted, which prompted the Florida Bar to open an investigation into the congressman's comments. Trump, in turn, has lavished praise over Gaetz at his boisterous rallies, calling him a ""great talent, young, handsome"" and saying that he's ""going places."" Trump also noted at a 2018 rally in Fort Myers, Florida, ""You talk about defending, he's fantastic."" So far, key figures in Trump's orbit, including Donald Trump Jr. and the former president himself, have yet to weigh in on the allegations against Gaetz. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a controversial figure herself, defended Gaetz on Twitter Wednesday, calling the investigation a ""witch hunt"" and adding, ""I stand with @mattgaetz."" Gaetz has broken from his party on occasion. In 2019, Gaetz was one of the few members to come to the defense of Democratic Rep. Katie Hill after the House Ethics Committee announced an investigation into allegations that Hill had an extramarital affair with an office staffer. ""This is just absurd. The only person who seems to have a gripe is @RepKatieHill's soon-to-be ex,"" Gaetz tweeted, adding, ""Who among us would look perfect if every ex leaked every photo/text?"" However, other interactions Gaetz has had with congresswomen have ignited controversy, including repeatedly commenting on Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's appearance. Gaetz has called Ocasio-Cortez ""attractive"" multiple times, and in an interview with TMZ, he referenced the dating app Tinder by saying he would ""swipe right"" on the idea of working with her on cannabis legislation. In a Daily Caller segment from 2019 that centered around Gaetz's opinions regarding Ocasio-Cortez, the Florida congressman again commented on her looks, referring to his colleague as an ""attractive lady from Queens."" Later in 2020, when Gaetz revealed for the first time that he had raised a young man from Cuba as his son, the now-former Rep. Hill returned the favor and defended him publicly amid a surge of questions. ""Many of you know @mattgaetz & I have an unlikely friendship,"" Hill tweeted. ""I can't stand a lot of his beliefs but he's been there for me when others haven't. He talks about Nestor more than anything, has done so much for his son & is truly a proud dad."" Gaetz has repeatedly referred to 19-year-old Nestor Galban, the brother of one of Gaetz's ex-girlfriends, as his son -- but has suggested that he never formally adopted him. ""Our relationship as a family is defined by our love for each other, not by any paperwork,"" he told People magazine. Later on an episode of his podcast, Gaetz said he feels ""like a single step-parent at times,"" adding, ""There's a certain kind of love that you can give to another human being, you know, that is not your own flesh and blood, that's not your own kid."" Galban was in the background during Gaetz's 2017 Facebook live stream when he defended his no vote on the anti-human-trafficking bill. ""As you guys can see, I've got my, my helper Nestor over here. I'm in my parents' house out in Walton County,"" Gaetz said.",5

In the lawsuit, James Blassingame, a 17-year veteran of the force, and Sidney Hemby, who has served as a Capitol Police officer for 11 years, quote Trump's words leading up to the riot, including Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud and his assertion that Democrats were ""trying to steal"" the  . The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., demands an award of at least $75,000 for each officer for each of the five alleged counts against Trump, as well as punitive damages and costs associated with the litigation. The counts include directing assault and battery, aiding and abetting assault and battery, directing intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violating D.C. statutes against incitement of a riot and disorderly conduct. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. Officer Blassingame was one of ""eight or nine"" officers who rioters confronted in the crypt of the  , directly below the rotunda, the suit alleges. ""The insurrectionists were throwing items, and striking Officer Blassingame and the other USCP officers with their fists and weapons,"" the complaint alleges, as a ""front line of insurrectionists was being pressed from behind by waves of newly arriving insurrectionists."" A ""forceful surge of insurrectionists pushed forward and slammed Officer Blassingame against a stone column,"" striking his spine and the back of his head, leaving him ""unable to move,"" the suit alleges. ""Foremost in Officer Blassingame's mind was the terrifying certainty that the insurrectionists were interested in him and the other officers not going home to their families that night,"" the lawsuit claims. The suit also makes a claim similar to what Capitol Police officer   told ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas about the racial slurs hurled at officers who were on duty that day. ""For the first time in [Officer Blassingame's] life, people were yelling into his face, calling him a [n-word] repeatedly and throughout the attack in the crypt. He lost count of the many times the racial slur was hurled at him,"" the suit alleges. The allegations in the suit paint an ugly, violent and vivid picture of the attacks it says Blassingame endured. ""The insurrectionists struck Officer Blassingame in his face, head, chest, arms, and what felt like every part of his body,"" it says. ""Insurrectionists used their fists and had weapons that ranged from flagpoles to stanchions and building directional signs, water bottles and other objects he could not identify."" Blassingame's ""sole focus was to do what he could to survive,"" the suit claims. Blassingame alleges that he suffered back and head injuries and ""is haunted by the memory of being attacked, and of the sensory impacts -- the sights, sounds, smells and even tastes of the attack remain close to the surface."" The suit also alleges that Blassingame ""experiences guilt of being unable to help his colleagues who were simultaneously being attacked; and of surviving where other colleagues did not."" Following the attack, Blassingame ""was not able to sleep,"" claims the suit, and he allegedly suffered from ""depression that he could not address because he was too consumed with a sense of continued obligation to continue on with his professional responsibilities."" Because he continues to work in the Capitol, ""he is unable to avoid most of the triggers of his emotional reactions,"" the suit claims. Officer Hemby, the suit alleges, was ""crushed against the doors on the east side trying to hold the insurrectionists back,"" and that the rioters ""continued to scream, 'Fight for Trump,' 'Stop the steal,' and various other slogans, as they struck him with their fists and whatever they had in their hands."" Hemby also endured being ""sprayed with chemicals that irritated his eyes, skin, and throat,"" the suit alleges. The suit alleges Hemby was ""bleeding from a cut located less than an inch from his eye"" and that he ""had cuts and abrasions on his face and hands, and his body was pinned against a large metal door."" As a result of the attack, the suit claims that Hemby's ""left hand and left knee became swollen and painful,"" and that he suffers from back and neck pain and that his skin was burned from being ""sprayed in the face and body with chemical sprays."" Hemby also claims in the suit that he now suffers from trouble sleeping. The lawsuit cites a litany of Trump's tweets and public statements leading up to the attack, including his call for a ""wild"" protest on Jan. 6 and his promotion of ""the baseless idea that Vice President Mike Pence could single-handedly reject the election outcome based on false claims that some states wanted to 'decertify' or 'correct' election results that were not in Trump's favor."" The suit also cites the words of a number of prominent Republican lawmakers who place the blame for the riot on Trump, including Sen. Mitt Romney, Rep. Liz Cheney and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who after voting to acquit Trump on the charge of inciting the insurrection, took to the Senate floor on Feb. 13 and made clear his belief that Trump was responsible for the Capitol riot. ""There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,"" McConnell said. ""The people who stormed this building believed they were acting on the wishes and instructions of their president, and having that belief was a foreseeable consequence of the growing crescendo of false statements, conspiracy theories and reckless hyperbole which the defeated president kept shouting into the largest megaphone on planet Earth."" What McConnell said next is also cited in the suit, in support of how Trump may still be held accountable for his actions even though he's no longer in office. ""President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office, as an ordinary citizen, unless the statute of limitations has run, still liable for everything he did while in office, didn't get away with anything yet -- yet,"" McConnell said. ""We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one.""",5

But President Joe Biden's two-phase   will carry a larger price tag along with potentially greater implications. The president is set to start outlining his proposal Wednesday in Pittsburgh -- the same city where he   -- in the midst of a defining challenge to his vow to ""change the paradigm."" The action will be primarily, if not exclusively, inside his own party. Both Biden and Democratic congressional leaders are   Republican buy-in, and they know that even bending or changing Senate rules only matters if Democrats are almost entirely on board with the plan. That plan will include billions upon billions for things like roads, bridges and broadband. Billions more would flow toward what progressives have categorized as ""human infrastructure"" -- paid family leave, college access, housing, elder care -- all while seeking to deliver on climate-change and social-justice goals.

South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem -- who is widely considered to be a possible 2024 presidential aspirant -- is the latest official to be at the center of debates surrounding a groundswell of bills that aim to ban transgender students from playing on school sports teams according to the gender with which they identify. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, similar types of bills have made their way through more than a dozen states, including   laws in Tennessee and Mississippi. Noem's attempt to take on the highly sensitive topic had a rocky start, despite her having expressed initial excitement at the prospect of ""defending women's sports"" in signing HB 1217 --  her state's version of a bill that sought to ban transgender women and girls from playing on female sport teams. This week, Noem killed that bill after failing to come to a compromise with state lawmakers regarding revisions to what she called ""serious drafting errors"" which she believes made the bill ""significantly different from any other state legislation pending across the country."" In a letter addressed to the state's legislative leaders on Monday, Noem expressed her concerns over the bill's language having consequences beyond protecting ""fairness in women's sports."" The concerns included worries that the bill would have ""turned any failure to make a sports team into a litigation hazard,"" while also implementing the need for parents to complete a yearly ""onerous paperwork requirement"" to identify school-aged children's genders and whether their child had taken performance-enhancing drugs. Noem also pointed to the bill's likely impact on collegiate athletics, which could have put state athletes at odds with the oversight implemented by national athletic organizations. ""South Dakota has shown that our student athletes can compete with anyone in the country, but competing on the national stage means compliance with the national governing bodies that oversee collegiate athletics,"" Noem wrote in a series of recent tweets. ""While I certainly do not always agree with the actions these sanctioning bodies take, I understand that collegiate athletics requires such a system -- a fifty-state patchwork is not workable."" Although the South Dakota governor's two executive orders do not explicitly include references to transgender athletes, they do refer to ""current policies that allow males to participate in women's athletics."" Noem said the orders ""temporarily address the problem"" and that she wants to see a special legislative session come together in the coming months to further address these issues through legislation. While Noem and other supporters of similar efforts see these policies as vehicles for protecting their notions of fairness in women's sports, the political push in South Dakota appears to be at odds with the current number of trans athletes it would presumably impact. According to data provided by the Transformation Project, a transgender youth advocacy group in South Dakota, there are only a handful of trans athletes across the state -- among them are five trans male athletes and no trans girl athletes. The evolution of Noem's stance on her state legislature's initial bill opened the door for intraparty criticism. Some social conservatives like the Family Policy Alliance seized on her perceived presidential aspirations by implying that her decision to oppose the bill could have larger political repercussions. ""It's no secret that Gov. Noem has national aspirations, so it's time she hears from a national audience,"" the group wrote in a press release to supporters. Editors at  , a conservative news magazine, called Noem's moves a ""disappointing capitulation"" and alleged the governor engaged in ""a flagrant violation of her powers"" for making ""sweeping substantive changes rather than small stylistic ones"" in her executive orders. The editors went on to call it a ""classic case of a politician motivated by immediate financial incentives (in this case, avoiding expensive lawsuits and potential boycotts) acting rashly on an issue she knows and cares little about, only to quickly realize that this was drastically out of step with her party and her base, and then frantically set about justifying her decision."" Noem stood her ground in a subsequent   published by the magazine. As LGBTQ advocates laud the outcome of the political back and forth, they indicate more work needs to be done to address trans rights. ""Nobody wins when politicians try to meddle in people's lives like this. Nobody wins when we try to codify discrimination like this. We're thrilled with the decision by South Dakota lawmakers to kill this bill,"" said Jett Jonelis, an ACLU of South Dakota advocacy manager in a statement following the termination of HB-1217 earlier this week. Following Noem's announced executive orders, Jonelis pushed back on the governor's notion of protecting ""fairness in women's sports"" in a statement to ABC News. ""If Gov. Noem really wanted to protect fairness in women's sports, she would tackle the actual   such as severe underfunding, lack of media coverage, sexist ideologies that suggest that women and girls are weak, and  ,"" Jonelis said. For now, it appears that at least one factor in the legislative saga could offer room for common ground -- according to Jonelis, the South Dakota ACLU is also currently examining whether the governor ""exceeded her authority by issuing these executive orders.""",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-questions-ncaa-limits-student-athlete-compensation/story?id=76791975,politics,"With   in full swing, the   on Wednesday faced off against a group of   at the U.S. Supreme Court in a long-running dispute over limits on education-related  . The NCAA and its biggest, most lucrative   want the justices to overturn a ruling abolishing the limits, saying it would erode the amateur nature of college sports and open the door to ""pay for play.""  argue the rules unfairly suppress their ability to be rewarded for valuable skills and abilities in violation of federal antitrust law. The case is one of the biggest tests in decades for the NCAA and its limits on athlete compensation, and it could dramatically alter the nature of college sports, some experts said. While the NCAA allows schools to provide full tuition, room and board for athletes, it places limits on education-related benefits such as computers, paid internships and summer abroad programs which can value tens of thousands of dollars. ""In the present world, as the district court recognized, we permit student athletes to receive the 'actual and necessary' educational expenses,"" NCAA attorney Seth Waxman told the justices during oral arguments in the case. ""And the (lower) court said 'no, you can't place any limit on that' ... that permits schools to allow pay for play."" Waxman argued that amateurism is a defining feature of college sports and that lifting caps on compensation would create ""a regime in which student athletes can be paid large sums of money on account of their athletic performance, which does not distinguish college from professional sports."" A majority of justices appeared concerned by the association's position. Chief Justice John Roberts noted the tens of thousands of dollars in insurance policies some schools pay for their athletes. ""Doesn't that undercut amateurism?"" he said. Justice Clarence Thomas noted the disparity between coaches' salaries and what players are allowed to receive. ""it strikes me as odd that the coaches' salaries have ballooned and they're in the amateur ranks as are the players,"" Thomas said. Justice Samuel Alito showed empathy for athletes, who he said ""lead a pretty hard life"" and face ""shockingly low graduation rates."" ""So the argument is they are recruited, they're used up and they're cast aside without even a college degree. So they say, how can this be defended in the name of amateurism?"" Alito said. Justice Elena Kagan accused the NCAA of ""very high-minded"" talk of amateurism when the schools have essentially ""gotten together into an organization that has undisputed market power and they use that power to fix athletic salaries at extremely low levels."" Justice   said plainly that ""anti-trust law should not be a cover for exploitation of student athletes."" But several justices also voiced support for the association's need to maintain a distinction in college sports. Roberts worried aloud that rolling back too many limits on student athlete compensation could be ""like a game of Jenga."" ""You pull out one log and then another, and everything's fine, then another and another and all of a sudden the whole thing comes crashing down."" ""I worry a lot about judges getting into the business of deciding how amateur sports should be run,"" added Justice Stephen Breyer. Thomas said he was ""perplexed"" about how to ensure ""an important distinction between student athletes and professional athletes without (the NCAA) constantly being involved in litigation."" The athletes' attorney, Jeffrey Kessler, repeatedly sought to assure the court that the nature of college sports would not be altered by ending the cap on education-related expenses covered by schools. ""We heard over and over again that each loss was going to destroy college sports … it's never happened,"" Kessler said. ""We're not challenging any restrictions or rules regarding that they have to be students. And, in fact, the education-related benefits here would help them to succeed as students."" The court is expected to hand down a decision in the case by the end of June.",1

Matt Gaetz is focused on allegations that the junior congressman had a sexual relationship with at least one minor, and is scrutinizing the Republican's conduct not only in Florida but outside the politician's home state too, three sources familiar with the investigation tell ABC News. The investigation, first reported by the New York Times Tuesday and  , has sent shockwaves through Republican circles, particularly among close associates of former President  , who considered Gaetz a staunch ally and loyal friend. ""I have not had a relationship with a 17-year-old. That is totally false,"" Gaetz told Fox News' Tucker Carlson in an interview Tuesday night. ""That is false and records will bear that out to be false."" Sources told ABC News the investigation has been going on for months and began during the Trump administration. Former Attorney General Bill Barr was briefed on the investigation's progress several times, the sources said. One source told ABC News that federal authorities have already interviewed multiple witnesses as part of their probe. Gaetz has reportedly told confidants he is considering retiring from Congress and possibly joining the right-wing media outlet Newsmax, according to   earlier Tuesday. Yet within the last several weeks Gaetz started reaching out to prominent attorneys, according to one source. The source said that one of the attorneys Gaetz asked to represent him was Washington attorney Bill Burck, who represented Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus and Don McGahn during the Mueller probe. Burck turned down the case, according to a person familiar with the decision. On Fox News Tuesday night, Gaetz appeared to confirm the investigation when he said he was approached by someone who claimed he could ""make this investigation go away."" ""There was a demand for money in exchange for a commitment that he could make this investigation go away along with his co-conspirators,"" Gaetz said, identifying the alleged extortionist as former DOJ official David McGee. The law offices of Beggs & Lane, where McGee is now employed as a private attorney, denied those allegations in a statement Wednesday night. ""The allegation by the Congressman is both false and defamatory,"" the statement read. ""Mr. McGee was the Chief Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida 25 years ago. During his tenure with the Department of Justice his reputation for integrity and ethical conduct was impeccable. It has remained impeccable throughout his 25 year tenure with our firm. While he was with the DOJ he would never have entertained a scheme such as what Congressman Gaetz suggests nor would he today. Unsubstantiated allegations do not change that fact.""

""I said 'whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, wait a minute, I love Kamala she's my sister,'"" she said. ""'She's brilliant, and she and I came into the Senate together. And she is as Asian as I am, we're both half Asian. But you would never say to the Black Caucus, you have Kamala, there's no need to nominate any more members of the Black community to key Cabinet positions. I mean, you wouldn't even say, hey, you've got a white male president, there's no need to have any more white males in the Cabinet -- right? So why would you say that to Asians?'"" ""I think that is illustrative of the otherness (in how) AAPI's have been treated in this country,"" she added. ""And I do talk about that in the book where I say, you know, you're always sort of like the other. You're always having to prove that you're American enough, that you're part of this country."" The Illinois senator's new memoir, ""Every Day is a Gift,"" came out March 30. The book shares stories from her life including her recovery after an RPG shot down her helicopter in Iraq and took both of her legs. She also discusses her experiences as a senator, including ""Babygate,"" when she fought to bring her newborn onto the floor of the Senate, and her experience as an Asian American woman in America. Duckworth raised the issue of diversity in Biden's Cabinet following an increase   since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. ""And I will tell you that the White House heard me,"" she said. ""They responded within 24 hours, and they said 'absolutely, and we're starting by putting a very senior staffer in the West Wing who will have the ability to say to the president or have the ability to say to his key advisers, 'wait a minute, you've overlooked this,' and that person will be of AAPI descent.'"" Duckworth also discussed President Joe Biden's  n on ""Powerhouse Politics."" The proposal, which is expected to cost $2 trillion, includes funding for modernizing transportation infrastructure, eliminating lead pipes and expanding broadband access. ""This is one of those once-in-a-lifetime efforts that is going to really bring America back to the status of a global leader economically and creates just so many jobs in this country that are so badly needed right now,"" she said. Duckworth said parts of the plan will pay for themselves, like fixing leaking water pipelines. She added that the plan could be paid for through increasing the gas tax, although a gas tax increase is not in Biden's proposal. ""It was actually the trucking industry that came to us and said 'we're spending more money stuck in road congestion and fixing and repairing our trucks because of the bad quality of the streets in this country,'"" Duckworth said. ""'We would rather raise the gas tax, and pay that because that will save us money in the long run.'"" When Karl pressed Duckworth on the gas tax, noting that it would impact all Americans, including those with low incomes, she pointed to tax credits as a way of alleviating that pain. ""I don't have a problem with going and revoking the tax cuts for the ultra-rich and for large corporations that the Republicans passed just a few years ago. That will not affect working families in this country,"" Duckworth said. ""So there are ways to do this. I'm happy to be bipartisan about it, but the key thing here is that if we don't do this, it's going to cost us more in the long run, in terms of losses to businesses, in terms of where the country will be, in terms of not having the jobs that we need."" Duckworth also shared her experience during the Jan. 6 insurrection and connected it to the title of her book, which she called ""a love letter to America."" ""Betrayal is the best that I can describe how I felt and how I still feel today,"" she said. ""But after all that, this democracy, this country, despite all of our divides and what happened then, is still worth it. We are-- it's still worth working towards that more perfect union.""",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/tampa-bay-buccaneers-rb-job-open-leonard-fournettes/story?id=76773378,sports,"TAMPA, Fla. -- Four days after the           re-signed running back          , who went from a backup during the regular season to 448 scrimmage yards in four postseason games, coach Bruce Arians said he is leaving the door open for who will start in 2021. ""No. That will all be defined through practice and OTAs and training camp and preseason,"" Arians said Tuesday. ""There are no starters. This is a new football team. I made that message clear when they left, that that team won the Super Bowl. This team hasn't done sh--. All those things will be defined in practice."" It was a different tune from when Fournette first signed with the club in Week 1 of the regular season last year, and Arians made it clear that Ronald Jones would be the starter, something he reiterated throughout the season. It wasn't until Jones suffered a broken finger that required surgery and was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list that Fournette saw starting action in Weeks 15-17. That action continued when Jones suffered a quad injury just prior to the wild-card game at Washington, allowing Fournette to earn the moniker ""Playoff Lenny,"" and later ""Lombardi Lenny."" Fournette started all four postseason games. ""Those guys. They all know what the system is. The best players are gonna play,"" Arians said. ""Obviously we had two really, really good ones at that position, and I really like          . I think with an offseason, he's gonna have a breakout year also. All those roles will be defined when we get to the last week of the preseason."" When asked about wide receiver          , their only key free agent who has not been re-signed, and how quickly he hopes to have that position resolved, either by re-signing Brown or adding an outside free agent, Arians said, ""[We're] just gonna take our time. There's offers out there, and we'll see how it goes."" Arians said that, just like last year, the team would consider drafting a quarterback to develop behind          , even at No. 32 in the first round. ""We go into that every year. If the guy is there at the right time that we really think has a great future, and no better time than to have one sit for a couple years and learn from those two guys -- each round, there's gonna be one of those guys in that picture to try to see who's the best available right then."" Arians also provided an update on tight end          , who suffered a torn Achilles tendon in Week 4, just as he was getting into a groove with Brady. ""Yeah, he's real close,"" Arians said. ""He's not running on the grass yet, but he's really close. The last time I checked, he was 80, 85% bodyweight running on Ultra G, and he looks fantastic. I don't see any setbacks. If and when we can get together this offseason program, on the field, he'll be ready to go. What a huge addition to have him back because he was having a great year. ... The sky's the limit for what he can do in this offense.""",2
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bidens-big-push-massive-infrastructure-plan-proposed-tax/story?id=76770525,politics,"President   on Wednesday unveiled what he has called his  , a roughly $2 trillion   plan to modernize thousands of miles of roads, fix thousands of bridges, expand broadband access and replace all lead pipes carrying drinking water. ""It's not a plan that tinkers around the edges,"" Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh. ""It's a once-in-a-generation investment in America, unlike anything we've seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago. In fact, it's the largest American jobs investment since World War II."" To pay for it, he is proposing trillions of dollars in   on corporations -- making a traditionally bipartisan issue one expected to trigger Republican opposition. He said he would invite Republicans to the Oval Office and ""listen to them"" and their ideas about how to pay for his proposals. The president also faces headwinds from progressive Democrats who do not think the spending package is large enough, as well as more centrist Democrats who feel the opposite. Balancing their competing interests will prove essential as the Democratic leadership pushes a bill through a Congress it only very narrowly controls. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told colleagues Monday she hopes to pass it by July 4, if not later that month, according to a person familiar with her comments. ""I'm convinced that if we act now, in 50 years, people are going to look back and say, 'This was the moment that America won the future,'"" Biden said Wednesday, decrying the state of U.S. infrastructure compared to other countries. ""What I'm proposing is a one-time capital investment of roughly $2 trillion in America's future, spread largely over eight years. It will generate historic job growth, historic economic growth, help businesses to compete internationally and create more revenue as well."" Biden's spending plan, he said, will create millions of jobs. He detailed the first part during a speech in industry- and union-centric Pittsburgh, where he also kicked off his campaign in 2019, pledging to restore the middle class. ""Two years ago, I began my campaign here in Pittsburgh, saying I was running to 'rebuild the backbone of America,'"" Biden said, calling himself a ""union guy."" ""And today, I return as your president to lay out the vision of how I believe we do that."" The president proposed pairing the decade's worth of spending with a series of tax hikes on corporations, which the White House said will pay the full infrastructure costs over 15 years. Biden proposes raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, a return to the level before the 2017 GOP rewrite of the tax code. His plan would also increase taxes on multinational companies' profits abroad and would eliminate subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, among other ideas. On a call with reporters Tuesday night, an administration official wouldn't say if Biden plans to send one entire package or separate proposals to Congress. The official also wouldn't say when any of the proposed infrastructure projects could potentially get started. When asked how many jobs the proposal -- which is being called the ""American Jobs Plan"" -- would create, the official would not provide a specific number, only saying it would ""create millions and millions of jobs."" Biden said he planned to roll out a second component of his proposal later in April, which press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday would center on ""creating economic security for the middle class through investments in child care, health care, education and other areas."" That part could total more than $1 trillion in additional spending, according to people familiar with a Tuesday briefing for top senators on congressional committees who will be involved in crafting the package. In recent months, Biden has signaled that he would pay for future spending proposals by raising taxes not just on corporations but on wealthy individuals, too. Biden had previously said that Americans making over $400,000 per year would see their taxes increase and that he supported taxing capital gains as normal income, which are not among the ideas the White House proposed this week. An administration official told ABC News that ""the focus of this plan is on corporate tax reform,"" and Biden reiterated Wednesday that those making less than $400,000 annually would not see an increase. ""No one, let me say it again, no one making under $400,000 will see their federal taxes go up, period,"" he said. ""This is not about penalizing anyone. I have nothing against millionaires and billionaires. I believe American -- in American capitalism."" It's possible that those tax proposals could appear alongside next month's spending proposal. The package is separated into four areas: transportation, home, care and research-and-development infrastructure. Among the proposals is $621 billion in updates to modernize roads, rails, ports, airports, mass transit and highways; $100 billion to eliminate 100% of lead pipes; $100 billion to build out high-speed broadband across the country; $400 billion for community-based care for elderly Americans and a $180 billion investment in clean energy. It also includes $174 billion to spur job growth in the electric-vehicle market and create a national network of 500,000 electric-vehicle chargers by 2030. ""They are among the highest-valued investments that we can make in the nation,"" Biden said, arguing they would improve the country's competitiveness. He invoked the space program more than once, noting nearly 2,000 impactful products and services it generated and implored Americans ""to imagine again"" ""The rest of the world is closing in, and closing in fast,"" Biden said. ""We can't allow this to continue. An American Jobs Plan is the biggest increase in our federal, non-defense research and development spending on record."" As president-elect, Biden laid out ""a two-step plan of rescue and recovery"" -- the first, his   relief proposal, a version of which became law this month, and the second, what he called his ""Build Back Better"" plan. That plan, he said in January, ""will make historic investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, innovation, research and development, and clean energy. Investments in the caregiving economy and in skills and training needed by our workers to compete and win the global economy of the future."" Biden has prioritized the major spending plan, the first half of his package, as he seizes on any early momentum after pushing the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package through Congress. But with a razor-thin Democratic majority in the House -- he can only afford to lose eight Democratic votes -- and an evenly split Senate, it remains to be seen whether the infrastructure package could pass through Congress. While improving airports and roads typically find bipartisan support, the Biden administration's plans to fund improvements through tax increases could turn off most, if not all, Republicans, and potentially even some Democrats. The coronavirus relief package was popular among Americans, including Republicans, but it did not garner a   in Congress. As it did with the relief package, the White House has similarly leaned into popular support for infrastructure improvements -- a sign it is prepared to use, and will try to shape, public opinion as a cudgel to bring lawmakers on board. Another threat came this week from several New York-area House Democrats who want to see Biden lift the cap on the deduction for state-and-local taxes, known as SALT, imposed by a law then-President Donald Trump signed in 2017. Doing so would benefit suburban homeowners, although some progressive Democrats could balk at the notion of a tax change that would benefit relatively wealthier Americans. ""If SALT is not included, I'm not voting for any changes to the tax code,"" Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., told ABC News this week. ""We all put our different interests about different issues on the back burner for the American Rescue Plan because it was so important that we all come together on it."" On Tuesday, Suozzi issued a statement with two other Democrats, Reps. Bill Pascrell and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, opposing any deal that does not reverse the cap on the SALT deduction. ""We say, 'No SALT, no deal,'"" they said. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, too, on Wednesday said he would ""fight hard"" to get the SALT deduction caps lifted, although the New Yorker backed Biden's infrastructure plan and touted the jobs the White House said it would create. Biden's plan does not reverse the cap on SALT deduction. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told reporters on Tuesday that the group would not take a position on lifting the cap, but added, ""I'm not sure that our members will see it as some of the fundamental reforms to the tax system that would make the system more fair."" The White House has indicated that Biden would be willing to negotiate on potential new taxes that are sure to be unpalatable to Republicans and Democrats alike. ""The president has a plan to fix our infrastructure and a plan to pay for it,"" Psaki said Monday. ""But we are also open to having that discussion, and we certainly expect to have the discussion with members of Congress, as we move forward, about areas where they agree, where they disagree, where they would like to see greater emphasis or not."" Biden has said he wants to attempt to pass a major infrastructure package as his second priority -- before legislation on immigration or gun reform, for example -- because he thinks the current, divisive political climate may be more tolerant of a spending plan could help the United States ""compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs."" ""It's a matter of timing,""   last week. But if Republican support does not materialize this time either, Schumer's office this week hinted at the possibility Democrats in that chamber could try to push through the president's proposals through a budgetary process known as ""reconciliation"" -- the same way they passed Biden's COVID-19 relief bill. That process would allow for a simple majority -- including Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote -- to pass Biden's bills, unlike the 60 votes normally needed. But that step would require the support of all 50 Senate Democrats -- far from guaranteed after centrists have expressed a desire for prioritizing bipartisanship this time around. Asked on Tuesday night's call if the White House hopes to use reconciliation to push the package through, an administration official would only say, ""this is the beginning of a process"" and would be reaching out to Republicans and Democrats. Biden could also face competing pressures inside his party on the overall size of the package, with Jayapal and other progressives encouraging the White House to think bigger. ""The Biden proposal on the campaign trail was significantly larger than what's been discussed so far,"" Jayapal said. ""We really think there's ample room to get the overall number up to somewhere in that range (of $6.5 trillion and $11 trillion over the next 10 years) in order to really tackle the scale of investment that we need to make.""",6
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/nfl-owners-approve-17-game-season-2021/story?id=76773900,sports,"NFL owners approved the expansion of the regular season to 17 games Tuesday, a long-expected decision that will generate additional revenue for the country's richest sports league. Players agreed to the additional game as part of their 2020 collective bargaining agreement, which gave the league an option to expand as soon as the 2021 season. The preseason will be reduced from four games to three to maintain compliance with the collective bargaining agreement, which limits the total number of preseason and regular-season games played to 20. There will remain one bye week per team. The season will begin on Thursday night, Sept. 9 and will end on Jan. 9, 2022. The Pro Bowl will be played on Feb. 6, 2022 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas and the Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles has been pushed back one week, from Feb. 6 to Feb. 13, 2022. ""This is a monumental moment in NFL history,"" NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. ""The CBA with the players and the recently completed media agreements provide the foundation for us to enhance the quality of the NFL experience for our fans. And one of the benefits of each team playing 17 regular-season games is the ability for us to continue to grow our game around the world."" The formula for scheduling a season with an odd number of games will consist of two parts. First, AFC and NFC teams will alternate annually between eight and nine home games. The AFC will have nine in 2021. The extra game will be a cross-conference matchup based on the previous year's divisional standings and the division schedule rotation from two seasons prior. The full 2021 schedule will be released later this spring. The NFL said that the enhanced season will guarantee that, starting in 2022, each team will play an international game at least once every eight seasons. Up to four neutral-site games will be scheduled with the initial focus on Canada, Europe, Mexico, South America and the United Kingdom. The league said interested teams can also volunteer to play home games internationally as they currently can do. Although the NFL Players Association agreed to the change last year, some players have spoken out on social media in recent weeks to express their displeasure with their additional game. On Sunday,            running back           tweeted it was ""dumb ... as hell"" and           safety           tweeted: ""We really let this happen."" Player salaries won't change, but they will be paid over 18 weeks rather than 17. Some player benefits will be altered, however. The owners' decision to activate the 17-game option will trigger changes to offseason and in-season workouts, according to NFLPA assistant executive director of external affairs George Atallah. Among them is a reduction in the maximum amount of time players can be required to spend at a team facility during the season. The NFLPA has been advocating since December to make last year's virtual offseason permanent as a way to reduce wear and tear on their bodies. Tuesday's approval came one year after owners expanded the playoff field from 12 to 14 games, a decision that created two additional playoff games and was estimated to generate $150 million in additional annual revenue. Most NFL revenues are split with players according to the terms of the CBA; the addition of the 17th game pushes the players' distribution to 48.5% of shareable revenues. Assurances of this expansion were baked into new media distribution rights the league announced earlier this month with Amazon, CBS, ESPN/ABC, FOX, and NBC.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/older-americans-largely-vaccinated-covid-19-cases-younger/story?id=76777363,politics,"As more older Americans get vaccinated an increasing number of new   cases are impacting younger adults,   that   in an effort to prevent more people from becoming sick. The number of new COVID-19 cases increased more than 10% in 26 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico since last week, a possible signal that the country is on the  . And for the first time, the majority of new hospitalizations have been younger adults, with cases among people ages 50-65 increasing more than those older than 65, who are more likely to have been vaccinated. And in some states, like Michigan and Massachusetts, the number of cases among older children, teenagers and young adults have also increased. At the same time recent data showed a 96% decline in COVID-19 cases in nursing homes since the vaccine rollout began in December, indicating high vaccination rates are helping protect older populations. Dr. Nick Gilpin, chief medical officer for Beaumont Health system in Michigan, said the average age of their COVID-19 patients is 46 years old. ""A lot of these individuals have been doing all of those things that we’ve been warning about: gathering together in large groups, going to bars and restaurants,"" he told ABC News. Public   experts say a more serious spike in cases can still be prevented, but only if everyone doubles down on protections like wearing masks, avoiding indoor gatherings, refraining from nonessential travel and getting vaccinated as soon as possible. ""I so badly want to be done. I know you all so badly want to be done. We are just almost there, but not quite yet,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said in  Walensky and other public health officials said cases are increasing because people began to relax their behavior while there was still a lot of the virus spreading in the country, particularly newer variants that can spread more easily. As more states have relaxed restrictions and more people have been traveling, the virus has taken advantage of more opportunities to spread. ""The rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases in teens and young adults is very troubling. Tragically, states -- like Massachusetts -- ignored the advice of public health officials and re-opened too quickly,"" said Sam Scarpino, an assistant professor in the emerging epidemics lab at Northeastern University. ""As a result we're at risk, entering another surge and delaying our safe return to normalcy,"" Scarpino added. Twenty-six states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have seen an increase of over 10% in the number of new cases since last week. New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Rhode Island, and Connecticut currently hold the highest case rates per 100,000 people over the last seven days. Hospital admissions are also increasing in nearly a dozen states. As more states push to reopen schools and businesses the increased activity also creates more opportunities for the virus to spread among younger groups that have thus far not been seen as at high risk for severe illness. ""Not many states make age data available over time, but in the few that do, older children -- 10-19 -- and young adults are making up a larger fraction of the cases. This likely reflects a combination of widespread vaccination among older adults and increased mobility among young people, through school reopening and more community activities,"" said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Rivers said a new surge among younger adults wouldn't necessarily lead to increases in hospitalizations and deaths like the trend with  . ""Through most of the pandemic, hospitalizations and deaths have tracked closely with cases. But now that nearly three in four people over the age of 65 have had at least one dose of the vaccine, we’ll start to see that change. I expect that even in places where cases surge, we won’t see as many severe cases as we would have six months ago,"" she said. But Walensky and other public health officials said even if a ""fourth surge"" in cases affects more younger adults, they're still concerned about any increase in how much the virus is spreading. ""There are plenty of reasons to not want to have COVID outside of just the deaths alone,"" Walensky said in an interview on MSNBC on Monday night. ""We know that about 10% of the population that gets sick with COVID has long haul syndrome, has symptoms beyond three weeks, cardiac challenges, depression and mental health challenges, pulmonary challenges, renal failure, clotting. So there's a lot we don't understand about this disease, and we shouldn't want to have it circulating whether or not it leads to mortality,"" she continued.",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/houston-texans-gm-lawsuits-filed-deshaun-watson-troubling/story?id=76774619,sports,"HOUSTON --           general manager Nick Caserio said the lawsuits filed against           alleging sexual assault and inappropriate conduct are ""certainly troubling"" and something the team takes ""very seriously."" Houston lawyer Tony Buzbee has filed 19 civil lawsuits against Watson on behalf of women who allege inappropriate behavior and sexaul assault during massage sessions with the Texans quarterback. Three of the lawsuits filed Sunday night accuse Watson of ""purposely"" touching the women with his penis and state that his ""behavior is part of a disturbing pattern."" ""We're certainly cognizant and aware,"" Caserio told the Texans All Access podcast. ""We made a statement at the beginning about where the organization stood. I would say it's a legal situation, it's a legal process, so we're certainly respectful of that. ""We certainly take them very seriously. The allegations, what's been discussed, are certainly troubling. And organizationally that's not something that we can condone, that we condone, those types of actions."" Caserio's comments on Watson's situation are the first by a member of the team. Head coach David Culley has not spoken to the media since the first lawsuit was filed March 16. The team has released two statements and said in one that it would stay in close contact with the NFL during its investigation under the league's personal conduct policy. Watson has publicly denied any wrongdoing, and Watson's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said last week that he believes ""any allegation that Deshaun forced a woman to commit a sexual act is completely false."" Hardin also said in a statement last week that his law firm has ""strong evidence"" showing that one of the lawsuits alleging sexual assault is false and that it ""calls into question the legitimacy of the other cases as well."" Buzbee said in an Instagram post on Tuesday night that he's filed two more lawsuits against Watson; lawsuits filed after 5 p.m. CT generally don't appear until the next morning on the Harris County District Clerk's website, so it's unclear if they've been submitted. Buzbee said earlier this month that he would submit affidavits and evidence from several women to the Houston Police Department and the Houston district attorney. Buzbee also said he will request that a grand jury consider the evidence and determine whether charges should be brought against Watson by the state of Texas. Dane Schiller, a spokesperson for the Harris County district attorney, said last week that it would be ""inappropriate"" for the DA's office to comment on the lawsuits against Watson. ""It would be inappropriate for the District Attorney's Office to comment on a civil lawsuit, and we refrain from publicly discussing allegations in any matter until and if a criminal charge is filed; we do this out of fairness to all,"" Schiller said in a statement.",1
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/leonard-fournette-playoffs-create-tampa-bay-buccaneers-rb/story?id=76774413,sports,"TAMPA, Fla. -- When           signed with the           in Week 1 last season, coach Bruce Arians said that           was still his starter at running back. He reiterated that throughout the season. But after Fournette, who re-signed four days ago, had 448 scrimmage yards in four postseason games on the way to a Super Bowl title, Arians is leaving the door open on who will start in 2021. ""No. That will all be defined through practice and OTAs and training camp and preseason,"" Arians said Tuesday. ""There are no starters. This is a new football team. I made that message clear when they left, that that team won the Super Bowl. This team hasn't done s---. All those things will be defined in practice."" Last season, Fournette didn't see starting action until Weeks 15-17 after Jones suffered a broken finger that required surgery and was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list. That action continued when Jones suffered a quad injury just prior to the wild-card game at Washington, allowing Fournette to earn the moniker ""Playoff Lenny,"" and later ""Lombardi Lenny."" Fournette started all four postseason games, and now he has a chance to start this season. ""Those guys. They all know what the system is. The best players are gonna play,"" Arians said. ""Obviously we had two really, really good ones at that position, and I really like              . I think with an offseason, he's gonna have a breakout year also. All those roles will be defined when we get to the last week of the preseason."" Jones rushed for 978 yards on 192 carries (5.09 average) and seven rushing touchdowns during the regular season, with 28 receptions and 165 receiving yards. Fournette had 367 yards on 97 carries (3.78 average) and six rushing touchdowns during the regular season, with 36 receptions and 233 receiving yards. But in the postseason, Fournette had 82 touches in four games for 448 scrimmage yards and four touchdowns. Jones, who was back to playing in the divisional game at New Orleans, had 139 scrimmage yards on 35 touches in three postseason games, with no touchdowns. Fournette averaged 4.69 yards per rush in the postseason while Jones averaged 3.97. When asked about wide receiver              , their only key free agent who has not been re-signed, and how quickly he hopes to have that position resolved, either by re-signing Brown or adding an outside free agent, Arians said, ""[We're] just gonna take our time. There's offers out there, and we'll see how it goes."" Arians said that, just like last year, the team would consider drafting a quarterback to develop behind              , even at No. 32 in the first round. ""We go into that every year. If the guy is there at the right time that we really think has a great future, and no better time than to have one sit for a couple years and learn from those two guys -- each round, there's gonna be one of those guys in that picture to try to see who's the best available right then."" Arians also provided an update on tight end              , who suffered a torn Achilles tendon in Week 4, just as he was getting into a groove with Brady. ""Yeah, he's real close,"" Arians said. ""He's not running on the grass yet, but he's really close. The last time I checked, he was 80, 85% bodyweight running on Ultra G, and he looks fantastic. I don't see any setbacks. If and when we can get together this offseason program, on the field, he'll be ready to go. What a huge addition to have him back because he was having a great year. ...

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/nfl-owners-approve-17-game-season-starting-2021/story?id=76774908,sports,"NFL owners approved the expansion of the regular season to 17 games Tuesday, a long-expected decision that will generate additional revenue for the country's richest sports league. Players agreed to the additional game as part of their 2020 collective bargaining agreement, which gave the league an option to expand as soon as the 2021 season. The preseason will be reduced from four games to three to maintain compliance with the CBA, which limits the total number of preseason and regular-season games played to 20. There will remain one bye week per team. The season will begin on Thursday night, Sept. 9, and will end on Jan. 9, 2022. The Pro Bowl will be played on Feb. 6, 2022, at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, and Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles has been pushed back one week, from Feb. 6 to Feb. 13, 2022. Speaking shortly after owners concluded the first day of a two-day virtual meeting, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said the decision to expand was a ""monumental moment in NFL history."" He also cited league data that had traced the highest rate of player injuries to preseason games. (Many of those who play extensively in preseason games are backups and other players unlikely to make the team.) ""What we are actually doing is following the data and following the science to make sure that we are doing things [well] both from a health and safety standpoint as well as seeking to get better in every way,"" he said. The formula for scheduling a season with an odd number of games will consist of two parts. First, AFC and NFC teams will alternate annually between eight and nine home games. The AFC will have nine in 2021. The extra game will be a cross-conference matchup based on the previous year's divisional standings and the division schedule rotation from two seasons prior. The full 2021 schedule will be released later this spring. The NFL said that the enhanced season will guarantee that, starting in 2022, each team will play an international game at least once every eight seasons. Up to four neutral-site games will be scheduled with the initial focus on Canada, Europe, Mexico, South America and the United Kingdom. The league said interested teams can also volunteer to play home games internationally as they currently can do. Chris Halpin, the NFL's executive vice president and chief strategy and growth officer, said that Germany is among the countries that could host a game in the coming years. Although the NFL Players Association agreed to the change last year, some players have spoken out on social media in recent weeks to express their displeasure with their additional game. On Sunday,            running back           tweeted it was ""dumb ... as hell,"" and           safety           tweeted: ""We really let this happen."" Player salaries won't change, but they will be paid over 18 weeks rather than 17. Some player benefits will be altered, however. The owners' decision to activate the 17-game option will trigger changes to offseason and in-season workouts, according to NFLPA assistant executive director of external affairs George Atallah. Among them is a reduction in the maximum amount of time players can be required to spend at a team facility during the season. The NFLPA has been advocating since December to make last year's virtual offseason permanent as a way to reduce wear and tear on their bodies. The league is working on a plan for this year's offseason program, which will be affected in at least some way by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In a Tuesday memo obtained by ESPN, the league informed teams that OTAs for all teams will begin April 19. (In previous years, teams with new head coaches were allowed to begin two weeks earlier than others.) OTAs remain voluntary for all players, per the CBA; COVID-19 testing protocols established last year will remain in place; and workout bonuses in player contracts must be paid as specified in those contracts. The league and the NFLPA expect to continue, over the next 10 days, discussion of other matters regarding the offseason program, including whether OTA meetings will be held virtually or in person, what the requirements and restrictions will be for on-field participation, and other matters. The memo states that if no agreement is reached between the league and the players' union on those issues, current CBA guidelines will govern 2021 OTAs. Tuesday's approval came one year after owners expanded the playoff field from 12 to 14 games, a decision that created two additional playoff games and was estimated to generate $150 million in additional annual revenue. Most NFL revenue is split with players according to the terms of the CBA; the addition of the 17th game pushes the players' distribution to 48.5% of shareable revenue. ""Since players share the revenue that is brought into the NFL, more money for the NFL means more money for the players as well. The new CBA also increases the players' revenue share as part of the negotiated media kicker, which comes into effect when we play 17 regular season games. As a result, players will see even larger revenue increases in future years, when the new media revenues really begin,"" the NFL Players Association said in a statement. Assurances of this expansion were baked into new media distribution rights the league announced earlier this month with Amazon, CBS, ESPN/ABC, Fox and NBC. According to multiple reports, those deals will bring the NFL and its players more than $100 billion in revenue between the 2023 and 2033 seasons. The NFL has played 16-game seasons since 1978, but some owners have been pushing to expand for more than a decade. The league came close to imposing it in 2014, without an agreement from players, but ultimately tabled the plan to save it as a bargaining chip for next CBA.",2

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrat-rita-hart-ends-election-challenge-close-iowa/story?id=76796759,politics,"Democrat Rita Hart announced she's withdrawing her challenge to the results in Iowa's 2nd Congressional District, ending a   over the last contest of the 2020  . Hart dropped her petition before the House panel tasked with overseeing the review, according to a statement released Wednesday, amid intense pressure from both sides. ""After many conversations with people I trust about the future of this contest, I have made the decision to withdraw my contest before the House Committee on Administration,"" she said, citing ""the toxic campaign of political disinformation to attack this constitutional review of the closest congressional contest in 100 years."" ""It is a stain on our democracy that the truth has not prevailed and my hope for the future is a return to decency and civility,"" she added. GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks was   in November by a mere six votes out of 400,000 cast, marking one of the closest House races in modern history. She was seated with the rest of Congress in early January, taking the oath of office and representing the southeastern Iowa district despite Hart moving forward with a petition in the House. Hart asked the House panel in December to probe the results after a recount and certification, bypassing the courts and calling for a hand recount of all votes -- including 22 ballots that were excluded from the official tally. Her legal team centered their case on those excluded ballots, saying that they were legally cast and should be counted and would ultimately hand her a victory if they were included. ""Since Election Day, and throughout this entire process, my mission has been about ensuring the voices of Iowans who followed the law are not silenced. I am saddened that some Iowans’ votes will not count through no fault of their own. The work of ensuring it does not happen again will continue beyond this campaign,"" Hart said in the statement ending her challenge. But a pursuit in Congress was a politically fraught maneuver, with Republicans mounting a pressure campaign against Democrats for trying to reverse the election outcome and framing the challenge as an attempt by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi try to ""steal"" a Republican seat and pad her slim majority. ""The race is over. I understand people get upset when they lose, but the idea that you want to come in and play a political game is concerning to me,"" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said at a press conference in Iowa, just hours before Hart's announcement. ""We have elections and people need to have trust and faith and confidence in their elections,"" Miller-Meeks said earlier on Wednesday alongside McCarthy. ""If six votes aren't enough to win an election, then why are six members on a committee able to overturn an election."" After Hart officially dropped her challenge, McCarthy celebrated Miller-Meeks' victory, saying in a statement, ""Rita Hart and Nancy Pelosi finally heard what many Iowans told me today: Mariannette Miller-Meeks is the duly-elected Congresswoman serving Iowa’s Second Congressional District."" The GOP's efforts to cast Democrats as trying to invalidate certified election results comes after spending months supporting former President Donald Trump's attempt to reverse his electoral defeat last year. McCarthy voted alongside 138 House Republicans against certifying the presidential results from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Democrats, including Pelosi, pushed back by drawing a contrast between Hart's challenge -- which followed a legal process outlined by federal law and focused on 22 ballots to back up their claims -- and Trump's fruitless effort based on unsubstantiated allegations of fraud. Throughout the protracted process, one of the most significant wrinkles for Democrats was within their own ranks, as some moderate members balked at the prospect of overturning the election results if a vote came to the House floor. ""Losing a House election by six votes is painful for Democrats. But overturning it in the House would be even more painful for America. Just because a majority can, does not mean a majority should,"" Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn.,   earlier this month. It's not unusual for an election to be contested before the obscure committee: there have been 110 cases filed since 1933. But overturning an election is a rare outcome: over nearly 90 years, only three of those cases resulted in the declared winner being removed and replaced, according to the committee, and in one, the seat was left vacant. New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of House Democrats' campaign arm who is charged with defending Democrats' majority in next year's midterm elections, said in a statement after Hart's announcement that he respects the former Iowa state senator's decision and pledged that Democrats will continue to fight for voters. ""From the day she announced her candidacy, Rita Hart has shown that she is a tireless advocate for the people of Iowa. I respect her decision and applaud her efforts to ensure that every legal vote was counted in this election. I know her service and commitment to Iowans won't end here,"" Maloney said. ""While Republicans have been throwing up roadblocks to the ballot box at every turn, Democrats will always fight to ensure every American can vote and that every legal vote is counted.""",3

Speaking to reporters after the first day of a two-day virtual meeting of owners, Goodell said: ""All of us in the NFL want to see every one of our fans back. Football is simply not the same without fans, and we expect to have full stadiums in the upcoming season."" Some of that expectation is based on factors beyond the NFL's control. The league never established an attendance cap while playing during the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, deferring instead to individual teams in conjunction with state and local regulations. Attendance dipped more than 90% compared to 2019 and a total of 1.2 million fans were included in attendance counts for the entire regular season and postseason. League revenues fell accordingly. In some cases, the NFL will need local municipalities to sign off on attendance plans in order to fully open up their stadiums for 2021. Vaccine rates might also play a factor. A total of 18 NFL stadiums are in use as mass vaccination sites and to date, 1.5 million shots have been administered at those sites, according to the league. NFL chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills said last week that the league would encourage but not require players, coaches and staff to be vaccinated. The league and the NFL Players Association are continuing to negotiate the terms of the offseason program, which the league told teams would begin April 19. The NFLPA is advocating for a fully virtual offseason, similar to what the league transitioned to in 2020, while owners would like players back in the team facilities for traditional minicamps and OTAs.",2

""I think the level of excitement for me is at an all-time high,"" Drummond told reporters Tuesday over a videoconference call following his first full practice with the team since          . It will be Drummond's first game action since Feb. 12, after which the           took him out of the lineup while trying to find a trade partner to move the nine-year veteran center. While Drummond characterized the long layoff as ""crazy,"" he sounded confident about where his conditioning was at following his first practice session in Los Angeles. ""I felt incredible,"" he said. ""I wasn't winded."" Drummond told the Mason & Ireland Show on ESPN 710 Los Angeles on Monday that he ""lost about 10 to 15 pounds"" during his time away from the court, adding, ""right now, I'm probably in the best shape I can be in."" Drummond's addition to the starting unit calls into question what Gasol's role will be moving forward.           already occupies the backup center position and has been one of the Lakers' most consistent players, averaging 15.2 points on 63.8% and 6.8 rebounds in 25.3 minutes per game. Gasol, who signed to a two-year deal with L.A. in the offseason after the Lakers traded away           and saw           join the           as a free agent, has had a tough first season with the purple and gold. Gasol is averaging career lows in points (4.8), rebounds (3.9) and field goal percentage (40.4%) and recently dealt with contracting COVID-19, which caused him to miss nine straight games. ""Marc's had a difficult run with the health and safety protocols and some other things,"" Vogel said. ""He's loved here. These guys respect him so much. He's been a true pro in handling this. We're going to need all three of our centers throughout this playoff push, this championship run, hopefully. And he's a true pro."" Vogel said he has not had any talks with the 13-year veteran about a potential buyout. Drummond, 27, will be an unrestricted free agent this offseason, and Vogel said the franchise intends to re-sign him. ""That's certainly what we're hopeful for,"" Vogel said. ""The summer will play out, and we'll let that happen when it happens. But we want him to help us during this championship run this season, but we're hopeful that he's a Laker for a long time to come. That's what we're envisioning, that he's gonna be a key piece for us, both in the short term and the long term."" Perhaps planting the seed for a future contract, Lakers governor Jeanie Buss posted a series of photos to her Instagram account on Monday depicting her late father, Dr. Jerry Buss, with former Laker great           and Drummond and herself sharing a similarly warm moment. ""Man, it's an honor,"" Drummond said when asked about continuing the Lakers' lineage of All-Star centers. ""It's an honor to be in this facility, to be able to step onto that court where these legends have played and built such an incredible legacy here in L.A. So, it's a lot of excitement for me to be here.""",2

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/delta-now-opposes-georgias-elections-bill-activists-ramp/story?id=76789220,politics,"Facing mounting pressure, Delta Air Lines' and Coca-Cola's chief executives came out forcefully against    s bill Wednesday, both calling it ""unacceptable"" -- a stark difference from the companies' previous, more muted statements. ""After having time to now fully understand all that is in the bill, coupled with discussions with leaders and employees in the Black community, it's evident that the bill includes provisions that will make it harder for many underrepresented voters, particularly Black voters, to exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives. That is wrong,"" CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo sent to all Delta employees worldwide. His   praised aspects of the new law, and said it ""improved considerably during the legislative process."" Hours later, Coca-Cola's CEO joined Delta's in condemning the legislation, calling it a ""step backwards"" in an interview with CNBC. ""This legislation is wrong and needs to be remedied, and we will continue to advocate for it, both in private and now even more clearly in public,"" Quincy said. ""The reality is many things are improved and done and achieved in private without having to take a public stand, but in this case, it does not work, clearly, and so we're being more forceful in our public position."" Quincy's rebuke went much further than another top Coca-Cola executive's did in a   Monday. Coca-Cola did not take a public stance on the bill before it passed, but Monday's statement said the company was ""disappointed in the outcome."" Since Gov. Brian Kemp signed the Republican-sponsored   into law Thursday evening, voting rights activists from a broad coalition of more than 50 groups have ramped up their   Georgia-based businesses. Some leaders are even calling for boycotts. LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter -- one of the coalition groups leading on this issue -- told ABC News Wednesday she was glad that Delta and Coca-Cola changed their stance, and while she said the work is harder now because the bill has passed, she believes these corporations have the ""political muscle"" to make a difference not just in Georgia, but nationwide. ""I'm hoping that they really do recognize ... that not coming out earlier was a missed opportunity, but that in fact they have an opportunity now,"" Brown said. ""(They can) send a clear message that as a company, they adamantly stand against the bills in Georgia and all bills that seek to suppress the vote, and that they're going to use their political capital and leverage to actually prevent voter suppression and stand for democracy."" Delta and Coca-Cola's repositioning also comes as 72 Black executives penned an open letter, which ran as a full-page ad in Wednesday's  , calling on corporate America  to stand in public opposition to any legislation that would restrict voting access, and specifically, Black voters' access to the ballot. ""Make no mistake, we have seen this playbook before,"" the letter read. ""As Black business leaders, we cannot sit silently in the face of this gathering threat to our nation's democratic values and allow the fundamental right of Americans, to cast their votes for whomever they choose, to be trampled upon yet again."" Before the Georgia bill passed, activists had called on major corporations based in the Peach State to publicly oppose the omnibus elections bills being considered by the General Assembly, which they said was directly aimed at suppressing Black voters and other historically disenfranchised communities. But most corporations did not, instead opting to issue general statements supporting fair, accessible and secure elections. Delta and Coca-Cola received much of the post-signing blowback. Wednesday morning, before the executives articulated clearer positions against the bill, Hannah Gebresilassie, a co-founder of #ProtectTheVoteGA, told ABC News that both companies' ""watered-down statements"" were ""extremely disappointing."" ""We expect them to stand up for people across this nation, when injustices are facing our lives,"" Gebresilassie said. ""We want to see Coca-Cola and Delta put their money where their mouth is. Y'all better be helping pay for voter mobilization efforts in the next few months because we have a lot of educating to do with this bill being passed."" On Wednesday afternoon, a group of voters, Black church leaders and activists from Black Voters Matter, the New Georgia Project Action Fund and #ProtectTheVoteGA held a rally in front of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, whose president and CEO   of support for several provisions of the bill, but recognized that ""concerns remain."" Despite the rain, the demonstrators showed up to demand accountability from business leaders on the issue of voting rights. Attendees handed out water to people walking in and out of the building, which under the new elections law volunteers can no longer do for voters waiting in sometimes hours-long lines. Other provisions in the bill that activists have blasted include a shortened early voting period for runoffs, a ban on out-of-precinct voting until 5 p.m., limitations on ballot drop box accessibility and the new ability for voters to make an unlimited number of challenges to other voters' eligibility. Some of the same Georgia corporations being targeted over the elections law responded stood united with the Black Lives Matter movement in the summer of 2020, when activists and allies protested against racial injustice following George Floyd's death in police custody. Both Coca-Cola and Delta came out in support of that racial reckoning. A ""Black Lives Matter""   at Delta's headquarters. Coca-Cola made a racial equity commitment plan, and a   is still on the company's Twitter account. ""They need to understand how strong the correlation is, right? If you're saying Black lives matter, you also need to say that Black votes matter,"" Crystal Greer, the other co-founder of #ProtectTheVoteGA, told ABC News. Brown said companies joining the movement that followed Floyd's death was a ""positive move forward,"" but she said now, companies who did so need to make clear that it was not a ""marketing exploitation opportunity."" ""It is one thing to in the heat of the moment, to say that I stand and I acknowledge this is wrong (but) I think it also has to be more than transactional. It has to be a transformative change,"" Brown said. ""What are their values as companies around racial justice and racial equity? What are they willing to give, but what are they willing to give up?""",3

Suggs said he'd planned to congratulate Bueckers -- the two are former high school stars from Minnesota -- for the achievement but instead left their conversation feeling inspired for his regional final matchup the following night. ""Last night, [Bueckers] said some things that really helped me,"" said Suggs, who finished with 18 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists in his team's 85-66 win over USC in the Elite Eight. ""I've been kind of struggling, trying to get my footing in these tournament games. Of course, seeing her go out there and play great like she did and then talking afterward ... she kind of said some words, it kind of got me uplifted, got me going. Definitely helped tonight."" Suggs entered Tuesday's game with 14 turnovers combined in his three previous contests. He finished with three against USC, his lowest tally in the NCAA tournament. While he showed poise in the Elite Eight matchup, he lacked that calm watching Bueckers' game on Monday. Suggs said he was ""extremely nervous"" and ""pacing back and forth"" until the final buzzer. ""I couldn't sit down,"" he said. Now, Suggs and Gonzaga will take the next step toward completing the first perfect season since the 1975-76           achieved the feat. Since then, the four teams that entered the NCAA tournament with a perfect record -- Indiana State in 1979, UNLV in 1991, Wichita State in 2014 and Kentucky in 2015 -- failed to win the national championship. But coach Mark Few said his team is not focused on history. He said he wanted it to celebrate its Elite Eight victory and then move on to its next game against UCLA. ""Everyone wants us to keep moving forward, but that's not how we roll,"" he said after the game. ""This is a heck of an accomplishment. We're going to take it and savor it for what it is. That doesn't lessen our desire to win this game, the next game or win two more games. We're wise enough to know these are really, really special times. These are great accomplishments, and they need to be celebrated. That's how we're approaching it right now. Enjoying the heck out of it."" Tuesday's game was an impressive showing by the Bulldogs against a USC squad that had dominated Kansas and Oregon on its way to the Elite Eight. But a Gonzaga team that made 50% of its shots and outscored USC 46-32 in the paint overwhelmed the Trojans. Now, the pursuit of perfection continues. Suggs entered the postgame news conference with a souvenir around his neck: Few had given him the largest piece of the net he cut down after Tuesday's win. Suggs said he wasn't sure if he was supposed to wear it around, but Few told him to ""keep it."" While the team isn't looking too far ahead, Suggs said it's difficult to avoid considering the possibility of an undefeated season. ""It's hard not to think about it,"" Suggs said. ""We try to keep our minds off of it and keep focused on the task at hand. It's a great accomplishment to be mentioned with those teams because they're amazing. Again, we just come in every day to play to the Gonzaga standard and for each other. I mean, this is the result that we get from that.""",2

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/ucla-bruins-outlast-michigan-wolverines-reach-final-ncaa/story?id=76783042,sports,"INDIANAPOLIS -- First Four to Final Four. , which was one of the last four at-large teams selected to the NCAA tournament and earned an 11-seed, became the first team since VCU in 2011 to advance from the First Four to the Final Four, holding on to upset top-seeded           51-49 on Tuesday night. The Bruins move on to face overall No. 1 seed            on Saturday. ""Unreal, man. Unreal. I love every single one of these guys,"" UCLA guard           said. ""It's incredible, man. Surreal. Surreal. Something growing up, you just dream about. And to do it with such an amazing group of guys, such incredible staff, such incredible coaches, makes it just so wonderful. It's beautiful. It's beautiful sharing this moment with your brothers and just great, great people. Incredible."" The Bruins led for most of the final 25 minutes of the game, but a missed           3-pointer in the final minute and Juzang going 1-for-2 from the free throw line with six seconds remaining opened the door for Michigan. The Wolverines first went to           with 11 seconds left, but he air-balled the go-ahead 3-point attempt. After Juzang missed his second free throw, Michigan's           had a pull-up 3-pointer rim out, and Wagner's desperation 3 at the buzzer didn't fall either. ""We got the look, got the shot that we wanted,"" Michigan coach Juwan Howard said. ""Unfortunately there's not much you can do with 0.5 seconds, but that shot was a nice little heave. Unfortunately it just didn't go in. Before that we got an open look and just fell short, but overall, I love the fact how our guys executed down the stretch."" Juzang was UCLA's main source of offense for most of Tuesday night, scoring 14 of the Bruins' first 16 points and finishing with 28 points. He left briefly after landing awkwardly following a rebound, but he got his right ankle retaped and reentered the game. Juzang single-handedly kept UCLA in the game during the opening stretch when Michigan had a seven-point lead and the Bruins couldn't get anything going on the offensive end. Juzang, combined with a terrific game plan from Cronin, enabled UCLA to claw back into the game and enter halftime with a four-point cushion. ""Just approached it like another game,"" Juzang said. ""We've been super locked into this tournament. As a player, you don't like to add pressure to yourself. I know the whole team was just worried about 'we're going to leave it out there on the floor and we're going to give it everything we've got.' I mean, the shots just happened to go in and teammates were finding me."" Cronin rotated           and           at the center position, helping limit Michigan big man            on the interior. The Bruins' defense forced Michigan to create offense in isolation situations, with the Wolverines getting very little from off-ball movement. And, once again, the pace of the game was being played in UCLA's favor. Unfortunately for Michigan, none of that changed in the second half. UCLA jumped out to a nine-point lead before Juzang hurt his ankle and Michigan regained the momentum. The Wolverines took a one-point lead on two occasions, but UCLA -- like it did after Alabama's           sent Sunday's game to overtime with a buzzer-beating 3 -- took its punches and fought back. ""To find a way to beat them with defense the way we did tonight, obviously extremely proud of our team,"" Cronin said. ""It was just resilience. ... I think that stat sheet can get crumbled up tonight."" When Cronin was picked to replace Steve Alford the day after the 2019 national championship game, it wasn't a universally acclaimed hire. There were questions about Cronin's fit, not only for a Midwest native moving to the West Coast, but in terms of how the grind-it-out style he used at Cincinnati would work at a blueblood school like UCLA. ""April 9th, 2019, I told you, I spell fun W-I-N,"" Cronin said. ""You have to find a way to win, and these guys are having the most fun they have ever had in their life back in that locker room because they won. I told them I was going to teach them how to win."" The Bruins finished strong in Cronin's first season and were a bubble team entering the final days of the 2019-20 season before the NCAA tournament was canceled. And there was plenty of optimism entering year two, before bad luck hit Westwood.

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/msg-barclays-center-welcoming-fully-vaccinated-fans-back/story?id=76635382,sports,"Across the country, tens of millions of Americans received a tangible bill of   following their vaccinations against the  . And in New York's biggest arenas, that vaccination card will be their ticket back to indoor events. This week, Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center will be the first major indoor sports venues to allow fans who show proof of full vaccination to purchase tickets to NBA and NHL games, albeit with limited seating and a mask mandate. Ben Diamond, a Knicks and Rangers fan who started the blog  , that has chronicled the city's sports fans' thoughts and experiences during the pandemic, told ABC News that he and other fans were relieved when the arena announced the plan. ""I'd personally feel better going to the Garden if I was fully vaccinated, and knew that others had their shots,"" said Diamond, 25, who received his first vaccine shot last week. Public health experts and business experts predict that more indoor businesses will ask for vaccination confirmations from customers as more locations begin reopening. However, they warned that such a program would not immediately bring their businesses back to pre-pandemic times, as millions of Americans are still waiting for their shots and thousands of new COVID-19 cases are still recorded daily. Dr. Dean Winslow, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Health Care, told ABC News that MSG and Barclays Center's strategy is effective since it doesn't rely heavily on vaccination rates to safely allow fans inside. The arenas are only at 10% capacity, and any ticket buyer that is not 14 days out of their second shot will have to present a negative   test, according to  . All fans must also adhere to the mask mandate, regardless of their vaccination status. ""I do think people do have to understand that any time you have to gather indoors, outside of your immediate family, you are assuming a risk, but the risk [at MSG] is manageable,"" Winslow told ABC News. Winslow said other sports locations will likely be instituting similar policies during the spring and summer if they want to welcome their fans back safely -- but it may take time. ""Right now, with such a small percentage vaccinated, it's going to be a few months before you see these policies adopted on a widespread basis,"" he predicted. Lauren Bock Mullins, an assistant professor of management at the College of Staten Island, told ABC News the policy will likely go beyond sporting events. Indoor businesses that have been most impacted by the pandemic, such as movie theaters, concert halls, shops and restaurants, have been yearning to get their customers back without spreading the virus, she said. In many cities and towns, those businesses have reopened and have strict health policies, including limited seating and mask mandates. Mullins said a proof of vaccination option may be used by bigger businesses and chains first, but smaller mom-and-pops will be keeping their eyes on the plan's effectiveness. ""If they do it well, I don't see why others would not want to follow suit,"" Mullins told ABC News. Public health experts warned that businesses that do impose a policy that allows for more vaccinated customers to enter a venue need to be careful. Philip Alcabes, the director of the public health program at Hunter College, said that the country's vaccination rate is moving at a good pace nationally, but there are still some counties that are lagging behind, particularly in lower-income and minority neighborhoods. Proof of vaccination policies, at this point, would accentuate the vaccine inequality on an economic level, Alcabes said. ""These sorts of systems that require people to show proof of something always invite opportunities to have inequities,"" Alcabes told ABC News. The professor added that there is still the threat of rising cases from the COVID-19 variants, and people need to stick to social distancing, even if they already received their shots, until more people are vaccinated. Alcabes said if indoor businesses do start implementing the proof of vaccination policy, people who have been hesitant to get the vaccine may do so, if only to begin resuming their normal lives. Diamond said he has heard from a lot of sports fans in the New York area who are more than willing to get their shots and return to their pre-pandemic activities. He said fans feel a sense of appreciation and acknowledgment when they see rewards being offered to those getting vaccinated. ""Some fans will say, 'OK I don't want to miss out on this,'"" Diamond said. ""They feel they've done a good job being safe.""",5

Lockett was entering the final season of a three-year, $31.8 million extension he signed in 2018. He has had his three best seasons since then, with 28 receiving touchdowns (fifth among NFL wide receivers) and 3,076 yards (13th). The $17.3 million new-money average in Lockett's extension ranks 10th among NFL wide receivers, according to Spotrac.com. Lockett, 28, was a third-round pick by Seattle in 2015. He made the Pro Bowl and was a first-team All-Pro as a returner in his rookie season, then came back from a compound leg fracture late in the 2016 season to start every game in 2017. He has since supplanted the retired Doug Baldwin as Seattle's No. 1 receiver. Last season, Lockett and           became only the second pair of Seahawks receivers in team history to each top 1,000 yards in the same year. With Metcalf a year away from becoming eligible for what is expected to be a massive payday, there was no guarantee that Seattle would reinvest in Lockett with a third contract. Lockett was set to have the third-largest cap hit of any Seahawks player in 2021 at $14.95 million. His extension lowers that number to around $7 million, a source told ESPN. That gives Seattle some needed breathing room against the cap and is one reason for the timing of Lockett's extension, which comes much earlier in the offseason than when the Seahawks typically do new deals for players who are under contract. Quarterback           and Baldwin celebrated Lockett's extension on Twitter: Lockett has shown a          .

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/supreme-court-questions-validity-amateurism-ncaas-business-model/story?id=76794069,sports,"The justices of the Supreme Court of the United States questioned whether amateurism is an essential part of the NCAA's business model Wednesday during a landmark hearing for the future of college sports while also expressing concerns about starting a slippery slope of judicial rulings that could lead to the destruction of an American tradition. The Supreme Court heard more than 90 minutes of oral arguments Wednesday morning in the NCAA v. Alston case, the first time the nation's highest court has weighed in on the business of college sports in nearly four decades. The question in front of the court is whether the NCAA deserves special relief from normal antitrust rules in order to protect its educational mission and preserve a tradition of amateurism in college sports. The court is expected to make a ruling sometime in late spring or early summer. A federal district court judge decided in her ruling in the Alston case in 2020 that the limits NCAA member schools mutually agree to place on what each school can provide to its athletes in compensation are illegal. The judge's ruling opens the door for athletes to receive unlimited benefits as long as they are related in some way to education. That includes items such as classroom equipment, study abroad travel, funding for post-graduation internships and cash payments for academic achievements. The NCAA appealed the judge's ruling, arguing that the loose guidelines of education-related benefits could be exploited in a way that will blur the lines between college sports and professional leagues. ""Whatever their labels, these new allowances are akin to professional salaries,"" said Seth Waxman, the NCAA's lead attorney, during his opening arguments Wednesday. Waxman and the NCAA claim that the unpaid status of college athletes is a key part of their appeal to consumers. Waxman says that because amateurism is the characteristic that sets the NCAA apart from others in the marketplace of sports entertainment, the organization should get to decide how to define the line between amateurs and professionals. He said that the ruling in district court amounted to a judge micromanaging the NCAA's business. Plaintiff's attorney Jeffrey Kessler and several of the justices pushed back on the idea that providing athletes with money would cause the public to lose interest in college sports. ""The courts are appropriately focused on that, but we believe nothing bad will happen,"" Kessler told ESPN on Wednesday afternoon. ""Just like nothing bad happened after the O'Bannon case they lost. Nothing bad happened after the Board of Regents case they lost. Nothing bad happened after the NCAA v. Law case that they lost. They always warn, the NCAA, that this will be the thing that ruins college sports. And what we find instead is that when they're forced to comply with the law it actually helps college sports."" Justice Samuel Alito pointed out that athletes already receive some payment in the form of scholarships, stipends and other benefits and that those allowances have not caused a downturn in TV ratings or ticket sales. Waxman said the NCAA defines payment as any compensation that goes beyond ""reasonable and necessary expenses to obtain an education."" Justice Amy Coney Barrett later questioned why the NCAA should get to decide how to define what it means for an athlete to be paid. Several justices also expressed skepticism about the NCAA's ""high-minded"" claims about the importance of preserving amateurism. Justice Elena Kagan asked why the court shouldn't see the NCAA as an organization that has undisputed power over its market and uses the idea of amateurism to fix the price of labor. Kagan said that while amateurism may have been created more than a century ago to protect an institution that provides social value, that doesn't mean that is its function today. ""You can only ride on the history for so long. A great deal has changed since 100 years ago in the way student-athletes are treated,"" Kagan said. ""A great deal has changed [since 1985], let alone 100 years ago. I guess it doesn't move me all that much that there is a history to this."" Later, when questioning the plaintiff's case, Kagan asked whether the incremental increase in what athletes are allowed to make will lead to more litigation in the future. She echoed the concern of several justices that their ruling in the Alston case would be the first step in a series of lawsuits that steadily chip away at the NCAA's rules until college sports are clearly professional by anyone's definition. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wondered what the ""end game"" would be for the plaintiffs to feel fully satisfied in the future. Kagan referred to it as the ""floodgates argument."" ""What's next?"" she asked. ""Is it going to go up and up and up and pretty soon it will just be a regular labor market?"" Justice Stephen Breyer was the most adamantly opposed of his colleagues to treating college sports like other industries. ""I think if we really have a case here, it's a tough case for me,"" Breyer said. ""This is not an ordinary product. This is an effort to bring into the world something that has brought joy and all kinds of things to millions and millions of people, and it's only partly economic. OK, so, I worry a lot about judges getting into the business of deciding how amateur sports should be run."" Breyer argued that even if consumer demand wasn't significantly harmed by providing more compensation to athletes, there were other implications to changing the NCAA's rules that were worth considering. He cited the administrative burden on colleges and universities to implement these new rules as one example. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who spoke at the hearing in support of the plaintiff's side, said that the antitrust issue in front of the court was the only argument for it to consider. She said it was up to Congress and state legislators, not the judicial branch, to decide whether other problems that might come from changing the NCAA rules are worth the government's intervention. Prelogar petitioned to speak at the hearing in a somewhat unusual move in order to share the Department of Justice's thoughts on amateurism rules and how they fit into antitrust law. She said that amateurism was relevant in the case only to the extent that it impacts the NCAA's business model. She urged the justices to affirm the lower court's decision, saying that ""there is no pro-competitive justification to deprive athletes to get benefits through ordinary competition.""",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wr-jamarr-chase-wouldnt-mind-reunion-cincinnati-bengals/story?id=76795081,sports,"Wide receiver           , who opted out of his final season at           before turning pro, says he is open to a reunion with his former teammate and quarterback           in          . ""I wouldn't mind going back with Joe,"" Chase said Wednesday. ""If we go back together, we're trying to do nothing but get back our chemistry and have some more fun."" Cincinnati, which selected Burrow No. 1 overall last year, owns the fifth pick in this year's           and Chase said he has spoken with the Bengals during the pre-draft process. ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. lists Chase as the No. 2 wide receiver in the draft, behind          's          , and the No. 4 overall prospect. In January, Burrow was asked about Chase and the possibility of getting back together. He too said he ""wouldn't mind"" reconnecting. ""That's a really good player. It's pretty easy to throw to him when he has 5 yards of separation every snap,"" Burrow said. ""He's an exciting player and a great guy and a friend as well. He was fun to play with."" With Burrow as his quarterback, Chase had 84 catches for 1,780 yards and 20 touchdowns in 2019 and won the Biletnikoff Award, given to the nation's top receiver. Chase told the SEC Network that he would let his results and film from his superb 2019 season speak for him when asked to make his pitch as the top wide receiver in this year's draft class. ""It's very important for me [to be the first receiver picked], not just because I dreamed of it, but I worked my butt off to get here,"" Chase said. ""I don't want nobody to take that from me. I'm not letting anyone take it from me. So I'm gonna keep working."" Chase joined a number of his former LSU teammates and ran an unofficial 4.38-second 40-yard dash during the Tigers' pro day on Wednesday. He also posted an 11-foot standing broad jump and a 41-inch vertical jump. ""I would say I kind of surprised myself,"" Chase said of his 40 time. ""I was going for a low 4.4, but last night I was feeling good about my starts and felt like I could get a 4.3 this morning. And I did it."" Chase wasn't the only potential first-round receiver to take part in the pro day.          , whom Kiper rates as the sixth-best receiver in the draft, ran an unofficial 4.38-second 40-yard dash as well. Marshall appeared in seven games, catching 48 passes for 731 yards and 10 touchdowns, before opting out last season.",2
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/ncaa-president-mark-emmert-admits-inequality-womens-basketball/story?id=76791226,sports,"NCAA president Mark Emmert on Wednesday continued to apologize for the inequities between the men's and women's basketball tournaments that were exposed earlier this month, conceding, ""we let them down,"" but he added that the women's basketball community has to determine specific improvements it wants to ""pick up and run with"" as the sport moves forward. A recent point of debate has been branding differences, as the March Madness slogan isn't used in conjunction with the women's tournament and the Final Fours are differentiated by the use of ""Women's"" preceding the Final Four logo. While Emmert said he is committed to ""making sure that we use the marks of the NCAA as effectively as we can in promoting women's basketball,"" he added that ""those are debates for marketing people and those who want to promote the game."" ""There's no reason at all why those two logos can't be whatever the women's side wants,"" Emmert said. ""The women's staff are a part of the NCAA. They're part of my national office. We all work and live in the same building. This is not somebody against the NCAA. It's part of the NCAA. The March Madness logo can -- if the women's committee and the women's community wants it used -- there's no reason they can't use it. ""Similarly, 'Final Four' is used by both, and whether or not one wants to use the logo with a gender identifier is up to the committee, and they can certainly do whatever they'd like to do with those things. So, yes, I'm fully committed to doing that."" Emmert addressed the media for about 30 minutes Wednesday ahead of the          . While he spoke about a variety of topics, the focus continued to be on gender-equity issues, which were again pushed to the forefront after images surfaced on social media showing stark differences between the men's and women's weight rooms, their meals and the so-called ""swag bags."" Most of those issues have been resolved, but the bigger-picture topics -- which have been bubbling within the women's game for decades -- have prompted the NCAA to hire a New York-based law firm to conduct an external review into gender equity for all of the NCAA-sponsored championships. ""When you lay the men's and women's championships side by side, as has been made clear over the past weeks, it is pretty self-evident that we dropped the ball in supporting our women's athletes, and we can't do that,"" Emmert said. ""That's a failure that should not exist."" Emmert said the NCAA needs to use what happened in San Antonio ""as a pivot point, an inflection point to say: What do we need to do better? How do we make up for those shortcomings from this day going on and create the kind of gender equity that we all talk about ... to make sure it's a reality, not just language?"" The NCAA has to make sure its 90 championships -- 45 of which are women's events -- are ""the pinnacle, the exemplar of how we treat men and women in those championships,"" Emmert said. ""That is not what we did here,"" he said. ""We are -- I am -- sorry for that. That is something that we should never have allowed to happen. I get that. So does everyone now."" Asked why it has taken so long to address many of the same issues that were raised in a 2013 report prepared for the NCAA by current Big East commissioner Val Ackerman, Emmert pointed to another NCAA study done about two years ago but ultimately said ""there's no excuse."" ""Those have been and continue to be really heavily discussed,"" Emmert said. ""I think they've led to positive changes around women's basketball, but clearly too little has been done and not enough has been executed on them. The women's basketball community first and foremost also has to determine which parts of those recommendations, like in Val's or anybody else's white paper, that they want to pick up and run with. ""There's no excuse other than we need to do better and we need to get the commitment of all of our governance structure to get on with it. That's what we're doing now. That's why we're doing our review, and that's why I want to work with the coaches' association and others to resolve those problems."" The Women's Basketball Coaches Association on Tuesday sent a letter to Emmert saying that the NCAA's external review was ""insufficient to meet the needs of the WBCA's member coaches."" In the letter, which was obtained by ESPN, the WBCA instead asked for an independent ""commission on gender inequity in college sports"" to be led by individuals chosen by the WBCA and NCAA. ""WBCA is a critical partner,"" Emmert said. ""They're the experts on women's basketball. They have more knowledge and understanding of the game and what's been going on for a long time than anybody else. They have to be an essential part of understanding all of this."" Emmert, NCAA vice president for basketball Dan Gavitt and vice president for women's basketball Lynn Holzman were on a Zoom call with WBCA members shortly after Emmert spoke with the media, with          's Dawn Staley,          's Cori Close,          's Nell Fortner,          's Geno Auriemma and former           coach Muffet McGraw asking questions about what happened with the inequities with this year's tournament and with the sport in general. Asked by Close about the size of the main staffs who work on the championships, Gavitt said it was 12 for the men and six for the women. He said in retrospect that he didn't give enough weight to the fact that the men are used to a tournament in which the NCAA manages neutral-site venues for all rounds, whereas the women normally rely on the 16 host schools to manage the early rounds. With the coronavirus pandemic forcing the entire women's tournament to the San Antonio area, there was more for the NCAA to manage this year. ""I wish I'd realized earlier on that Lynn needed a lot more bodies to pull this off,"" Gavitt said, while acknowledging that Holzman had requested additional staff. ""This is a very different format for both championships, but even more for the women's championship."" Fortner, who noted the women's tournament's growth over the years, questioned why the signage, logos and courts for the women's tournament didn't use the ""March Madness"" moniker or tap into the ways the men's tournament is branded as an iconic sports event. Holzman said they didn't have special courts at early-round women's sites at Texas, Texas State, UTSA and Saint Mary's because such courts weren't previously produced or prioritized. The coaches pointed out that it made those games appear on television to be average games rather than NCAA tournament games. ""I do believe that there needs to be this bigger branding strategy discussion,"" Holzman said. ""There clearly the last few years have been some other conversations that we need to be having together, from the outset, with men's basketball about what is right for the game of basketball in college. I expect we're going to see some pretty substantive changes here in order to elevate the championship where it needs to be at."" Asked in the media session whether there was anything he wishes he would have done differently in his response to the tournament differences, Emmert replied, ""There always is. ""Those things just shouldn't happen. We could have and should have avoided them, and we didn't. That's a miss on my part. That's a miss on everybody's part. We were really focused on making sure we could get through this during the pandemic, and we weren't as focused on the kind of equity that we needed. The thing I'm most regretful for is that we didn't catch it up front. ""To have this incredible event marred by these incidences is just wrenching. Anything we could have done to avoid that I would have happily done and obviously wish we had. These athletes deserve that. They've earned it, they deserve it. We let them down, and that shouldn't have occurred.""",2

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/nfl-owners-approve-daniel-snyders-buyout-washington-football/story?id=76797748,sports," owner Daniel Snyder's family has gained complete control of the franchise for the first time since buying it more than two decades ago. NFL owners unanimously approved Snyder's purchase of the remaining 40.5% of the Washington Football Team from the franchise's minority owners, a source told ESPN. The NFL also approved a $450 million debt waiver as well as the $875 million sale. Snyder bought out his three longtime minority investors, Fred Smith, Dwight Schar and Robert Rothman, who have been with Snyder since 2003. Before the purchase, Snyder had owned 40.459% of the team, with his mother, Arlette, owning 6.5% and his sister, Michele, owning 12.55%. Now the family owns 100% of the franchise, which Snyder bought in 1999. Snyder would have to repay the debt by 2028. The Washington Post reported in November that a group of investors had offered the minority shareholders $900 million to sell but that Snyder blocked the move. The battle among the minority owners and Snyder spilled into the public eye this summer and continued into the winter, with numerous court filings as the sides accused each other of bad-faith dealings and spreading misinformation. According to ESPN's Seth Wickersham, the sale will end the dispute between Snyder and his former co-owners. Washington also is in the middle of a rebrand, having decided to retire its previous name last summer. It hasn't yet settled on a new name or logo, but there will be a permanent one in place for the 2022 season. It will continue as the Washington Football Team this season. The organization set out to improve its culture shortly after the Post's articles. Among other moves, it hired Jason Wright as the NFL's first Black team president and Julie Donaldson as the senior vice president of media and the first woman to be part of an NFL team's radio broadcast. Washington also remains under an independent investigation by attorney Beth Wilkinson, stemming from a number of sexual harassment allegations by previous employees over a 15-year period. The investigation remains ongoing. On a videoconference call,           owner John Mara was asked whether the vote signaled confidence that Snyder would be found of no wrongdoing in the investigation. Mara declined comment on that aspect, saying he's not involved at all in the investigation, but said, ""I'm just glad it was settled between Dan and the minority partners so they can move ahead.""",1
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/washington-nationals-player-tests-positive-covid-19-teammates/story?id=76797017,sports,"The           will be down five players and a staff member for Opening Day after a player tested positive for COVID-19, general manager Mike Rizzo said Wednesday. ""We are following MLB protocols and CDC protocols and working closely with the league to determine our next steps,"" Rizzo said. ""It will be a lot of balls in the air until then."" The positive result came from a test conducted Monday while the Nationals were still in Florida for spring training. Word of the test result came a little after 1 a.m. Wednesday, after the team had traveled home to Washington, where it is scheduled to host the           on Thursday night for Opening Day. The flight home was where there was close contact between the player who tested positive and the four teammates and staff member who are now quarantining. All six individuals will miss Thursday's opener, but their status after that is unclear. Per MLB's health and safety protocols for 2021, the player who tested positive will be required to isolate for a minimum of 10 days, receive appropriate care and monitoring from the club medical staff, and be cleared by baseball's joint COVID-19 committee and the individual's team physician following a mandatory cardiac evaluation and a determination that the individual no longer presents a risk of infection to others. Rizzo did not identify any of the six members of the organization who are involved. ""We'll have some roster decisions to make depending on how this all shakes out before Opening Day,"" Rizzo said. ""This is just a small blip on our radar screen. We're going to handle it and take it in stride."" The Nationals -- who had planned to have a workout at their stadium on Wednesday before it was called off because of rain -- did not have a single player test positive during their six weeks of spring training camp in West Palm Beach, Florida. The team has not yet been vaccinated. Rizzo said he has received one shot of the vaccine and will advise players to get it as soon as they are eligible but will leave the decision up to them. Thursday's starting pitcher,          , was not on the team flight and traveled separately with his family. He said having dealt with the pandemic last season has the team more prepared for events like what happened Wednesday. ""There's less unknowns,"" Scherzer told MLB on ESPN Radio. ""... 2020 was a good learning experience for all of us in knowing that, 'Hey, once it starts going, you kind of know how this ends.' Now we have that information; it's not, I would say, last year when you started hearing a lot more positive tests going around that you just felt like it was way more widespread. Hopefully this one is contained as well as we can because of all of the protocols we have in place now. You know everything that we do, hopefully we contained it and hopefully it's not a big deal."" Rizzo said the team underwent a new round of COVID-19 tests Wednesday, as was previously scheduled -- a combination of rapid tests and MLB-mandated saliva tests. He noted that there are players available to be brought in from the club's alternate training site in Fredericksburg, Virginia. ""This is the reason you have 60 good players in the organization, to kind of prepare for these type of ... scenarios,'' he said.",2
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/york-giants-owner-john-mara-spending-big-money/story?id=76799377,sports," co-owner John Mara approved of the team spending more money this offseason as it handed out more than $100 million in guaranteed money. But without saying general manager Dave Gettleman's job is in jeopardy, Mara also made it clear what he expects in return. ""It's time for us to start winning,"" Mara told reporters via videoconference after the conclusion of the NFL owners meetings Wednesday. ""That's one of the reasons we spent the money we did."" To that end, Mara and the Giants re-signed defensive lineman           and signed receiver           and cornerback           . All totaled, New York committed $110 million in guaranteed money to this trio. It represents a pivot for a team that had not spent big in free agency in recent years. But Mara said the Giants wanted to surround quarterback           with more talent. Mostly, though, he wants to do something they haven't done recently: win. The Giants have posted losing seasons in seven of the past eight years. After going 11-5 in 2016, New York has gone a combined 18-46. That ties them with the           for the NFL's worst record during this span. ""It's been a very difficult four- or five-year period for us,"" Mara said. ""I'm tired of the losing and having a postseason press conference trying to explain what went wrong and why I think we're making progress. ""I think we're moving in the right direction, but it's been brutal the last few years. We're looking forward to turning it around and not having to make excuses for why we haven't done it."" New York hopes Golladay, new tight end           ($12 million) and speedy receiver           ($2.5 million) can help invigorate the offense. The return of running back           should help, as well. But the additional help means Jones needs to produce. He threw 11 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions in 14 games last year. In two seasons, he has thrown a combined 35 touchdowns and 22 picks while the Giants are 8-18 with him as a starter. Mara said he wouldn't put any benchmarks on Jones to measure his improvement -- or to gauge his team's desire to keep him around. ""We think the world of Daniel,"" Mara said. ""We want to see him take the next step. I don't have any specific benchmarks other than, let's win some more games. He'll have a better team around him this year than he's had in previous years, so we certainly expect him to take that next step. I want to see him continue to improve because I do think he has what it takes to be a long-term winner in this league."" Mara pointed to coach Joe Judge as one reason he's optimistic. New York finished 6-10 in Judge's first year, a two-game improvement over 2019. But Mara said it's ""definitely"" a better locker room than it has been in a while and that players believe in Judge. ""We won only six games last year, but I sensed just a different feeling from the players. They believe in his message. You could see that in team meetings. You could see that on the practice field and you could see in their effort. Now is the time to start winning more games,"" he said. That's partly why Mara wasn't about to put Gettleman on the so-called hot seat in March, despite a 15-33 record since his hiring in 2018. ""I'm not going to speculate on that right now,"" Mara said. ""Let's see how the season plays out. I have more confidence going into this season than I've had in previous years. Hopefully the money that we spent and given the draft we expect to have, we'll have a better team on the field this year. Mara said the Giants didn't plan on spending so much money this offseason, but said the right opportunities presented themselves with Golladay and Jackson. He said he talked to Golladay before he signed, trying to sell him on doing so, but added by that time the receiver's mind was probably made up. It also mattered that Golladay, 27, and Jackson, 25, were both young and played positions of need. Williams is 26. ""You can't do that every year, but when the opportunity presents itself you have to seize it,"" Mara said. ""That's what we did this year. We think it will pay off. We're certainly not a finished product by any stretch of the imagination, but I do like the direction that we're going."" One thing the spending did prevent: an extension for Barkley, who is coming off a torn ACL. But he's entering his fourth season and New York can pick up his fifth-year option, so there's time for an extension to happen. Mara said he does want to get one done eventually. ""We fully expect him to be as good as new,"" Mara said. ""If anybody is going to spend 100% of his efforts to rehab it will be Saquon. But we're not in any hurry to do that particularly after the money we just spent. But I said it at the end of the season and I'll say it again: We hope he's going to be a Giant for life. At the appropriate time we'll start those discussions.""",2
https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/jj-redick-sounds-off-orleans-pelicans-front-offices/story?id=76795341,sports," criticized the          ' front office for the way it handled his trade to the           at last week's NBA trade deadline, saying executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin ""did not honor his word"" to help put Redick in a favorable situation where he would be closer to his family. Redick, who signed a two-year, $26.5 million deal with the Pelicans as a free agent in the summer of 2019, said on his ""The Old Man & the Three"" podcast, which was released Wednesday, that he first requested to be dealt last November for several reasons. One reason was a desire to be closer to his family in Brooklyn, where his son was starting kindergarten and would not be able to travel to New Orleans because of quarantine rules at the school. Another reason was the Pelicans trading away guard          , who Redick said was one of the main reasons he wanted to play in New Orleans in the first place. He expressed all of this to Griffin and general manager Trajan Langdon. Redick said that while his agent handled things, he also talked with Griffin personally. ""I talked to Griff. I talked to Trajan. Griff basically says to me, 'Come down for a month. If you still want to be traded, I give you my word, I'll get you to a situation that you like.' We had four subsequent conversations,"" Redick said on the podcast. ""Again, my agent talked to them. But I'm talking to Griff directly. Griff and I had a personal relationship. ""Obviously, he did not honor his word."" When asked specifically by podcast co-host Tommy Alter if he thinks players will be able to trust the Pelicans' front office moving forward, Redick was blunt. ""I don't think you're going to get honesty from that front office, just objectively speaking,"" Reddick said. ""That's not an opinion -- I just don't think you're going to get that. I don't think what happened with me is necessarily an isolated incident either. But I do think across the league, front offices, they act in their best interest. I get that. I understand that. ""Truthfully -- and it's hard for me to admit this -- I think I was a little naive in thinking that because I was in Year 15, and I had at least attempted to do things right throughout my career and I honored my end of the bargain ... But in terms of this front office, yeah, it's not something where I would expect certainly the agents that worked on this with me to ever trust that front office again."" Redick said it was his understanding that once he was not dealt at the aggregate deadline on Feb. 2, he would be bought out and allowed to go to a team of his choosing. Redick wanted to be dealt to a team in the Northeast, where he could be closer to his family in Brooklyn. ""I look at the buyout situation not as, 'Oh, I'm going to be bought out and go to [the] Brooklyn [Nets],'"" he said. ""I just wanted to be able to, on an off day, go see my family and be within driving distance."" Redick, 36, said he will join the Mavericks on Thursday when the team reaches New York City, as they are scheduled to play the           on Friday. He will continue to rehab from a heel procedure on his own in New York before rejoining the team at a later date. Redick said he made it clear in a conversation with Mavericks owner Mark Cuban that he wasn't upset with Dallas in any way, and said he's excited about playing with ""two transcendent young players"" in           and          . When asked about the Redick trade last week, Griffin, while saying he recognized the strain COVID-19 has placed on families, said the team spent the ""vast majority"" of the year trying to put Redick into a spot near his family. ""We did spend a great deal of time trying to put JJ closer to home,"" Griffin said Friday. ""When it became clear that the teams that were in the best position regionally for him were not necessarily the most aggressive in landing him, we did have conversations about the importance of immediately contending, as he's aging. ""I think we felt confident that JJ welcomed the better contending opportunity because we're not even at the play-in at this point. We felt it was the right thing to do for him and his family."" On Wednesday, shortly after Redick's comments went public, Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy addressed the media, saying a front office's responsibility is to the franchise first. ""[JJ] had some things that he wanted to happen. But I think Griff cared very much about what JJ wanted, but he has a responsibility to Gayle Benson and to the organization that supersedes all of that,"" Van Gundy said. ""Listen, the one thing with me -- and I think I've been consistent about this throughout my career -- is you'll hear people say it from time to time that it's a business; well, it is. Players are going to want to do what's best for them, and they have every damn right to do that, and organizations have every damn right to do what's best for their organization. I have problems when it gets skewed that it's a business from my end, but you should not be a business on your end. That's not right. It's a business on both ends of it. ""Everyone should do what's best for them. That part of it, the business part of basketball, when you're talking about trades and free-agent signings and contracts and all of that -- everyone should do what's best for their interest. Unfortunately, sometimes what the player wants and what the team wants diverge. That's unfortunate, but that's just part of the way it is.""",2

I don't feel we've done the greatest job the last few years and I really hope, and I believe, I've seen a different approach this year,"" Kraft said Wednesday in his annual Q&A with reporters during the NFL owners meeting. The Patriots, who finished 7-9 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2008, have 10 picks in this year's draft (April 29-May 1). Their top selection is 15th overall, which will be their highest pick since tabbing linebacker Jerod Mayo 10th overall in 2008. Their free-agent spending spree, which Kraft explained was strategic in terms of how quickly the team moved with limited competition from other teams due to the declining salary cap, was necessary to fill some holes that would have ideally been filled by draft picks. ""What happened here last year was not something to our liking. We had to make the corrections,"" Kraft said. ""In all the businesses we're involved in, we try to take advantage of inefficiencies in the market. We were in a unique cap situation this year and it allowed us to try to [fix] things we missed, to a certain extent, in the draft. So this was our best opportunity. ""In the end, it all comes out to what happens on the field and how well people execute. You really don't know how good a draft is for at least two years, especially in the environment we're in now ... I'm not quite sure still now what our offseason training and learning abilities will be. I think last year, younger players were really disadvantaged because they didn't have the time to learn."" Kraft said that also applied, in part, to quarterback           after he joined the Patriots in early July without the benefit of an offseason. So while Kraft said that the team still needs to solidify the quarterback position, he's not ruling out Newton being the answer in 2021 and possibly beyond. ""In fairness to Cam, I'm not sure he had the proper weapons around him last year,"" Kraft said, noting Newton's strong start in 2020 before his momentum was stunted after testing positive for COVID-19 in early October. ""I really do believe Cam getting COVID, and what it did to the team, it changed a lot. Now we'll get a chance to see. ""Players on the team, in the locker room, really love the guy. In the end, I trust Coach Belichick's ability to build a team, and put the right players in the best position to succeed."" At the same time, Kraft noted that 2019 fourth-round pick            is still a possibility to emerge, praising his initiative to arrange throwing sessions last week with teammates in Southern California. ""I don't know that Jarrett has ever really gotten a fair shot,"" Kraft said. ""We have to wait and see what happens, and we still have the draft. ... Quarterback is the most important position on the team. One way or the other, we have to get that position solidified."" The Patriots haven't been in this position for decades, as           (2001 to 2020) had taken over for Drew Bledsoe (1993 to 2001) before signing with the           in free agency in March of 2020.

""After 20 years, I'll make this commitment to any player in the future. Anyone who spends 20 years with us, and helps us go to win six Super Bowls, we're not going to keep; look, we could have contract-wise, kept him in our camp. But it's not the right thing,"" he said. This was the first time Kraft answered questions from reporters since the end of the season. Asked how he felt about the 7-9 campaign, he said: ""After my family, the Patriots are the most important thing in my life. The bottom line here is winning.

Biden made his comments as part of an interview with ESPN's Sage Steele that aired on SportsCenter. The Rangers' Globe Life Field, which can seat 40,300 people, is the only Major League Baseball stadium that will allow 100% crowd capacity on its Opening Day. ""Well, that's a decision they made. I think it's a mistake,"" Biden said. ""They should listen to Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, the scientists and the experts. But I think it's not responsible."" Fans attending Rangers games will be required to wear masks except when eating or drinking at their seats. After the April 5 home opener against the          , certain parts of Globe Life Field will have ""distanced seating"" sections that will have more space between occupied seats, according to the Rangers. When asked how he would advise players who might feel hesitant about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, Biden said: ""I would say I'm President of the United States and I got vaccinated. I don't have an unimportant job. Would I take the vaccine if I thought it was going to hurt me? We have done incredible research on the vaccines and they have shown that they work. We have to get to the point where enough people have taken the vaccine so we diminish the possibility for it to spread."" As a way to potentially incentivize MLB players to receive one of three approved vaccines, Major League Baseball           that outlined relaxed protocols for vaccinated players, coaches and staff members, allowing them the freedom to eat at restaurants, gather indoors and fully utilize clubhouse amenities, among other activities. The league has specified two sets of relaxed protocols: one for individuals two weeks removed from being fully vaccinated; and the other for teams that get 85% of their Tier 1 employees fully vaccinated. People throughout the industry have previously expressed concern that enough players would agree to vaccinations for relaxed protocols to kick in. But           manager Mike Shildt said Wednesday that his team had already reached that mark, and           third baseman           expressed confidence that his team would eventually do the same. Other clubs are expected to follow. The          , however, announced they received a positive COVID-19 test from an undisclosed player and that four other players would miss Thursday's opener against the visiting            under the contact-tracing protocol. The Nationals will open their stadium to 5,000 fans on Thursday, a 12% capacity that is tied with the           for the lowest in the sport. Several teams hope to join the Rangers on the 100% milestone over the summer. The NFL, meanwhile, is already making plans to host fans at full capacity when its season opens on Sept. 9,          . Biden noted that more than 600 million doses of the three vaccines -- Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna -- have been purchased by the U.S. government and that 75% of people age 65 and older have received at least one of them. ""We are moving across the board that way,"" Biden said. ""That's going to diminish the prospects of its spread. In terms of it being responsible [for stadiums to open at full capacity] -- you see what's happening in Europe now when they lifted the mandates. I don't know why we don't just follow the science and beat this -- just flat out beat it. We are going to have enough vaccinations, vaccinators. We've opened places. We're doing everything we can to make it clear to people, 'Get the vaccine as quickly as you can get it.' By the end of [April], we're going to be in a position where everyone can get the vaccine."" As MLB and the MLB Players Association grapple with player vaccinations and how they affect the ever-evolving health and safety protocols, the league and the union are also monitoring a potential controversy around July's All-Star Game in Atlanta. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed into law last week a sweeping, Republican-sponsored bill that includes new restrictions on voting by mail and greater legislative control over how elections are run, one that, critics say, will disproportionately disenfranchise voters of color. MLBPA executive director Tony Clark previously said he ""would look forward"" to discussions around moving the Midsummer Classic out of Truist Park, and Biden, a Democrat, said he would ""strongly support"" such a decision. ""People look to them,"" Biden said, referring to professional athletes and their outsize platforms. ""They're leaders. Look at what happened with the NBA, as well. Look what's happened across the board. The very people who were victimized the most are the people who are the leaders in these various sports, and it's just not right. This is Jim Crow on steroids what they're doing in Georgia and 40 other states. What's it all about? Imagine passing a law saying you cannot provide water or food for someone standing in line to vote. Can't do that? Come on. Or you're going to close the polling place at 5 o'clock when people just get off? This is all about keeping working folks that I grew up with from being able to vote."" Biden described his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, as a die-hard fan of Philadelphia sports teams and said the best athletes in his family are women, noting that one of his granddaughters is all-state in two sports. Biden and his wife hosted Olympic gold medalist Megan Rapinoe and her U.S. women's soccer teammate Margaret Purce in the Oval Office last Wednesday, then watched Rapinoe speak at an ""Equal Pay Day"" event in which she said she has been ""devalued"" as a woman. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that in 2019, women earned 82 cents for each dollar paid to a man. ""I just don't think it's right and don't think it's fair,"" Biden told Steele.

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/kyle-pitts-puts-show-florida-gators-pro-day/story?id=76802088,sports,"GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- There was no shortage of           highlights at the           pro day Wednesday, from his measurables to his moves to even his mindset. Pitts put on a show, even before he stepped on the field to catch passes from quarterback           for maybe the last time. His 83⅜-inch wingspan was more than impressive, even by NFL standards. The 6-foot-6 and 245-pound Philadelphia native also had a 33½-inch vertical, recorded 10 feet, 9 inches in the broad jump and managed 22 repetitions of 225 pounds on the bench press. Pitts later covered the 40-yard dash in 4.45 seconds, not far off tight end Vernon Davis' combine watershed mark (4.38) set in 2006. He ended the day running routes for Trask and then raised some eyebrows while sharing his No. 1 goal. ""Start at a high level and keep increasing every year and being able to do other things that other tight ends aren't doing, which would make me special,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, with all the preparation and through the years, I feel like I'll be the best to ever do it."" Pitts, Trask and several teammates -- most notably cornerback           and receivers           and           -- worked out for talent evaluators from 31 of 32 NFL teams. Four head coaches were in attendance: Urban Meyer (          ), Matt Rhule (          ), Brian Flores (          ) and Zac Taylor (          ). Pitts is widely considered a lock to be a top-10 pick in the draft, and it's possible for Pitts to be the highest-drafted tight end in the modern era (since 1970). Denver drafted Riley Odoms fifth overall in 1972. Davis and Kellen Winslow Jr. (2004) both went sixth. ""He's a different bird than what a traditional tight end has been or certainly has been when I played,"" said           coach Dan Campbell, a tight end who played 11 NFL seasons. ""Look, he's one of those guys that's talented, but there's a number of guys up there that are talented. ... There's a number of guys that you'd be fired up to have one way or another."" The Lions have the tight end most recently drafted in the top 10,           in 2018. Hockenson is among a growing list of recent first-rounders at the position --          ,          ,          ,          ,           and           are others -- whose careers, at least at times, have fallen short of expectations. Pitts caught 43 passes for 770 yards and 12 touchdowns in 7½ games last season. He missed 10 quarters following a vicious hit against Georgia in early November that knocked his helmet so sideways that his face mask fractured his septum. He had surgery and sat out two full games. He returned, scored three times against Kentucky and then opted out of the Cotton Bowl after another unstoppable performance against Alabama in the Southeastern Conference championship game.",2

On Monday, the visiting Flyers overcame a 3-0 deficit to beat Buffalo in the shootout.

During his pregame media availability, Utah coach Quin Snyder declined to answer a question about whether Tuesday's frightening incident could impact Mitchell's availability for future road games. The Jazz, who have a home back-to-back this weekend, are next scheduled to play on the road Monday in Dallas. Snyder said the Jazz met Wednesday morning in Memphis to help one another process the terrifying experience. ""I don't know that an experience like that is just suddenly passed on and away,"" Snyder said. ""Everybody's impacted in different ways, all very significant. And it wasn't something that we were going to solve by just talking through everything, but I think it was important to acknowledge what we all went through [Tuesday], and, really, that same feeling of gratitude and appreciation for the fragility that we all live with, sometimes without being aware of it."" Conley said it felt like there was an explosion on the plane, a Delta charter. He said the plane immediately started to bounce and tilt left, and people in the back saw flames as altitude dropped on the flight. ""Nobody knows. Everybody's just quiet,"" said Conley, who had 26 points and seven assists in the win over the Grizzlies. ""It took the pilots probably five to 10 minutes, probably about 10 minutes, to go through everything, go through their checks and get back to us and let us know what was going on.

We're thankful it wasn't as serious as it could have been, but it was scary."" Snyder, Clarkson and Conley each praised the pilots for their calm, professionalism and expertise in executing the emergency landing. ""It's definitely something, an experience, that we're happy to be able to tell,"" Clarkson said. ""A lot of us really came to a point ... at least 30 seconds in that flight, everybody came to the point where it was like, 'Man, it might be over for us.' It's sad to say that.

""They absolutely got the job done under heavy pressure. They pulled together, instead of apart.""  made 31 saves in goal for Buffalo. The Sabres had gone 0-15-3 since Feb. 25. They own the record for the longest winless streak of the shootout era (since 2005-06) and tied the 2003-04           for the most consecutive losses -- including overtime and shootout defeats -- in the 21st century. The Sabres were the 18th team in NHL history to go winless over an 18-game span. ""I don't get too high or low on wins. You have to enjoy it for a few minutes and move on to the next one,"" Granato said, ""but I was extremely happy for our guys."" Buffalo is 7-23-5 (.271 points percentage) on the season, last in the NHL.",2

Literally. The newly acquired Lakers center exited Wednesday's           to the           with a bruised right big toe in the third quarter and did not return. X-rays on Drummond's toe came back negative, according to the team. Vogel said Drummond would be reevaluated Thursday and his status is day to day. The Lakers play next on Friday on the road against the           . ""I didn't really think anything of it,"" Drummond said. ""I came back in the second quarter and it was hurting a little bit more. And then after halftime, I finally took my sock off to look and my whole toenail was gone. So, it was just all bad from there. I couldn't walk or run. So I just told Coach [Frank Vogel] to take me out."" It was Drummond's first game action since Feb. 12, after which his former team, the          , pulled him from the rotation while searching for a trade partner to take on the nine-year veteran's $29.5 million salary. Drummond was waived last week when the Cavs couldn't find a deal to their liking, and he signed with the Lakers on Sunday. Despite the lengthy layoff, Drummond said, ""right now, I'm probably in the best shape I can be in"" earlier this week when looking ahead to suiting up for the Lakers for the first time. Drummond started the game in a pair of Air Jordan XI IE sneakers and swapped them out for a pair of LeBron 16 Lows. He received treatment at halftime, delaying his readiness for the third quarter, leaving Vogel no choice but to start           at center for the second half. Drummond subbed in for Harrell with 9 minutes, 29 seconds remaining in the third quarter, and then checked out of the game for good with 7:55 on the clock, limping to the bench. Before heading to the locker room, Drummond removed one of his sneakers, revealing a wrap around the big toe and second toe on his right foot. ""What do you do for a toe? I don't know,"" said Drummond, who wore sandals during his postgame interview. ""I'm not really sure what to do. I'm just going to talk to the training staff and find out what's the best thing to do to get back as quick as possible."" Lakers forward           said he has lost a toenail before and that it was an ordeal to overcome. ""I mean I played the next game, but s---, man, that s--- was like a month and a half before it started feeling better,"" Morris said. ""Because you don't realize how much your toe is rubbing against the top of your shoes, or you're using your toe for power. ... It's a terrible thing."" Said Drummond: ""I've lost a toenail before. But this one was very painful."" Drummond finished with four points on 2-for-6 shooting (0-for-2 on free throws), one rebound, two assists, one block, three turnovers and four fouls in 14 minutes. It was not the debut he and the Lakers were hoping for, however, there was a flash of success in his initial shift as a Laker. L.A. outscored Milwaukee by seven points in the seven minutes Drummond played in the first quarter. ""In that first quarter, a lot of energy from our guys and myself,"" he said. ""We were having a lot of fun out there. Just unfortunate for that to happen in the first game."" , displaced from the starting lineup by Drummond, started the fourth quarter at center and contributed two points, three rebounds, two blocks, one assist and one steal in six minutes. While Gasol declined to speak to reporters afterward -- the third time he has declined since L.A. acquired Drummond -- several members of the team praised him for his professionalism. ""Obviously, it's not easy by any means. Give that man his credit,"" Lakers guard           said. ""We love what we do and we compete and we're ultra competitors, and that's never easy for anybody in that position.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/virgin-galactic-rolls-latest-generation-spaceship-76768132,business,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Virgin Galactic rolled out its newest spaceship Tuesday as the company looks to resume test flights in the coming months at its headquarters in the New Mexico desert. Company officials said it will likely be summer before the ship — designed and manufactured in California — undergoes glide flight testing at Spaceport America in southern New Mexico. That will coincide with the final round of testing for the current generation of spacecraft, which will be the one that takes British billionaire and Virgin Galactic founder Sir Richard Branson to the fringes of space later this year. CEO Michael Colglazier said the addition of the new ship marks the beginning of Virgin Galactic having a fleet that will one day be capable of ferrying paying customers and scientific payloads from spaceports around the globe. The company is still aiming for commercial operations to begin next year following testing and a few months of downtime for maintenance and other upgrades. Virgin Galactic has reached space twice before — the first time from California in December 2018. The company marked its second successful glide flight over Spaceport America last June. Virgin Galactic is one of a few companies looking to cash in on customers with an interest in space. Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin launched a new capsule in January as part of test as it aims to get its program for tourists, scientists and professional astronauts off the ground. The mirror-like finish on Virgin Galactic's new ship is as much about aesthetics as it is about function. A key part of the ship's thermal protection system, Colglazier said it also was chosen so the craft could take on the look and feel of its surroundings — whether it's on Earth, in the sky or in space. The other task of the engineers was to create a new version that would be easier to manufacture and to maintain. “Obviously for us to take tens of thousands of people to space, we need a number of ships. But it really matters then how often can each of these ships fly,” Colglazier said. “We expect as we get going on this to see a much quicker turnaround time and that really will help us grow the business.” First, Virgin Galactic needs regulatory approval for the current generation and that means successful rocket-powered test flights. The first powered test from Spaceport America was scheduled for December but computer trouble caused by electromagnetic interference prevented the spaceship’s rocket from firing properly. Instead of soaring toward space, the ship and its two pilots were forced to make an immediate landing. The test was rescheduled for February but then scrapped as the team continued working on the interference issue. Colglazier said the flight now is scheduled for May. The delay didn't help stock prices. Colglazier said while it's important to put points on the board and meet market expectations, the company's focus is on safety at each step and the decades ahead. “I think this is moving as we want it to move. It is stepwise — that is what we want to do with human spaceflight,"" he said, “but you can also see the monument building. We’re excited for this unveiling today and we’re excited for May and we’re excited for the summer to come.”",0

https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/detectives-find-tiger-woods-crash-reveal-citing-privacy/story?id=76805560,sports,"LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles County sheriff says detectives have determined what caused           to crash his SUV last month in Southern California but would not release details Wednesday, citing unspecified privacy concerns for the golf star. Sheriff Alex Villanueva told the Associated Press during a live social media event that ""a cause has been determined; the investigation has concluded,"" but claimed that investigators needed permission from Woods -- who previously named his yacht ""Privacy"" -- to release information about the crash. Later Wednesday evening the sheriff's department attempted to clarify its position, saying in a statement on Twitter that ""the release of accident reports is governed under California Vehicle Code Section 20012. When we are able, we intend to release the information learned during the traffic collision investigation involving Tiger Woods."" Woods suffered serious injuries in the Feb. 23 crash when he struck a raised median around 7 a.m. in Rolling Hills Estates, just outside Los Angeles. The Genesis SUV he was driving crossed through two oncoming lanes and uprooted a tree on a downhill stretch that police said is known for wrecks. Woods is in Florida recovering from multiple surgeries. Villanueva has been criticized for his comments about the crash, calling it ""purely an accident"" and saying there was no evidence of impairment. Woods told deputies he did not know how the crash occurred and didn't remember driving. He was unconscious when a witness first approached the mangled SUV. But a sheriff's deputy said the athlete later appeared to be in shock but was conscious and able to answer basic questions. That initial statement from the sheriff's deputy has been cited as a reason investigators did not seek a search warrant for Woods' blood samples, which could have been screened for drugs and alcohol. In 2017, Woods checked himself into a clinic for help in dealing with prescription medication after a DUI charge in Florida. Detectives, however, did obtain a search warrant for the data recorder, known as a black box, from the 2021 Genesis GV80 SUV. Villanueva would not say Wednesday what data had been found in the black box. ""We have reached out to Tiger Woods and his personnel,"" Villanueva said. ""There's some privacy issues on releasing information on the investigation, so we're going to ask them if they waive the privacy and then we will be able to do a full release on all the information regarding the accident."" California has rather restrictive public records laws when it comes to law enforcement agencies. By law, it can withhold copies of accident reports, although generally it releases basic information. The law the sheriff's department cited Wednesday holds that ""all required accident reports, and supplemental reports ... shall be for the confidential use of the Department of Motor Vehicles and the Department of the California Highway Patrol."" However, it also states that ""the Department of the California Highway Patrol or the law enforcement agency to whom the accident was reported shall disclose the entire contents of the reports, the names and addresses of persons involved or injured in, or witnesses to, an accident, the registration numbers and descriptions of vehicles involved, the date, time and location of an accident, all diagrams, statements of the drivers involved or occupants injured in the accident and the statements of all witnesses to any person who may have a proper interest"" in the accident. Because Woods was the only person injured in the accident, and Villanueva has previously stated he was not being charged with a crime, only parties whose property was damaged in the accident -- such as the owners of the car, the city or neighbors -- would be entitled to a copy of the full accident report. Woods' agent at Excel Sports, Mark Steinberg, did not immediately respond to an email. ""We have all the contents of the black box, we've got everything,"" Villanueva said. ""It's completed, signed, sealed and delivered. However, we can't release it without the permission of the people involved in the collision."" Greg Risling, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County district attorney, said in an email Wednesday that no felony or misdemeanor complaints against Woods had been filed through their office regarding the crash. Villanueva's statement about privacy issues did not make sense to Joseph Giacalone, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a retired New York City Police Department sergeant, who has criticized the sheriff's response to the Woods incident from the start. ""I don't think I've ever seen a department ever ask for permission like that,"" he said. ""What happens if his lawyers say 'no, you can't send it out now.' And then where does that leave us?"" Giacalone said it's unlikely that deputies would have sought the permission of non-celebrity victims in similar crashes to release information. If the sheriff's hesitancy stemmed from a potential medical episode behind the wheel, Giacalone said, authorities could simply say it was a medical emergency without giving additional details. ""I don't think they would have asked any family member of us if they can come out with it,"" he said. Woods is from the Los Angeles area and was back home to host his PGA tournament, the Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club, which ended two days before the crash. He was driving an SUV lent to him by the tournament. Woods, 45, has never gone an entire year without playing, dating back to his first PGA Tour event as a 16-year-old in high school.          ",0

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/student-loan-relief-extended-privately-held-loans-76776264,business,"The federal government’s pause on student loan payments is being extended to more than 1 million borrowers who have defaulted on student loans that are held by private lenders, the Education Department announced Tuesday. The action is meant to bring relief to the hardest-hit borrowers in a program that allowed private lenders to provide student loans that were backed by the federal government. The program ended in 2010 when the Education Department became the sole lender of federally subsidized student loans. President Joe Biden announced in January that federal student loan payments would remain suspended and interest rates would be set at 0% through at least Sept. 30, extending an action from the administration of former President  . But it applied only to those with debt held directly by the federal government, leaving out millions with private student loans. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona on Monday extended the payment pause and 0% interest rate to 1.1 million borrowers who had defaulted on privately held loans. It includes more than 800,000 who were at risk of having their tax refunds seized to repay a defaulted loan. “Our goal is to enable these borrowers who are struggling in default to get the same protections previously made available to tens of millions of other borrowers to help weather the uncertainty of the pandemic,” Cardona said in a statement. The Education Department said it’s working to return tax refunds or wages that were seized over the last year to cover the defaulted loans. Borrowers can also request refunds for any voluntary payments they made during the past year. Any loans that went into default since March 13, 2020, will be returned to good standing. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., chair of the House’s education committee, called it “a necessary step to putting money in the pockets of struggling Americans and their families.” Advocacy groups called the measure a good start but said it fails to help more than 5 million borrowers other borrowers in the same program, known as the Federal Family Education Loan Program. “This is not enough,” said Persis Yu, director of the National Consumer Law Center’s Student Loan Borrower Assistance project. “The millions of FFEL borrowers who have not yet defaulted but who may be struggling to make their student loan payments often at the expense of other vital necessities need relief.”",0

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/lighting-fuse-amazon-vote-spark-union-pushes-76768728,business,"What happens inside a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, could have major implications not just for the country's second-largest employer but the labor movement at large. Organizers are pushing for some 6,000   workers there to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union on the promise it will lead to better working conditions, better pay and more respect.   is pushing back, arguing that it already offers more than twice the minimum wage in Alabama and workers get such benefits as  , vision and dental insurance without paying union dues. The two sides are fully aware that it's not just the Bessemer warehouse on the line. Organizers hope what happens there will inspire thousands of workers nationwide — and not just at Amazon — to consider unionizing and revive a labor movement that has been waning for decades. “This is lighting a fuse, which I believe is going to spark an explosion of union organizing across the country, regardless of the results,” says RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum. The union push could spread to other parts of Amazon and threaten the company's profits, which soared 84% last year to $21 billion. At a time when many companies were cutting jobs, Amazon was one of the few still hiring, bringing on board 500,000 people last year alone to keep up with a surge of online orders. Bessemer workers finished casting their votes on Monday. The counting begins on Tuesday, which could take days or longer depending on how many votes are received and how much time it takes for each side to review. The process is being overseen by the National Labor Relations Board and a majority of the votes will decide the final outcome. What that outcome will be is anyone's guess. Appelbaum thinks workers who voted early likely rejected the union because Amazon’s messaging got to them first. He says momentum changed in March as organizers talked to more workers and heard from basketball players and high-profile elected officials, including         President Joe Biden. For Amazon, which employs more than 950,000 full- and part-time workers in the U.S. and nearly 1.3 million worldwide, a union could lead to higher wages that would eat into its profits. Higher wages would also mean higher costs to get packages to shoppers’ doorsteps, which may prompt Amazon to raise prices, says Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. In a statement, Amazon says it encouraged all its employees to vote and that “their voices will be heard in the days ahead.” Any push to unionize is considered a long shot, since labor laws tend to favor employers. Alabama itself is a “right-to-work” state, which allows workers in unionized shops to opt out of paying union dues even as they retain the benefits and job protection negotiated by the union. Kent Wong, the director of the UCLA Labor Center, says companies in the past have closed stores, warehouses or plants after workers have voted to unionize. “There’s a history of companies going to great lengths to avoid recognizing the union,” he says. Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer and biggest private employer, has successfully fought off organizing efforts over the years. In 2000, it got rid of butchers in 180 of its stores after they voted to form a union. Walmart said it cut the jobs because people preferred pre-packaged meat. Five years later, it closed a store in Canada where some 200 workers were close to winning a union contract. At the time, Walmart said demands from union negotiators made it impossible for the store to sustain itself. The only other time Amazon came up against a union vote was in 2014, when the majority of the 30 workers at a Delaware warehouse turned it down. This time around, Amazon has been hanging anti-union signs throughout the Bessemer warehouse, including inside bathroom stalls, and holding mandatory meetings to convince workers why the union is a bad idea, according to one worker who recently         testified at a Senate hearing. It has also created a website for employees that tells them they’ll have to pay $500 in union dues a month, taking away money that could go to dinners and school supplies. Amazon's hardball tactics extend beyond squashing union efforts. Last year, it         fired a worker who organized a walkout at a New York warehouse to demand greater protection against coronavirus, saying the employee himself flouted distancing rules. When Seattle, the home of its headquarters, passed a new tax on big companies in 2018, Amazon protested by         stopping construction of a new high-rise building in the city; the tax was repealed four weeks later. And in 2019, Amazon         ditched plans to build a $2.5 billion headquarters for 25,000 workers in New York after pushback from progressive politicians and unions. Beyond Amazon is an         anti-union culture that dominates the South. And unions have lost ground nationally for decades since their peak in the decades following World War II. In 1970, almost a third of the U.S. workforce belonged to a union. In 2020, that figure was 10.8%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Private sector workers now account for less than half of the 14.3 million union members across the country. Advocates say a victory would signal a shift in the narrative about unions, helping refute the typical arguments from companies, including Amazon, that workers can win adequate compensation and conditions by dealing with management directly. “It is because of unions that we have a five-day work week. It is because of unions that we have safer conditions in our places of work. It is because of unions that we have benefits,” says Rep. Terri Sewell, whose congressional district includes the Amazon facility. “Workers should have the right to choose whether they organize or not.” Union leaders are circumspect about specific organizing plans after the Bessemer vote, and Appelbaum says he doesn't want to tip off Amazon to any future efforts. But there is broad consensus that a win would spur workers at some of the 230 other Amazon warehouses to mount a similar union campaign. It’s less clear whether any ripple effects would reach other prime targets like Walmart and the expansive auto industry that has burgeoned across the South in recent decades. Both have largely succeeded at keeping unions at bay. The auto workers union has had some of the largest union pushes of the last decade, but their most intense and publicized efforts ended in failure. In 2017, a years-long campaign to unionize a Nissan plant in Canton, Mississippi, ended with a decisive 2,244-1,307 rejection of the union — the kind of margin that would be devastating in Bessemer. Two years later, however, Volkswagen workers in Tennessee had a much more evenly split vote, with 776 workers supporting unionization and 833 voting against it. Besides the number of Amazon workers involved, the Alabama campaign has stood out because of how explicitly many advocates have linked the effort to the civil rights movement of the 20th century. The RWDSU estimates that more than 80% of the warehouse workers in Bessemer are Black. Robert Korstad, a Duke Emeritus professor and labor history expert, says those dynamics could help in Bessemer. “The history of the Black struggle in Alabama is pretty deeply entrenched in the social, political and religious institutions there,” he says. “We’re starting to see people rise up again. So this Amazon struggle is part of a larger struggle that’s gone on a long time.” The question, Korstad says, is whether a win in Bessemer truly becomes a “ripple effect” that inspires workers across racial and ethnic lines elsewhere.",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/newsmax-post-election-samplers-76778228,business,"NEW YORK -- The trajectory of the conservative network Newsmax is a clear example of how statistics can tell different stories, depending on how you look at them. After former President Trump suggested post-Election Day that his fans check Newsmax out, the network's daily viewership average shot up to nearly 275,000 last November, the Nielsen company said. In the period between President Biden's inauguration and mid-March, Newsmax averaged 207,400 viewers — a 24% decrease. Pull back a little further, however, and consider Newsmax's average of 57,800 viewers last October. Compared to that month, the post-inauguration viewership is up 259%. It's up 533% over last September. In other words, a majority — although not all — of the curious viewers from last November have stuck around. “I think we're in a very, very strong position,” said Chris Ruddy, Newsmax founder and CEO. “We've consolidated a lot of our success over the last 90 days.” Newsmax can see a difference in the prominence of its guests, he said. The network is looking to expand and will soon add six hours of live programming on Sunday. It has signed Steve Cortes, a former CNN contributor and adviser to the Trump campaign, to host a future show and conservative personality Sebastian Gorka will host a weekend show, Ruddy said. Since the fevered post-election days, viewership is down at all of the news networks.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asian-shares-rise-amid-mixed-market-signs-76763801,business,"TOKYO -- Asian shares were mixed Wednesday as pointed to a strong economic recovery in China but worries lingered about the   pandemic. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 dipped 0.8% in morning trading to 29,200.21. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 1.5% to 6,841.60. South Korea's Kospi was little changed, gaining less than 0.1% to 3,071.42. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.6% to 28,407.21, while the Shanghai Composite shed 0.9% to 3,424.44. A survey released Wednesday shows China’s factory activity rebounded in March from a three-month slowdown as export orders rose. The monthly index of manufacturing issued by the China’s statistics agency and an industry group rose to 51.9 from February’s 50.6 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity expanding. Chinese manufacturing has rebounded to above pre-pandemic levels in most industries but consumer and export demand have been slower to recover. Restrictions on trade in technology have also hurt exports, economists said. “Let’s reiterate that the technology war is the No. 1 risk faced by China in 2021. Chinese companies continue to face difficulties in buying and selling technology parts, products and services from companies on the U.S. entity list, which can include non-U.S. companies,” said Iris Pang, chief economist at IG. “Another risk, which is hopefully temporary, is the fragile recovery of export demand that comes from restrictive social distancing measures, and even lockdowns, in the U.S. and Europe,” Pang said in a commentary. U.S. stock indexes fell as another swell higher for Treasury yields pressured big technology stocks. Yields perked higher after a report showed consumers are even more confident than economists expected. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 1.74%. Its jump this year has forced investors to reconsider paying such high prices for many stocks, particularly the tech giants that were big winners earlier in the pandemic. Health care stocks also dragged shares lower, outweighing gains by banks, industrial stocks and companies that rely on consumer spending. The S&P 500 slid 0.3% to 3,958.55, its second decline in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.3% from the all-time high it set a day before, to 33,066.96. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.1% to 13,045.39. The Russell 2000 rose 1.7%, to 2,195.80. Investors are awaiting details of President Joe Biden's proposals for spending perhaps even more than $3 trillion on infrastructure and other measures to help the economy and environment. Despite the pressure on big tech stocks, most professional investors remain optimistic that the broader market can keep rising. A stronger economy thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations and massive spending by the U.S. government should help boost profits for many companies this year, particularly those like banks, energy producers and industrial companies. Much of the market’s choppiness is reflecting that expectation. Investors have been shifting money away from companies like Amazon and Netflix, which benefited from a world on lockdown, to airlines, automakers and others that are poised to benefit from a broader reopening. “Big picture-wise, we’re moving in the direction of a rebalance trade,” said Greg Bassuk, chairman and CEO of AXS Investments. “In the next immediate period we’re going to continue to see significant volatility.” In energy trading, U.S. benchmark crude inched down 1 cent to $60.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 6 cents to $64.20 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 110.70 Japanese yen from 110.25 yen.

The federal government began distributing the third round of economic impact payments in mid-March to millions of Americans. But a paperwork delay temporarily held up payments to Social Security, Supplemental Security Income and Railroad Retirement Board beneficiaries who did not file a 2019 or 2020 tax return or did not use the tool made available on IRS website for non-filers. The IRS said Tuesday that it expects payments will be sent to those beneficiaries on April 7. The government needed updated beneficiary information to begin distributing the latest round of payments. After receiving data from the Social Security Administration on Thursday, the IRS began reviewing, validating, and testing tens of millions of records to ensure eligibility and proper calculation of the payments. If no additional issues arise, the IRS said it expects to complete that work and to begin processing these payments at the end of this week. Because the majority of the payments will be disbursed electronically, they would be received on April 7. The IRS updates its Get My Payment tool for eligible individuals once their payment is processed. The agency notes that the tool on IRS.gov will not be updated until this coming weekend with information for federal beneficiaries expecting payments next week. The IRS said it is still reviewing data received for Veterans Affairs benefit recipients and expects to determine a payment date and provide more details soon.",0
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/volkswagen-issued-false-news-release-joke-76777376,business,"DETROIT -- Volkswagen of America issued false statements this week saying it would change its brand name to “Voltswagen,” to stress its commitment to electric vehicles, only to reverse course Tuesday and admit that the supposed name change was a joke. Mark Gillies, a company spokesman, confirmed Tuesday that the statement had been a pre-April Fool's Day joke after having insisted Monday that the release was legitimate and the name change accurate. The company's false statement was distributed again Tuesday, saying the brand-name change reflected a shift to more battery-electric vehicles. Volkswagen's intentionally fake news release, highly unusual for a major public company, coincides with its efforts to repair its image as it tries to recover from a         2015 scandal in which it cheated on government emissions tests and allowed diesel-powered vehicles to illegally pollute the air. In that scandal,   admitted that about 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide were fitted with the deceptive software. The software reduced nitrogen oxide emissions when the cars were placed on a test machine but allowed higher emissions and improved engine performance during normal driving. The scandal cost   $35 billion (30 billion euros) in fines and civil settlements and led to the recall of millions of vehicles. The company's fake news release, leaked on Monday and then repeated in a mass e-mail to reporters Tuesday, resulted in articles about the name change in multiple media outlets, including The Associated Press. In falsely announcing a name change, the company went beyond telling reporters that its news release was legitimate. On Tuesday, the company emailed to reporters a press release that quoted its CEO announcing the fake change: “We might be changing out our K for a T, but what we aren’t changing is this brand’s commitment to making best-in-class vehicles for drivers and people everywhere,” Scott Keogh, president and CEO of Volkswagen of America, said in the release. The fake release could land Volkswagen in trouble with U.S. securities regulators because its stock price rose nearly 5% on Tuesday, the day the bogus statement was officially issued. Investors of late have been responding positively to news of companies increasing electric vehicle production, swelling the value of shares of Tesla as well as of some EV startups. James Cox, who teaches corporate and securities law at Duke University, said the Securities and Exchange Commission should take action to deal with such misinformation, which can distort stock prices. “The whole market has gone crazy,” Cox said. “We need to throw a pretty clear line in the sand, I believe, about what is permissible and what isn’t permissible.” This week's Volkswagen incident bears some similarity to one in 2018 in which Tesla's CEO   tweeted that he had the funding secured to take the company private — a comment that drove up the stock price, Cox noted. Later, it was revealed that the funding had not been lined up.         Musk and Tesla each agreed to pay $20 million in penalties to the SEC. Erik Gordon, a business and law professor at the University of Michigan, said he thought that for the SEC to be interested, it would have to believe that VW knowingly issued the fake news release to manipulate its stock price. “I don’t think the SEC is going to see this as stock price manipulation any more than when General Motors or Ford or Toyota or anybody talks about their (electric vehicle) future,” Gordon said. “It is incredibly stupid, but if being stupid were illegal, a third of the CEOs in the U.S. would be in jail.” A message was left Tuesday seeking a comment from the SEC. Late Tuesday, VW issued a statement confirming that it won't be changing its brand name to ""Voltswagen."" “The renaming was designed to be an announcement in the spirit of April Fool's Day,” the company said. Tim Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University, said April Fool’s jokes are common in marketing. But he said it's rare for a company to deliberately mislead reporters. “The problem is that in the short run, you can fool people, and it seems cute and entertaining,"" Calkins said. ""But in the long run, you really do need positive and good relations with the media. For a company that already has credibility problems, this is really a strange move.” Calkins said that while the incident might not hurt VW with consumers, the company needs good relations with reporters to build its brand image over time.",4

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-protects-younger-teens-76785747,business,"Pfizer announced Wednesday that its COVID-19 vaccine is safe and strongly protective in kids as young as 12, a step toward possibly beginning shots in this age group before they head back to school in the fall. Most COVID-19   being rolled out worldwide are for adults, who are at higher risk from the  . Pfizer’s vaccine is authorized for ages 16 and older. But vaccinating children of all ages will be critical to stopping the pandemic — and helping schools, at least the upper grades, start to look a little more normal after months of disruption. In a study of 2,260 U.S. volunteers ages 12 to 15, preliminary data showed there were no cases of COVID-19 among fully vaccinated adolescents compared to 18 among those given dummy shots, Pfizer reported. It's a small study, that hasn't yet been published, so another important piece of evidence is how well the shots revved up the kids’ immune systems. Researchers reported high levels of virus-fighting antibodies, somewhat higher than were seen in studies of young adults. Kids had side effects similar to young adults, the company said. The main side effects are pain, fever, chills and fatigue, particularly after the second dose. The study will continue to track participants for two years for more information about long-term protection and safety. Dr. Philip J. Landrigan of Boston College said the results are encouraging. “It’s hard to get kids to comply with masking and distancing, so something that gives them hard protection and takes them out of the mix of spreading the virus is all for the good,” said Landrigan , who was not involved in the study. Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech in the coming weeks plan to ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulators to allow emergency use of the shots starting at age 12. “We share the urgency to expand the use of our vaccine,” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement. He expressed “the hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year"" in the United States. Pfizer isn’t the only company seeking to lower the age limit for its vaccine. Results also are expected by the middle of this year from a U.S. study of Moderna’s vaccine in 12- to 17-year-olds. But in a sign that the findings were promising, the FDA already allowed both companies to         begin U.S. studies  in children 11 and younger, working their way to as young as 6-month-old. “We are longing for a normal life. This is especially true for our children,” BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said in a statement. AstraZeneca last month began a study of its vaccine among 6- to 17-year-olds in Britain. Johnson & Johnson is planning its own pediatric studies. And in China, Sinovac recently announced it has submitted preliminary data to Chinese regulators showing its vaccine is safe in children as young as 3. While most COVID-19   being used globally were first tested in tens of thousands of adults, pediatric studies won’t need to be nearly as large. Scientists have safety information from those studies and from subsequent vaccinations in millions more adults. One key question is the dosage: Pfizer gave the 12-and-older participants the same dose adults receive, while testing different doses in younger children. It's not clear how quickly the FDA would act on Pfizer's request to allow vaccination starting at age 12. The agency has taken about three weeks to review and authorize each of the vaccines currently available for adults. That process included holding a public meeting of outside experts to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of each shot. The process for reviewing data in children could be shorter, given FDA’s familiarity with each vaccine. An agency spokeswoman said the FDA had no information to share on how the review would work, including whether additional public meetings would be required. Another question is when the country would have enough supply of shots — and people to get them into adolescents' arms — to let kids start getting in line. Supplies are set to steadily increase over the spring and summer, at the same time states are opening vaccinations to younger, healthier adults who until now haven't had a turn. Children represent about 13% of COVID-19 cases documented in the U.S. And while children are far less likely than adults to get seriously ill, at least 268 have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. alone and more than 13,500 have been hospitalized, according to a tally by the American Academy of Pediatrics. That’s more than die from the flu in an average year. Additionally, a small number have developed a serious inflammatory condition linked to the coronavirus. Caleb Chung, who turns 13 later this week, agreed to volunteer after his father, a Duke University pediatrician, presented the option. He doesn't know if he received the vaccine or a placebo. “Usually I’m just at home doing online school and there’s not much I can really do to fight back against the virus,” Caleb said in a recent interview. The study “was really somewhere that I could actually help out.” His father, Dr. Richard Chung, said he’s proud of his son and all the other children volunteering for the needle pricks, blood tests and other tasks a study entails. “We need kids to do these trials so that kids can get protected. Adults can’t do that for them,” Chung said. ——— AP video journalist Federica Narancio contributed to this report. ——— The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/amid-astrazeneca-setback-germany-banks-homegrown-vaccine-76789321,business,"MARBURG, Germany -- As   ponders how to accelerate its sluggish   vaccination campaign after         yet another hitch involving the AstraZeneca shot, a production facility in the historic pharmaceutical center of Marburg may hold part of the answer to reliable supply in the months and years ahead. BioNTech, the German company that developed the first widely used vaccine together with U.S. partner Pfizer, is busily starting up a production facility that it says can produce up to a billion doses this year alone. That estimate was raised from the original hopes for 700 million. The company, which had never brought a pharmaceutical product to market before, wowed the world last year when it got authorization to sell a completely new type of vaccine in Britain, the United States and Europe — three highly regulated markets for medical products. The active ingredient in the shot is messenger RNA, or mRNA, which contains the instructions for human cells to construct a harmless piece of the coronavirus called the spike protein. The human immune system recognizes the spike protein as foreign, allowing it to mount a response against the virus upon infection. Scientists have known how to make mRNA for some time, but not for commercial mass production. “This is what makes it exciting from a scientific perspective, but also from a manufacturing perspective, to do it on such a large scale, in such a short period of time,” said Valeska Skilling, head of production at the plant. BioNTech only received approval Friday from the European Medicines Agency for the manufacture of the vaccine at the Marburg site, which was bought from Novartis last year. The site is located within a pharma industry cluster whose roots go back more than a century to Nobel Prize winner Emil von Behring, who developed the antitoxin for diptheria and tetanus. Globally, BioNTech and Pfizer now estimate they can manufacture 2.5 billion doses in 2021, half a billion more than forecast in February. To make that happen, some 400 employees are confronting the challenges of large-scale production involving around 50,000 separate steps, some of which require months of training. A crucial concern in handling mRNA, which is notoriously fragile, is rigorously avoiding outside contamination. Workers, who typically have degrees in disciplines such as biology or pharmacy, must wear two protective suits, boots and full-head coverings that take 20 minutes to put on. Last week the company showed journalists some of the production equipment, including the bioreactor, a metal drum where the mRNA is produced from raw material fed in by tubes and carefully monitored. One batch can contain enough mRNA for 8 million doses in a bag not much bigger than a large sack of rice. It is then filtered and combined with lipids, or fatty molecules, that form tiny particles which encapsulate the mRNA and protect it after injection into the human body. The final step is filling the vials, carried out by external partners. The German government has come under heavy fire at home for letting the European Union handle the procurement of  , resulting in a far more limited supply than that obtained by Britain or the United States. The safety and         supply troubles with another vaccine, made by British-Swedish company AstraZeneca, has further highlighted how reliant the EU is on research and manufacturing outside the bloc. Stung by the criticism, and conscious of Germany's upcoming national election, Berlin has thrown its weight behind the Marburg plant, helping push the necessary paperwork through the German bureaucracy. Christoph Krupp, the government's vaccine production czar, said companies are ramping up their capacity, buying new equipment and hiring more staff. Meanwhile, the government is trying to reassure them that those investments aren't going to go to waste. “We want to prepare ourselves to maintain the production structures that we are building up now in the medium term, because we do not know how the pandemic is evolving,” Krupp said. “We do not know how the virus mutates... we do not know if there will be another pandemic.” In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily, Krupp said this will require some level of state aid, and that the government is considering a vaccine production reserve of 500 million doses per quarter, or about 2 billion a year. In practice that means another one or two plants like the one in Marburg will be needed in the European Union. While these would likely prioritize orders placed by the bloc, there is no outright export ban on   from the EU, meaning other regions could benefit too. The government may be hoping that its investment will pay off. According to economists cited by Germany’s ifo-Institute, having a vaccine available at short notice could result in a net benefit for each German of up to $1,750 a year. ——— Jordans reported from Berlin. ——— Follow all of AP’s pandemic coverage at         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic,         https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine and         https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak .",4
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/global-trade-rebounding-lagging-vaccinations-pose-threat-76790348,business,"FRANKFURT, Germany -- The World Trade Organization is raising its estimate for the rebound in global trade in goods but warning that the COVID-19 pandemic still poses the greatest threat to a recovery that is being hampered by lagging vaccinations, regional disparities and weakness in the service industry. Demand in North America should be a major factor driving rebounding demand for goods thanks to the large fiscal relief and stimulus spending by the U.S. government. WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala called for a better access to   for people in in poorer countries. Rapid development of   have given the world a chance to halt the pandemic, “but this opportunity could be squandered if large numbers of countries and people do not have equal access to vaccines, she said Wednesday. ""A rapid, global and equitable vaccine rollout is the best stimulus that we have,” Okonjo-Iweala said at a news conference presenting the annual trade forecast. She called for better distribution of vaccine production facilities across the world so poor countries do not have to “stand in line” for vaccines. “The inequity of access is glaring, and this cannot happen again,” Okonjo-Iweala said. That the container ship mishap that temporarily shut down freight traffic in the Suez Canal could cause so much disruption was a sign that trade in goods remains “relatively robust,” she said. Meanwhile, services businesses are in more trouble, and the balance of risks are tilted to the downside. The WTO said it expects merchandise trade to rise by 8.0% in 2021, after having fallen 5.3% in 2020. Trade growth should then slow to 4.0% in 2022, a recovery that will still leave trade below its pre-pandemic level. The 2020 drop was less than expected due to the robust second half rebound thanks to strong monetary and fiscal support by many governments. The Geneva-based international organization foresaw a slide of 9.2% in its estimate released in October. “Prospects for a quick recovery in world trade have improved as merchandise trade expanded more rapidly than expected in the second half of last year,” the WTO said in a statement. “The strong rebound in global trade since the middle of last year has helped soften the blow of the pandemic for people, businesses, and economies,” Okonjo-Iweala said. ""But as long as large numbers of people and countries are excluded from sufficient vaccine access, it will stifle growth, and risk reversing the   and economic recovery worldwide.""",4
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/robinhood-cans-confetti-unveils-celebratory-designs-76787886,business,"NEW YORK -- The bursts of confetti that shower screens of Robinhood investors when they make their first trade — and serve as the punchline for critics who say the popular app treats investing like a game — are going away. Starting this week, Robinhood will begin retiring the confetti, which was meant to celebrate customers hitting milestones like making their first deposit or enabling new features, such as upgrading to its paid Gold-level membership. The last pops will go off next week, to be replaced with a suite of animations that are decidedly measured in pace, with nary a flake within them. “They're meant to be moments of pause, moments of understanding,” said Rich Bessel, head of design at Robinhood. Robinhood's popularity has exploded since it launched in 2013. Its commission-free trades and easy-to-use app have drawn in so many first-time investors and helped it grow so fast that the company is preparing to sell its own stock for the first time in an initial public offering. The confetti animations have been around since 2016, and critics say it's one of a number of techniques Robinhood uses to lure unsophisticated investors and keep them engaged with the app, where they may be making too many trades that are too risky for them. Massachusetts regulators last year cited the confetti in particular as part of           against Robinhood, alleging that it targets and manipulates inexperienced investors. A culture has built up on the internet where people post pictures of huge losses they took from bad trades — dubbed “loss porn” — and many show screenshots of their Robinhood account balances to prove it. Robinhood allows some investors to trade stock options and to buy using borrowed money, like other brokers, which can supercharge gains and losses. Madhu Muthukumar, Robinhood's senior director of product management, said the confetti criticism became a distraction that took away from the encouragement the company was trying to provide as people stepped into investing for the first time. The typical age for a Robinhood customer is 31, and many of them used to be among the nearly half of all U.S. households that don’t own any stocks or stock funds. Experts say it’s important to get more people invested in stocks, which historically have offered one of the best ways to build wealth over the long term. “So we just took out the distraction"" of the confetti, Muthukumar said. “For some reason, the conversation seemed centered around that."" In its response to the Massachusetts complaint, Robinhood said that digital confetti is legal and that the secretary of the commonwealth’s securities division ""also fails to appreciate that a first trade for many Robinhood customers — especially those who have been previously excluded from the markets — is an important milestone to celebrate."" Some research has also pushed back on the notion that traders on Robinhood are all making suckers' bets. When the stock market was plunging a year ago as the pandemic panic rocked global stock markets, for example, Robinhood investors didn't dump their holdings, as the stereotype of “dumb money” would suggest. Instead, they saw it as a chance to buy low and collectively increased their holdings, according to research by Ivo Welch, a finance professor at UCLA's Anderson School of Management. The S&P 500 has soared more than 50% over the last year. And experts aren't universally against the gamification of investing as a concept in general, if it helps bring more non-investors into the market. Chester Spatt, a finance professor at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, said active trading of stocks may not be as beneficial over the long term as simply holding a low-cost stock index fund, even if the trading is commission free. But it can still be better than leaving your money in a savings account. “It's not an absolute evil because it is helping bring people into the capital markets,” Spatt said. ""And I think that’s a healthy thing, if people take away from that the right sort of lessons.""",4
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/german-unemployment-slightly-lower-march-76784669,business,"BERLIN -- Unemployment in  , Europe's biggest economy, was slightly lower in March thanks to seasonal factors, official data showed Wednesday. Extensive use of a short-term salary support program continued to keep the figures in check amid ongoing   restrictions. The unadjusted jobless rate, the headline figure in  , slipped to 6.2% from 6.3% in February. Nearly 2.83 million people were registered as unemployed in the nation of 83 million — 77,000 fewer than the previous month and 492,000 more than a year earlier. In seasonally adjusted terms, the unemployment rate stood at 6% for the third consecutive month, though 8,000 fewer people were out of work than in February, the Federal Labor Agency said. Restaurants, bars, sports and many leisure facilities have been closed since Nov. 2 and hotels are allowed only to accommodate business travelers. Hairdressers and nonessential shops were able to reopen in March, with virus-related limits. However, infections have risen significantly in recent weeks and restrictions may be reimposed. Industry has not been directly affected by lockdown measures. Rises in unemployment in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, and elsewhere on the continent have been moderate by international standards. That is because employers are making heavy use of salary support programs, often referred to as furlough schemes, which allow them to keep employees on the payroll while they await better times. In Germany, the labor agency pays at least 60% of the salary of employees who are on reduced or zero hours. The labor agency said it paid support for 2.85 million people in December, the most recent month it has estimates for. That was up from 2.6 million in December but still far below a peak of nearly 6 million last April. Separately, Germany's statistics agency said Wednesday that the number of businesses filing for insolvency in 2020 dropped 15.5% from the year before to 15,841. That, however, was largely because, due to the pandemic, authorities suspended rules requiring overly indebted companies to file for insolvency.",0
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/automakers-bmw-volvo-back-moratorium-deep-seabed-mining-76784243,business,"BERLIN -- Automakers   and Volvo announced Wednesday that they support a moratorium on deep seabed mining for minerals used in electric vehicle batteries and other products. In a statement also backed by Samsung’s EV battery unit and tech giant Google, the companies cited the importance of protecting fragile ocean ecosystems that are already under threat from overfishing, pollution, noise and man-made climate change. While deep seabed mining is still in its infancy, several prospecting firms are seeking rights to extract potentially lucrative deposits from the depths of the ocean, particularly the metallic nodules that build up around hydrothermal vents. “Before any potential deep seabed mining occurs, it needs to be clearly demonstrated that such activities can be managed in a way that ensures the effective protection of the marine  ,” the four companies said in their statement. “All alternatives to deep sea minerals must be explored as a matter of urgency, with a focus on reducing demand for primary metals, transitioning to a resource-efficient, closed-loop materials economy, and developing responsible terrestrial mining practices,” they said. The companies said they were committed “not to source minerals from the deep seabed; to exclude such minerals from our supply chains; and not to finance deep seabed mining activities.” The call was supported by the  al group World Wildlife Fund, which has campaigned against deep seabed mining. “We need to take pressures off the ocean, not add additional pressures to it in order to guarantee that the ocean can provide services to humanity, such as climate regulation, food and medicines, into the future,” said Jessica Battle, who heads the WWF campaign against deep seabed mining. While minerals mined from the ocean floor can be used for a variety of goods, they are of particular interest to high-tech industries that rely on precious and rare metals. “At least one of the leading nodule mining contractors, DeepGreen, cites generating metals for EV batteries as their major motivation for large-scale mining,” said Craig Smith, a professor of oceanography at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management in Germany, said the announcement by BMW and Volvo was significant for other car manufacturers. “It underlines the importance of ecological considerations in a comprehensive well-to-wheel perspective,"" he said, adding that other automakers “will now at least hesitate to use minerals mined from the ocean in their electric vehicle batteries.” Global Sea Mineral Resources, a company exploring deep seabed mining, said it supports the call for a moratorium but claimed environmental surveys are already required by the International Seabed Authority, which regulates the industry. “GSR will only apply for a mining contract if the science shows that, from an environmental and social perspective, deep seabed minerals have advantages over the alternative – which is to rely solely on new and current mines on land,” said Kris van Nijen, the company’s managing director.",0
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/edmunds-puts-teslas-range-test-76787921,business,"Edmunds’ test team recently published the results of its real-world range testing for electric vehicles. Notably, every Tesla the team tested in 2020 came up short of matching the EPA’s range estimate. Almost all other EVs Edmunds tested met or exceeded those estimates. That result, as you can likely guess, ruffled some feathers at Tesla headquarters. A CHALLENGE FROM TESLA The lackluster results prompted the automaker to reach out to the Edmunds test team. Tesla’s engineers disputed our figures and argued that by stopping our EV range tests at zero indicated miles, rather than pressing on until the battery died, we were underestimating their vehicles’ true range. Tesla said its vehicles have a safety buffer that ensures drivers can keep going even when the indicated range displayed zero miles. And when you factored in this buffer, Tesla argued, it would allow their vehicles to match the EPA range estimates, which are typically measured when the battery is fully depleted. It was a challenge we at Edmunds were up for, so we rented a 7.5-mile-long closed-course oval at an unaffiliated automaker’s proving ground in California’s Mojave Desert. This facility allowed us to safely drive five EVs until their battery power completely ran out. Tesla provided a Model 3 Long Range for us to test. We also brought along the Edmunds-owned Model 3 Standard Range Plus and Model Y Performance used in our original range testing, plus two non-Teslas for comparison purposes: a Ford Mustang Mach-E and an   ID.4. These were also provided by their manufacturers. THE TEST Most in-car range meters factor in your recent driving habits when forecasting the remaining range. Edmunds’ editors needed to drive the vehicles in the same manner to normalize the range meters and provide a level playing field. At the test track, we drove the five EVs at a common highway speed of 65 mph, with the automatic climate control set to 72 degrees, audio off, no accessories plugged in, and with drivers rotating in one-hour shifts, until the batteries were depleted. Once each vehicle’s range estimate indicated zero miles, we measured how far it could go before coming to a complete stop. Miles Traveled Past Zero Ford Mustang Mach-E Extended Range: 7.3 miles Tesla Model Y Performance: 12.6 miles Volkswagen ID.4: 12.9 miles Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus: 17.6 miles Tesla Model 3 Long Range: 25.9 miles Notice how the buffer can vary even within the same brand. The Model 3 Long Range went twice as far as the Model Y. What’s more, there was no indication how far you could keep going since all vehicles simply read zero miles remaining. For all we knew, the cars could stop at any moment. BOLSTERING OUR RESULTS We also ran a control test on the Edmunds’ EV range route with the Model 3 Long Range and Model Y Performance, driving them to the end of their battery life on public roads. The Model Y traveled 11 miles past zero and the Model 3 went an extra 17.5 miles; both were less than the buffers we experienced at the test track. We asked Tesla about this discrepancy in the reserve range. The automaker said that the buffer was based on a combination of near-past conditions and instantaneous conditions, essentially the weather and terrain variation, which was why “the buffer cannot be defined exactly to a number every time.” TAKEAWAYS FOR THE EV SHOPPER Some Teslas would be capable of meeting their EPA estimates in Edmunds’ real-world range test if we included their reserve battery range, or the distance we traveled running beyond the point of zero indicated miles left. But even in this scenario, there would be requirements such as driving conservatively in a temperate climate and using Tesla’s maximum battery charge, even though Tesla recommends this for long-distance trips only. The majority of Teslas we’ve tested so far — four of the six — do not meet their EPA estimates even allowing for a safety buffer. Furthermore, almost every other EV Edmunds has tested met or exceeded EPA estimates without the need to include their safety buffers. Potential Tesla shoppers should know that to use the full range as advertised, they need to feel comfortable going past the zero indicated mile mark. This is not only risky, but it also requires the owner to deeply discharge the battery, which isn’t recommended for the long-term health of the battery. EDMUNDS SAYS: Edmunds’ EV range test isn’t meant to be the definitive word on a vehicle’s range but rather a real-world complement to the laboratory-based EPA testing. We’ll continue to test to an indicated zero because we’d never advise customers to rely on the unpredictable buffer range. ——————— This story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website         Edmunds.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/sports-cards-virtual-big-76789324,business,"SILVER SPRING, Md. -- Maybe the Luka Doncic rookie   card that recently sold at auction for a record $4.6 million was a bit rich for your blood. Perhaps you’d be interested in a more affordable alternative — say, a virtual card of the Dallas Mavericks forward currently listed for a mere $150,000? Not long ago, there’s no way you’d plunk down even $1.50 for a digital image that could be copied for free. But sports trading cards have gone convincingly digital, complete with rare collector’s items and the adrenaline rush of opening a fresh pack -- minus the stale, shattered plank of powdery bubblegum you might remember from childhood. These digital cards, dubbed “moments,” appear on screen as spinning, floating digital cubes that each feature a video highlight of an NBA player. They sprang into existence just five months ago, after the Canadian tech startup Dapper Labs convinced the NBA that it could not only prevent cheap -- well, free -- knock-offs, it could help the NBA make a few bucks in the process. Dapper announced Tuesday that it had secured $305 million in new private funding from a group that includes former NBA great Michael Jordan and more than a dozen current players. The company said the new round of funding will help it expand its NFT and blockchain products to other sports leagues and a wide range of businesses. What makes all this possible is a clever use of the cryptocurrency technology called blockchain, which allows the creation of permanent certificates of ownership that can't be copied or deleted. It's the same technique that recently allowed the artist known as Beeple to sell a digital work for almost $70 million. Most moments -- typically ones in heavy circulation -- cost around $20 and often below $10. Of course, the biggest transactions — a LeBron James dunk recently went for $210,000 — get the most attention. Despite some early tech hiccups, the NBA says it is “thrilled” with the response from fans, who bombard the Top Shot website every time new packs of cards drop. Each such pack drop injects thousands of new cards into the market, offering buyers an affordable way to add to their collections. The cheapest packs have three “common” cards and cost $9. More expensive packs with more and rarer cards can cost almost $1000. Fans halfway around the world are setting their alarms in the middle of the night just to get in line for a chance to buy a pack. Videos of the flashy pack openings are logging tens of thousands of views all over YouTube. Even NBA players are getting in on the action. “I’m not going to lie, it makes me feel like I’m a kid again,” Orlando Magic guard Terrence Ross said. “At lunch, at school trading NBA cards -- it’s fun.” Since the beta went live in October, Top Shot says it has registered more than 800,000 users and rung up nearly $500 million in sales. March sales should easily surpass February sales of $232 million, which was about five times January turnover. “It’s happened really quickly,” said Dapper Labs CEO Roham Gharegozlou. “We’re sort of scrambling to keep up.” After a year of playing games to empty arenas amid the pandemic, the NBA is ecstatic about the frenzy. Dapper Labs, the NBA and its players share a 5% fee on peer-to-peer transactions; the league also gets a cut of the pack drop sales. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told The Associated Press: “I think we’re just scratching the surface on what the potential is for blockchain to completely transform the digital collectibles industry.” Yes, he said “blockchain.” Each Top Shot card comes with a non-fungible token, or NFT, that confirms an item’s ownership by recording the details on a decentralized digital ledger known as the blockchain. NFTs can be used to trace an object’s digital origin, allowing one to prove ownership. It also creates a somewhat artificial scarcity that can juice a product’s value. Aaron Perzanowski, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University and co-author of the book “The End of Ownership,” said the NFT craze is partly a response to consumers’ genuine desire to reclaim a sense of ownership in an increasingly digital, intangible economy. “Granted, right now, that desire is expressing itself through a seemingly frivolous and exploitative trend that, to most of us, looks irrational,” Perzanowski said. Gharegozlou insists that Top Shot won’t end up like Dapper's previous project, CryptoKitties, a digital cat-breeding and trading game that saw virtual cats selling for six figures before crashing. The company said problems that plagued CryptoKitties -- skyrocketing blockchain costs and the inability to control its digital inventory — aren't an issue for Top Shot. Dapper promotes Top Shot as both a fun hobby for collectors and an opportunity for investors. “It's like stock market investing reimagined for fans,” according to one promotional email. Just like anyone starting to invest in stocks, novice Top Shot investors would be wise to learn the vernacular, study the marketplace and listen to more experienced players. Because all minted cards and transactions are openly documented on the blockchain, a growing number of websites crunch that data for users to analyze before buying or selling. There are also free tutorials on the internet. Cards are valued by several different factors, including some unique measures based on their serial numbers. Unsurprisingly, moments of the league’s best players tend to be more valuable. The rarer a moment is, the more expensive it's likely to be. The lower the card number is in a series, the more it should fetch on the market. And if your ownership serial number happens to match the jersey number of the player featured? Ka-ching. Dean Brostek, who runs a sports consultancy and data intelligence business in Melbourne, Australia, considers himself both a collector and investor. The 43-year-old's interest in the NBA had waned until his teenage son picked up   a few years ago. Then he read about Top Shot and decided to give it a whirl. After a few misses, some related to dealing with the 18-hour time difference in the wee hours, Brostek finally got his pack, opened it with his kids and posted the video online. “It was really cool,” he said. “They’ve done a really nice job of creating a bit of theater.”",1
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/deliveroo-shares-tumble-uk-stock-market-debut-76784906,business,"LONDON -- Shares of app-based meal delivery service Deliveroo, which saw its business boosted by pandemic lockdowns, tumbled by as much as a third in their U.K.   debut on Wednesday. The London-based company's shares slid even after they were priced at the bottom of the potential range, reflecting investor wariness about whether Deliveroo could turn a profit and broader market turbulence for tech-related stocks. The slump also reflects a growing backlash against “gig economy"" companies, with half a dozen leading U.K. fund managers abstaining from the IPO amid concerns about working conditions for Deliveroo's delivery riders, and its shareholder structure. Shares in Deliveroo Holdings, which competes with Uber Eats and whose backers include Amazon, ended the day down 26% from their offer price of 390 pence, after falling as much as a third in early trading. Deliveroo's initial public offering was one of Europe's biggest and most hotly anticipated this year. The company raised 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) from selling new shares, while existing shareholders sold another 500 million pounds worth of shares, in a   listing that values the company at 7.6 billion pounds. Founded by CEO Will Shu, an American ex-banker, Deliveroo operates in a dozen countries in Europe and Asia. Every month more than 6 million customers order food from restaurants and shops through the Deliveroo app, according to its prospectus. Bicycle and scooter riders lugging insulated bags in the company’s signature robin’s egg blue are ubiquitous on the streets of London. “In this next phase of our journey as a public company we will continue to invest in the innovations that help restaurants and grocers to grow their businesses, to bring customers more choice than ever before, and to provide riders with more work,” Shu         said in a statement. Deliveroo has never turned a profit since it was founded in 2013 though it benefited last year from the coronavirus pandemic, which helped narrow its annual loss to $309 million. Lockdown restrictions sent demand for takeout food soaring and increased its overall transactions, but analysts wonder if the lift will last. “The pandemic has offered a structural growth opportunity, but it’s worth asking if lockdowns mean things are as good as they will ever be for a takeaway service,"" Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a research note. ""The longer-term outlook depends on how demand holds up in a post-pandemic world, and if that road to profitability looks any clearer.” Wave Roberts, a Deliveroo motorcycle rider in Reading, England, said any pandemic revenue bump “came out of our pocket as couriers,” because the company has been cutting its fees. Deliveroo pays up to 3.30 pounds for a delivery up to 1 mile from a restaurant, down from 5.10 pounds three years ago, said Roberts, who's also vice chair of a couriers' union. After deducting expenses including fuel, insurance and taxes, Roberts takes home about 7 pounds an hour, less than the U.K. minimum wage. As part of the IPO, Deliveroo promised longtime riders bonuses of up to 10,000 pounds. Roberts, who didn't get anything, dismissed it as a public relations exercise by the company “to make them look ethical and friendly."" Some of the U.K.’s biggest fund managers lost their appetite for investing over similar concerns. One fund manager, M&G, said Deliveroo's reliance on gig workers presented a risk to “the sustainability of its business model."" Having a flexible workforce has been key to the company's success, but the threat of tighter regulation looms. The U.K.'s top court recently ruled that Uber drivers should be classed as “workers"" and not self-employed, entitling them to benefits such as minimum wage and pensions. ——— For all of AP’s tech coverage, visit         https://apnews.com/apf-technology ——— Follow Kelvin Chan at www.twitter.com/chanman",4
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/feb-us-home-contract-signings-tumble-now-lag-76789027,business,"SILVER SPRING, Md. -- The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes last month fell by the most since last year's virus outbreak sent the economy into freefall. The National Association of Realtors’ index of pending home sales tumbled 10.6% to 110.3 in February, its lowest level since May of last year. Combined with a 2.4% dip in January, contract signings are now 0.5% behind where they were last year after eight straight months of year-over-year gains. Contract signings are considered a barometer of purchases that will take place in the next two months. Earlier this month, the Commerce Department reported that home construction fell sharply, slipping 10.3% in February due to severe winter weather in much of the country. Applications for new building permits, considered a good indication of future activity, fell for the first time since October. Even though interest rates have ticked up recently, economists have been optimistic that housing will bounce back in coming months. Rising demand has been fueled by Americans who have been cooped up as the   pandemic drags on past the one-year mark. Contract signings in all four regions fell in February and all are now behind last year's pace. The Midwest is lagging behind last year by the most, with a decline of 6.1%. The South, West and Northeast are all between about 2% and 4% behind last year's pace.",0
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/ap-norc-poll-biden-bolstered-strong-marks-pandemic-76794014,business,"WASHINGTON -- Americans are broadly supportive of President  ’s early handling of the   pandemic, a new poll finds, and approval of his stewardship of the economy has ticked up following passage of a sprawling         $1.9 trillion relief bill. But Americans are more critical of Biden’s early approach to some of the hot-button issues that are moving to the forefront, including guns and  , according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The president has outlined goals for tackling both issues but has made clear that they are not his immediate legislative priorities. “I’m going to deal with all those problems. The question is the priorities as they come and land on my plate,” Biden said in a news conference last week. Biden's early weeks in office have made it abundantly clear that his top priority is curtailing the pandemic: urging Americans to take precautionary measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, prioritizing the rollout of   and pushing the relief bill through Congress in a party line vote. Vaccine distribution has soared since Biden took office, with more than 96 million Americans having received at least one dose. Americans have responded favorably to the president's approach, with 73% approving of his handling of the pandemic. That includes about half of Republicans, a rarity given how divided Americans have been along party lines on many key issues in recent years. Gwen Medley, a nurse from Galveston, Texas, who has been administering   in her state, is among them. The 66-year-old Republican is critical of Biden on a range of other issues, including immigration, but said the president is doing a “pretty good job” on the pandemic so far — in part, she says, because of vaccine efforts he inherited from the Trump administration. “Trump got the ball rolling, and Biden is continuing to push that ball,” Medley said. Notably, Biden’s approval rating on the economy has ticked up slightly since passage of the relief bill, which included direct payments to millions of Americans and aid to schools and state and local governments. Sixty percent of Americans now say they approve of Biden’s handling of the economy, compared with 55%         a month ago. Overall, Biden’s job approval sits at a healthy 61% as he enters his third month in office, according to the AP-NORC survey. That's well above the approval ratings for his predecessor, Donald Trump, at this same point in his presidency. Trump's overall approval rating never topped 50% in an AP-NORC survey. Biden and his advisers contend that despite the litany of issues facing the country, he will be judged foremost on his handling of the pandemic, now in its second year. The virus has killed more than 550,000 people in the U.S., and even with vaccines more accessible, some states are experiencing a surge in cases as new variants take hold. “Our work is far from over,” Biden said this week as he implored states to keep mask mandates and other restrictions in place. “The war against COVID-19 is far from won. This is deadly serious.” Much of Biden's efforts have been in sharp contrast to Trump, who emphasized the need to keep businesses open and the U.S. economy humming, even if that meant flouting public health guidelines for controlling the pandemic. Biden has flipped that approach, but also tried to supplement the economy through the legislation he signed into law in early March. No Republicans in Congress voted for the measure, with some arguing that it unnecessarily added to the federal budget deficit at a time when the economy was already moving in a more positive direction. Americans are split over Biden's handling of the deficit, with 48% saying they approve and 50% saying they disapprove. The majority of Democrats — 77% — approve, while the majority of Republicans — 83% — disapprove. Biden faces a similar partisan divide on gun policy and immigration, two issues that have quickly disrupted Biden's carefully laid plans for his opening months in office. On gun policy, 45% say they back Biden's approach, while 52% disapprove. The survey was conducted after a pair of deadly mass shootings, one in Atlanta that killed eight people, including six Asian Americans, and another at a grocery store in Colorado that left 10 people dead. Biden         has said he's considering executive actions to tighten gun restrictions, but has also said he believes “rational” legislation could pass the narrowly divided Senate. He's called on the Senate, in particular, to pass measures already approved by the House that would expand background checks, though he's putting his own political muscle first into a $2 trillion infrastructure package the White House unveiled this week. Biden is also         confronting mounting concerns along the U.S.-Mexico border, where the number of families and migrant children arriving is on the rise. Republicans have blamed the increases on Biden's swift rollback of some of Trump's most aggressive immigration deterrent policies, moves the White House has warned should not be viewed as an open invitation to cross the border. The White House, in turn, has blamed the situation at the border in large part on the conditions it inherited from the Trump administration. In addition to his executive actions, Biden has unveiled a legislative proposal that would provide an eight-year path to citizenship for millions of people currently in the U.S. illegally. So far, just 42% say they approve of how Biden is handling immigration, and a similar share, 44%, say they approve of how he’s handling border security. While much of Biden's early focus has been on domestic matters, foreign policy concerns also loom. The president has a 55% approval rating on foreign policy, putting that issue slightly below his overall job performance. The poll also finds Americans cite the threat to the U.S. from the spread of infectious diseases and the threat from extremist militant groups as among their top concerns, along with China's influence around the world. Democrats and Republicans have differing concerns about the greatest threats facing the United States. Democrats are more likely than Republicans to cite the spread of infectious diseases (69% to 47%), extremist militant groups (67% to 51%) and climate change (76% to 22%) as threats to the U.S. They also are slightly more concerned about Russia's global influence (50% to 42%). Republicans are more likely than Democrats to be very concerned about the threat posed by illegal immigration (72% to 22%), China’s influence around the world (68% to 44%), the Iranian nuclear program (58% vs 39%), and the North Korean nuclear program (51% to 41%). ——— The AP-NORC poll of 1,166 adults was conducted March 26-29 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/iraqi-parliament-approves-budget-89-billion-2021-76797709,business,"BAGHDAD -- Iraq’s parliament on Wednesday approved the state budget for 2021, after weeks of wrangling amid a severe economic and financial crisis spurred by low oil prices and the pandemic. The new budget was approved at a late night session at 129 trillion  i dinars ($89 billion) and a budget deficit estimated at 28.7 trillion trillion  i dinars ($19.79 billion). The 2021 budget set an oil price of $45 a barrel with expected oil exports of 3.25 million barrels per day. Oil-rich Iraq is going through an acute economic and financial crisis largely due to low crude prices. In December, Iraq's Central Bank devalued the Iraqi dinar by over 20% in response to a severe liquidity crisis, a measure that sparked public outrage as the government struggled to cover its expenses. It was the first reduction in exchange rates that the Iraqi government has made in decades. Since an oil price crash last year, Iraq has been grappling with an unprecedented liquidity crisis. The crude-exporting country has had to borrow from the bank’s dollar reserves to pay the nearly $5 billion in monthly fees for public salaries and pensions.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/yellen-regulatory-panel-2020-market-turmoil-76797883,business,"WASHINGTON -- Last year’s  -triggered market turmoil exposed vulnerable areas in the U.S. economy that need to be addressed by the nation's top-level financial supervisory group, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Wednesday. Yellen told members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council that she wants the panel to examine what needs to be done to better protect the financial system from further turmoil. It should also study the impact of climate change on the stability of financial institutions, she said. “Almost exactly one year ago, the pandemic’s outbreak caused significant stress in the economy and in the financial system,” Yellen told the panel during its public session. “In response to the deep uncertainty, investors sought safety in the form of cash and sort-term government securities. Bond markets became illiquid.” Yellen said that the country is now “digging out of a deep hole,” but she said the hole could have been even deeper if not for swift rescue actions by the Federal Reserve, Treasury and Congress and by the regulations passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. “But the fact that extreme policy interventions were still required to support market functioning should serve as a clear reminder: We have to do more to address vulnerabilities in the financial system,” Yellen said. Her comments marked a change in tone from the Trump administration. Then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other panel members searched for ways to lessen the burden of financial regulations that had been imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The stability panel, which was created by the Dodd-Frank law to address failures to coordinate oversight, includes the heads of government regulatory agencies including Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Securities and Exchange Commission. While Wednesday’s session was Yellen’s first as chair of the panel, she had served as a member for the four years she served as chair of the Fed. Yellen said the examination of last year’s financial market turmoil would include a review of potential reforms for money market mutual funds and the operation of hedge funds. Yellen said the council’s review would also address ways to make the Treasury securities market more resilient to future disruptions. The council will also examine ways to make financial institutions more resilient to the threats imposed by climate change, she said. “We know that storms will hit us with more frequency and more intensity,” Yellen said. “Our financial system must be prepared for the market and credit risks of these climate-related events.”",0

The company had previously given its return-to-office date as June 30, but questions remained as to whether the company would allow some of its 60,000 Seattle-area office employees to continue working from home part time. The Seattle Times         reports the company told employees Tuesday it is planning a “return to an office-centric culture as our baseline.” Amazon and Microsoft were among the first large companies to mostly shutter their main offices in the Seattle area during the first COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020. Amazon will not require office workers to receive a COVID-19 vaccine before they return, but the company is encouraging employees and contractors to get vaccinated as soon as they are eligible, according to   spokesperson Jose Negrete.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/unwelcome-prank-volkswagen-purposely-hoodwinks-reporters-76780835,business,"NEW YORK -- Journalists are used to being wary about odd pranksters pulling April Fool's Day hoaxes at this time of year. Few expect it from a multi-billion dollar corporation. Volkswagen admitted Tuesday that it had put out a false news release saying that it had changed the name of its U.S. subsidiary to “Voltswagen of America” in an attempt to be funny and promote a new electric utility vehicle. Several news organizations, including The Associated Press, USA Today, CNBC and The Washington Post, had reported the original press release as real news, some after being assured specifically that it was no joke. The deception even briefly lifted stock prices for the company, according to         The Wall Street Journal, which first revealed the deception by reaching an official at the company headquarters in Germany. “The Associated Press was repeatedly assured by Volkswagen that its U.S. subsidiary planned a name change, and reported that information, which we now know to be false,"" company spokeswoman Lauren Easton said. “We have corrected our story and published a new one based on the company’s admission. This and any deliberate release of false information hurts accurate journalism and the public good.” The story emerged Monday after a news release was briefly posted on a company website and then disappeared, but not before catching some eyes. CNBC, which declined comment on the hoax, is believed to be the first major news organization to report it as legitimate news. The AP wrote a story about it Monday after its reporter was assured by Mark Gillies, a company spokesman in the United States, that it was serious, Easton said. It was a similar story at USA Today, where a reporter specifically asked if it was a joke and was told “no,” said the newspaper's spokeswoman, Chrissy Terrell. “The company used this fake announcement as a way to manipulate respected reporters from trusted news outlets to get attention for their marketing campaign,” she said. “We are disheartened that the company would choose this type of disingenuous marketing.” The USA Today reporter who was initially lied to was more blunt. “This was not a joke,” reporter         Nathan Bomey wrote on Twitter. “It was deception. In case you haven't noticed, we have a misinformation problem in this country. Now you're part of it. Why should anyone trust you again?” At first on Tuesday, the company doubled down on its story by reissuing the news release, which quoted Scott Keogh, the president and CEO of Volkswagen of America. It even changed its Twitter page, announcing that “we know, 66 is an unusual age to change your name, but we've always been young at heart.” There's some precedent for a company trying a “fake news” joke. In 2018,         the food chain IHOP briefly tried to convince consumer it was exchanging the “P"" in its name to “B,” trading pancakes for burgers. Gillies, after presenting the false information the day before, came clean on Tuesday. The Journal quoted a spokesman for the company in Germany as saying, “we didn't mean to mislead anyone. The whole thing is just a marketing action to get people talking” about its new car model. The AP and other news organizations that falsely reported the news later wrote about the hoax. “About that plan to change Volkswagen of America's name.” wrote USA Today's Mike Snider. “Never mind.” “Perhaps we should consider whether (the) marketing campaign was funnier in the original German?” said Juleanna Glover, a corporate consultant and founder of the firm Ridgely Walsh. Glover said the company landed millions of dollars in publicity from a press release. “I am sure VW regrets the move for now but a good marketing team will find the path to capitalize on the word play,” she said. Shon Hiatt, a professor of management and organization at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business, said campaigns with humor aren't necessarily problematic if presented in a tongue-in-cheek way and not as falsehoods to reporters. “I don't think it will hurt them,” Hiatt said. “I just don't think it gave them the full potential boost they wanted.” ——— AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",0
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-batch-fails-quality-76799269,business,"A batch of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine failed quality standards and can’t be used, the drug giant said Wednesday. The drugmaker didn’t say how many doses were lost, and it wasn’t clear how the problem would impact future deliveries. A vaccine ingredient made by Emergent BioSolutions — one of about 10 companies that Johnson & Johnson is using to speed up manufacturing of its recently approved vaccine — did not meet quality standards, J&J said. J&J said the Emergent BioSolutions factory involved had not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make part of the vaccine. Emergent declined to comment. J&J had pledged to provide 20 million doses of its vaccine to the U.S. government by the end of March, and 80 million more doses by the end of May. Its statement on the manufacturing problem said it was still planning to deliver 100 million doses by the end of June and was “aiming to deliver those doses by the end of May.” President Joe Biden has pledged to have enough vaccines for all U.S. adults by the end of May. The U.S. government has ordered enough two-dose shots from Pfizer and Moderna to vaccinate 200 million people to be delivered by late May, plus the 100 million shots from J&J. A federal official said Wednesday evening the administration’s goal can be met without additional J&J doses. A J&J spokesman said earlier Wednesday that the company met the end-of-March goal, but did not respond to questions about whether the Emergent plant in Baltimore, known as Bayview, had been cleared by FDA. As of Wednesday, J&J had provided about 6.8 million doses to the U.S. vaccine effort, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s online vaccine tracker. Some additional doses may not yet have been recorded as delivered, and federal health officials said Wednesday that another 11 million doses of the vaccine would be available for shipments starting on Thursday. It was not immediately clear where those 11 million doses originated, but J&J has been shipping finished vaccines from its factory in the Netherlands to the U.S. Emergent, a little known pharmaceutical company granted a major role in the federal government’s response to coronavirus pandemic, has been repeatedly cited by the FDA for problems ranging from poorly trained employees to cracked vials and mold around one of its facilities, according to records obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act. The records cover inspections at Emergent facilities, including Bayview, since 2017. Following a December 2017 inspection at an Emergent plant in Canton, Massachusetts, the FDA said the company hadn’t corrected “continued low level mold and yeast isolates” found in the facility. Nearly a year later, agency investigators questioned why Emergent had “an unwritten policy of not conducting routine compliance audits” at a separate plant in Baltimore, known as Camden, where an anthrax vaccine is filled into vials. Emergent’s revenues skyrocketed during the Trump administration, jumping from around $523 million in 2015 to more than $1.5 billion in 2020. The company has invested heavily in lobbying the federal government, according to disclosure records, which show the company spent $3.6 million on lobbying in 2020 alone. J&J said it was putting more of its manufacturing and quality experts inside Emergent’s factory to supervise production of the COVID-19 vaccine, a move meant to enable delivery of an additional 24 million vaccine doses through April. J&J said it still expects to deliver more than 1 billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year. The J&J vaccine has been viewed as crucial for vaccination campaigns around the world, because only one shot is required and it can be shipped and stored at standard refrigeration temperatures, unlike some other vials that must be kept frozen. The company also has pledged to sell the vaccine without a profit, but only during the pandemic emergency. The problem with the vaccine batch was first reported by The New York Times. The FDA said it was aware of the situation but declined further comment. ——— Johnson reported from Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, and Lardner from Washington.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/epa-chief-committed-restoring-scientific-integrity-76790178,business,"WASHINGTON -- In a move he said would help restore “scientific integrity,” the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency is removing dozens of scientists and other experts from key advisory boards named under President  , saying they were overly friendly to industry. EPA Administrator         Michael Regan, in an Associated Press interview, said the “reset” of the Science Advisory Board and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee will return EPA to its time-honored practice of relying on advice from a balanced group of experts. He is clearing out the two important panels, although current members can apply for reinstatement. “Scientific integrity is a foundational value for EPA,'' Regan said. “And I am committing to ensuring that every single decision we make meets rigorous scientific standards.’’ Restoring public confidence in the EPA is a top goal, Regan said. “And I think to do that, we have to identify and root out any decisions from the past that were not properly aligned with science,'' he said. Regan has repeatedly said “science is back."" He said that “is very true,"" but added that ""underpinning that is the importance of scientific integrity and transparency here at the agency. The actions we’re taking are indicative of how serious we are about repairing the scientific integrity at EPA.'' Regan, 44, was North Carolina’s top  al regulator for four years. At the EPA, he is helping to lead President Joe Biden’s efforts to address climate change and advocate for  al justice. Regan is the first Black man to run the EPA. The overhaul announced Wednesday ousts more than 40 members of the two science advisory boards, including some whose terms do not expire this year. Members can apply to keep serving, but must compete against other candidates. Regan will make final selections, expected within months. The panels provide scientific expertise and recommendations for air quality standards and other policies intended to protect public health and the environment. Democrats have said the decision by Donald Trump's first EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, to remove many academic scientists from the advisory panels tilted them in favor of the chemical and fossil fuel industries. Pruitt barred scientists from serving on the advisory boards if they had received EPA research grants. Pruitt later resigned amid ethics scandals but his policies were largely continued under his successor and former deputy, Andrew Wheeler. In a related development, Regan said the EPA will be part of a White House effort to investigate Trump-era political interference in science across the government. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy announced a task force Monday aimed at identifying past tampering in scientific decisions. “Science is a big part of our mission, and my expectation is that we will be a part of that exercise,'' Regan said, calling the emphasis on scientific integrity a return to past practice rather than a new initiative. “Science was not in question prior to the previous administration. There were some norms, some structures and transparency that we are actually returning back.'' John Graham, a former George W. Bush administration official who had led the Science Advisory Board since last year, defended that panel’s work, saying in an email it “exposed the scientific shortcomings of the Trump EPA’s plans to weaken greenhouse gas standards for autos and remove numerous water bodies from federal pollution protection.″ Graham said he was saddened by Regan’s “radical action,'' which he said is “disrupting” every board member’s service and hampering the panel's work. Graham, a professor at Indiana University's School of Public and Environmental Affairs, said he will not reapply “because I respectfully protest the entire process that Administrator Regan has concocted.'' Regan, in the AP interview, said his emphasis on scientific integrity also plays a major role in recruiting new and former employees as EPA attempts to rebuild after losing more than 10% of its workforce under Trump. “The people at EPA joined this agency for a specific reason. They believe in the mission. They believe in public service, and they want to protect public health and the environment,'' he said. “And so it's our job to make sure we have a work environment that promotes science, data, integrity and transparency. We’re going to have to walk that walk — demonstrate we are a worthy place of employment. I believe lots of people are already getting that message.″ On policy issues, Regan pledged to confront climate change, ensure environmental justice at communities near refineries and other hazardous sites and protect public health on issues such as a cluster of “forever chemicals” known as PFAS that are increasingly turning up in public drinking water systems, private wells and even food. A federal court’s recent decision to vacate the Trump administration’s replacement of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan gives Regan's team a “clean slate” to regulate coal-burning power plants that contribute to global warming, he said. Regan said he also is open to stricter air quality standards for ozone and other pollutants and will evaluate waivers offered by the Trump administration to relax a host of environmental rules during the coronavirus pandemic. Critics said the change allowed a “pandemic of pollution” in the past year. “Sometimes, ill-informed decisions that seem to be politically expedient end up not helping any parties,'' Regan said, referring to actions by Wheeler and Pruitt, his two immediate predecessors. Regan rejected criticism by some Republican senators that he will have less power than “unaccountable” White House officials, such as climate adviser Gina McCarthy, a former EPA chief, or climate envoy John Kerry, a former senator and secretary of state. “My job is prove that theory wrong, and it's my intent to do just that,'' he said, noting the EPA powers granted by Congress. “We set the agenda here, based on the president’s vision, and we are charged with protecting the public health and the environment,'' he said.",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/microsoft-wins-22-billion-deal-making-headsets-us-76795452,business,"Microsoft won a nearly $22 billion contract to         supply U.S. Army combat troops with its augmented reality headsets. Microsoft and the Army         separately announced the deal Wednesday. The technology is based on Microsoft's HoloLens headsets, which were originally intended for the video game and entertainment industries. Pentagon officials have described the futuristic technology — which the Army calls its Integrated Visual Augmentation System — as a way of boosting soldiers' awareness of their surroundings and their ability to spot targets and dangers. Microsoft’s head-mounted HoloLens displays let people see virtual imagery superimposed over the physical world in front of them — anything from holograms in virtual game worlds to repair instructions floating over a broken gadget. The Army's website says soldiers tested the gadgets last year at Fort Pickett in Virginia. It said the system could help troops gain an advantage “on battlefields that are increasingly urban, congested, dark and unpredictable.” The Army first began testing Microsoft's system with a $480 million contract in 2018 and said the headsets could be used for both training and in actual battle. The new contract will enable Microsoft to mass produce units for more than 120,000 soldiers in the Army Close Combat Force. Microsoft said the contract will amount to up to $21.88 billion over the next decade, with a five-year base agreement that can be extended for another five years. It's not clear how it corresponds to the $740 billion defense policy bill that Congress passed in January after overriding a veto by President Donald Trump. The bill affirmed a 3% pay raise for U.S. troops but included cuts to the headset initiative. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday that the technology is promising but its results must be closely tracked ""and it’s our job to raise issues if the technology isn’t meeting the needs of our troops now and in the future.” Microsoft President Brad Smith told Reed's committee in February that the system could integrate thermal night vision and facial recognition to provide soldiers with “real-time analytics” on remote battlefields. He also described how it could help in planning a hostage rescue operation by creating a “digital twin” of the building. A group of Microsoft workers in 2019 petitioned the company to cancel its initial Army deal, arguing it would turn real-world battlefields into a video game. Microsoft is among several tech companies that have sought to wow the gaming world with glitzy new virtual reality goggles over the past decade, though the efforts have largely fizzled. Microsoft pivoted away from consumer applications for its second-generation HoloLens 2, introduced in 2019, which is the basis for the Army's new gadgets. Although Microsoft recently demonstrated a way to use the goggles to play the hit game Pokemon Go, it mostly pitches the devices as work tools to help surgeons, factory crews and others. Users can often control what's on their screens using hand gestures or voice commands. The headset deal is part of Microsoft's broader work as a defense contractor. The Pentagon in September reaffirmed Microsoft as winner of a cloud computing contract potentially worth $10 billion, although the work has been delayed by a legal battle over rival Amazon’s claim that the bidding process was flawed.",0
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/eager-build-infrastructure-biden-plans-tax-business-76784907,business,"PITTSBURGH -- President   outlined a huge $2.3 trillion plan Wednesday to reengineer the nation’s infrastructure in what he billed as “a once-in-a-generation investment in America” that would undo his predecessor’s signature legislative achievement — giant tax cuts for corporations — in the process. Speaking at a carpenters union training center in Pittsburgh, Biden drew comparisons between his hard-hatted proposed transformation of the U.S. economy and the space race — and promised results as grand in scale as the New Deal or Great Society programs that shaped the 20th century. “It’s not a plan that tinkers around the edges,"" Biden said. ""It’s a once-in-a-generation investment in America unlike anything we’ve seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago. In fact, it’s the largest American jobs investment since World War II. It will create millions of jobs, good-paying jobs.” White House officials say the spending would generate those jobs as the country shifts away from fossil fuels and combats the perils of climate change. It is also an effort to compete with the technology and public investments made by China, which has the world’s second-largest economy and is fast gaining on the United States’ dominant position. “I’m convinced that if we act now, in 50 years people are going to look back and say this is the moment when America won the future,” Biden said. The Democratic president’s infrastructure projects would be financed by higher corporate taxes — a trade-off that could lead to         fierce resistance from the business community and thwart attempts to work with Republican lawmakers. Biden hopes to pass         an infrastructure plan by summer, which could mean relying solely on the slim Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate. The higher corporate taxes would aim to raise the necessary piles of money over 15 years and then reduce the deficit going forward. In doing so, Biden would undo the 2017 tax overhaul by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans and lift the corporate tax rate to 28% from the 21% rate. “Ninety-one Fortune 500 Companies, including Amazon, pay not a single solitary penny in income tax,” Biden said. Wednesday's announcement will be followed in coming weeks by Biden pushing a companion bill of roughly equal size for investments in child care, family tax credits and other domestic programs. That nearly $2 trillion package would be paid for by tax hikes on wealthy individuals and families. “Wall Street didn’t build this country,"" Biden said. ""You, the great middle class, built this country. And unions built the middle class.” Biden's choice of Pittsburgh for unveiling the plan carried important economic and political resonance. He not only won Pittsburgh and its surrounding county to help secure the presidency, but he launched his campaign there in 2019. The city famed for steel mills that powered America’s industrial rise has steadily pivoted toward technology and health care, drawing in college graduates in a sign of how economies can change. The White House says the largest chunk of the proposal         includes $621 billion for roads, bridges, public transit, electric vehicle charging stations and other transportation infrastructure. The spending would push the country away from internal combustion engines that the auto industry views as increasingly antiquated technology. An additional $111 billion would go to replace lead water pipes and upgrade sewers. Broadband internet would blanket the country for $100 billion. Separately, $100 billion would upgrade the power grid to deliver clean electricity. Homes would get retrofitted, schools modernized, workers trained and hospitals renovated under the plan, which also seeks to strengthen U.S. manufacturing. The new construction could keep the economy running hot, coming on the heels of         Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.  Economists already estimate it could push growth above 6% this year. To keep companies from shifting profits overseas to avoid taxation, a 21% global minimum tax would be imposed. The tax code would also be updated so that companies could not merge with foreign businesses and avoid taxes by moving their headquarters to a tax haven. And among other provisions, it would increase IRS audits of corporations. Biden appealed for Republicans and the business community to join him in negotiations on the bill, but the legislative prospects for Biden's twin proposals already appear to hinge on Democrats coming up with the votes on their own through the budget reconciliation process, which requires just a simple majority in the 50-50 Senate. “I’m going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office, listen to them, what they have to say and be open to other ideas,"" Biden said. ""We’ll have a good faith negotiation. Any Republican who wants to help get this done. But we have to get it done.” Democratic leaders embraced Biden’s plan Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said it would create millions of jobs. “I look forward to working with President Biden to pass a big, bold plan that will drive America forward for decades to come,” Schumer said at an event in Buffalo. But Republican opposition to Biden’s ambitious proposal came swiftly, and with resolve for the long brawl ahead. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell dismissed the package as nothing more than a “Trojan horse” for tax hikes. Republicans on Capitol Hill view the fight as a defining moment for the parties, framing it as a choice between Democrats intent on relying on government to solve the nation’s problems and a GOP that believes the private sector can best unleash the nation’s potential. Smarting over Biden’s intent to undo the 2017 tax cuts has only solidified what could amount to a wall of GOP opposition. The business community favors updating U.S. infrastructure but dislikes higher tax rates. U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley said in a statement that “we applaud the Biden administration for making infrastructure a top priority. However, we believe the proposal is dangerously misguided when it comes to how to pay for infrastructure.” The Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs, would rather have infrastructure funded with user fees such as tolls. Trump, in a statement, blasted his successor’s proposal, claiming it “would be among the largest self-inflicted economic wounds in history.” Infrastructure spending usually holds the promise of juicing economic growth, but by how much remains a subject of political debate. Commutes and shipping times could be shortened, while public health would be improved and construction jobs would bolster consumer spending. Standard & Poor’s chief U.S. economist, Beth Ann Bovino, estimated last year that a $2.1 trillion boost in infrastructure spending could add as much as $5.7 trillion in income to the entire economy over a decade. Those kinds of analyses have led liberal Democrats in Congress such as Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal to conclude, “The economic consensus is that infrastructure pays for itself over time.” But the Biden administration is taking a more cautious approach than some Democrats might like. After $1.9 trillion in pandemic aid and $4 trillion in relief last year, the administration is trying to avoid raising the national debt to levels that would trigger higher interest rates and make it harder to repay. Biden’s efforts may also be complicated by demands from a handful of Democratic lawmakers who say they cannot support the bill unless it addresses the $10,000 cap on individuals' state and local tax deductions put in place under Trump and a Republican-led Congress. With a narrow majority in the House, those Democrats could conceivably quash any bill that doesn’t significantly lift the cap or repeal it entirely. ——— Miller and Freking reported from Washington.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/bank-japan-survey-optimism-economic-recovery-76802155,business,"TOKYO -- A closely watched economic survey by the Bank of   shows growing optimism as the world’s third-largest economy grapples with the damage from the   pandemic. The quarterly “tankan” survey’s headline index for big manufacturers’ sentiment stood at plus 5 in March, a considerable improvement over the minus 10 marked in December, and more positive than the forecast at plus 4. The survey reported Thursday highlights a steady recovery in sentiment over the last three quarters, to levels before COVID-19 began in late 2019. The tankan measures corporate sentiment by subtracting the number of companies saying business conditions are negative from those responding they are positive. Sentiment among large nonmanufacturers improved by four points to minus 1, underlying how that sector is bouncing back far more slowly than big manufacturers. Naoya Oshikubo, senior economist at SuMi TRUST, or Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management, said he believes the recovery is slower in the service sector because of government-backed “states of emergency” issued periodically, with the latest ending in March. Exports have led the recovery, while the food, travel and accommodation sectors have stalled. But the overall impact will be gentler than last years’ because the latest emergency only applied to some parts of  , Oshikubo said in a report this week. “And, in general, people have become accustomed to COVID-19 measures,” he said. The coronavirus sent sentiment in Japan Inc. plunging last year to levels last seen when the economy was battered by the financial crisis more than a decade ago. Although trade and some economic activity have been recovering, income from tourism, a major driver for growth in recent years, is still squelched because of pandemic-related restrictions. Some 9,100 people have died from COVID-19 in Japan. The vaccine rollout has barely begun, with less than 1% of the population inoculated. Junichi Makino, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, noted the vaccine is key to ensuring a recovery in the nonmanufacturing sector, while profitability at major companies was likely to keep improving. “Consumer spending is critical for boosting domestic demand, and that's closely related to containing the coronavirus and progress of the vaccine rollout,” he said in comments on the tankan. With cases rising recently in a “fourth wave,”         worries are growing about the Tokyo Olympics, set to open in July, with tens of thousands of people, including athletes, business and government officials and media, entering the country from abroad. ——— Yuri Kageyama on Twitter         https://twitter.com/yurikageyama",4

Market benchmarks in Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney advanced. Japan's closely watched quarterly Tankan survey found business conditions improved more than expected. South Korea reported higher March export growth. House prices rose in New Zealand and Australian manufacturing expanded. “Asia-Pacific released a lot of data today, including Japan’s latest Tankan survey. Most of it was positive,” Robert Carnell of ING said in a report. Biden announced plans to spend on broadband internet and clean energy, roads, bridges and public transit. The plan would roll back corporate tax cuts enacted under his predecessor,  .

The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.3% to 3,453.10 and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo advanced 1.1% to 29,513.59. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.8% to 28,616.61. The Kospi in Seoul was 0.5% higher at 3,075.97 while Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.3% to 6,814.20. New Zealand and Jakarta declined while Singapore advanced. Investors are swinging between optimism that coronavirus vaccines will allow business to return to normal and unease about rising infections in the United States and some European countries. That has prompted some to reimpose travel curbs. In Japan, the Tankan index of business conditions for large manufacturers rose into positive territory for the first time since 2019.

South Korea reported March export growth accelerated to 16.6% over a year earlier from the previous month’s 9.5%. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index rose 0.4% on Wednesday to 3,972.89. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.3% to 32,981.55. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.5%, to 13,246.87. Technology stocks powered much of S&P 500's latest gains, even though more stocks in the index fell than rose. Apple, Microsoft and chipmaker Nvidia rose while financial, energy and materials stocks declined. The 10-year Treasury yield inched up to 1.74%, close to its highest level since before the pandemic rocked markets a year ago. Vaccinations and government spending plans have raised expectations for supercharged economic growth and a possible rise in inflation, which has pushed yields higher.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/pressure-ga-corporate-leaders-slam-voting-bill-76796793,business,"ATLANTA -- Some of Georgia's most prominent corporate leaders on Wednesday began to more forcefully criticize the state's         sweeping new election law, acknowledging         concerns of civil rights activists and Black business executives who say the measure targets non-white voters and threatens the democratic process. The chief executives of         Delta Air Lines and         Coca-Cola pivoted from earlier, more equivocal statements and called the law “unacceptable,"" opening an unusual rift with Republican leaders who championed the legislation and typically enjoy a cozy relationship with the state's business community. The business lobby in Georgia, home to 18 Fortune 500 companies, wields significant clout in state politics. Civil rights activists blamed influential executives for not helping spike the new law that's become a focal point in the nationwide, partisan fight over voting rights, and there is rising pressure nationally on corporate titans to defend voting rights more explicitly and oppose Republican efforts in states that could follow Georgia’s lead. Delta's and Coca-Cola's latest declarations could push Georgia's other marquee brands, including UPS and Home Depot, to take a stronger stand. “Delta’s statement finally tells the truth — even if it’s late,” said Nsé Ufot of the New Georgia Project, which has launched an ad campaign targeting major corporations. After Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed the new law last week, Delta issued a statement promoting parts of the law such as expanded weekend voting, but said “we understand concerns remain over other provisions ... and there continues to be work ahead in this important effort.” Chief executive Ed Bastian was more blunt in a memo sent Wednesday to employees. “The entire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections. This is simply not true,” Bastian wrote, alluding to former President Donald Trump’s false claims that he lost because of fraud. “Unfortunately, that excuse is being used in states across the nation that are attempting to pass similar legislation to restrict voting rights.” Bastian said Delta “joined other major Atlanta corporations to work closely with elected officials from both parties, to try and remove some of the most egregious measures from the bill. We had some success in eliminating the most suppressive tactics that some had proposed.” But, he said, “I need to make it crystal clear that the final bill is unacceptable and does not match Delta’s values.” Speaking later on CNBC, Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey called the legislation a “step backward.” “It does not promote principles we have stood for in Georgia around broad access to voting, around voter convenience, about ensuring election integrity,” he said. ""This legislation is wrong and needs to be remedied.” Kemp insisted the law was being misrepresented. He accused businesses of ignoring their role in its development. “Throughout the legislative process, we spoke directly with Delta representatives numerous times,” the governor said in a statement. “Today’s statement ... stands in stark contrast to our conversations with the company, ignores the content of the new law, and unfortunately continues to spread the same false attacks being repeated by partisan activists.” The reaction wasn’t much friendlier from voting rights groups that fought the legislation and criticized corporate players for not trying to block it altogether. Ufot chided Bastian for his timing and alluding to conversations “with leaders and employees in the Black community” late in the process. She also noted advocates' pending demands that Delta and other companies no longer use their political action committees to back lawmakers who support voting restrictions. Bastian’s memo did not address that matter. Quincey noted on CNBC that Coca-Cola, even before Georgia's action, already had paused its PAC activity and would consider politicians' position on voting rights as part of future contributions. Separately Wednesday, dozens of Black business executives from around the country, including Merck chief executive Kenneth Frazier and former American Express chief executive Kenneth Chenault, released a joint letter in The New York Times urging corporate America to stand up forcefully on matters of racial justice. Black activists, meanwhile, recall that many U.S. corporations took public stands last summer amid nationwide demonstrations against systemic racism and police violence. Bishop Reginald Jackson, who presides over more than 400 African Methodist Episcopal churches in Georgia, said too many corporate leaders have been “silent” on voting laws. He has called for his 90,000 parishioners to boycott Delta, Coca-Cola and other major brands. “This is not just a Georgia issue or problem. It is a national problem that we believe puts our democracy at risk,” Jackson said. Business analysts say the dynamics are challenging for corporations. “Delta clearly felt a lot of heat for its previous statement. Delta’s problem now is credibility,” said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst in San Francisco. “Will people believe future Delta statements or actions regarding voting rights or social justice?” Kemp signed the measure last Thursday, hours after a negotiated version cleared the state House and Senate in whirlwind votes. It is part of a tide of GOP-sponsored election bills introduced in states across the country after Trump’s false assertions about the 2020 elections. Democrat Joe Biden won the presidential race in Georgia by about 12,000 votes out of almost 5 million cast, and Democrats won two Jan. 5 Senate runoffs to give the party control of the chamber on Capitol Hill. Georgia officials, including Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, also a Republican, vouched for election’s accuracy even as they backed some changes that could make it harder for Georgians to cast absentee ballots, a method that more than one-fifth of the November electorate used. The new law adds a photo ID requirement for voting absentee by mail, cuts the amount of time people have to request an absentee ballot and limits where drop boxes can be placed and when they can be accessed. It also bans people from handing out food or water to voters waiting in line and allows the Republican-controlled State Election Board to remove and replace county election officials while curtailing the power of the secretary of state as Georgia’s chief elections officer. Republicans insist the changes are needed to restore voters’ confidence. Civil rights groups have filed federal lawsuits seeking to overturn the Georgia law. They've otherwise turned their focus to Washington, where Democrats are pushing         a comprehensive federal overhaul of election law that could effectively override many changes being enacted in Georgia and considered elsewhere. Advocates want corporate leaders like Bastian and Quincey to help. “They’ve been out there trying to claim victory in Georgia, saying basically that this bill could have been worse,” said Mia Arreguin of Progress Georgia. “But this was never going to be a voter-friendly bill. Now they can really do something about it” in Washington. “We aren’t watching what they say. We are watching what they do.” Bastian nodded toward Capitol Hill action in his memo, declaring that federal proposals would “expand voting rights nationwide.” He noted one bill is “named after the late Atlanta civil rights hero and Delta friend John Lewis,” the longtime Georgia congressman who died last year. But Bastian stopped short of an explicit position. Delta, he wrote, is “closely monitoring legislation.”",3
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/analysis-bumpy-road-ahead-bidens-infrastructure-plan-76797885,business,"Infrastructure was a road to nowhere for former presidents   and  . But   believes he can use it to drive America to the future after a dozen years of false starts. The trip is unlikely to be smooth. Biden's         $2.3 trillion infrastructure package, released Wednesday, would go well beyond the usual commitments to roads and bridges to touch almost every part of the country. It's a down payment on combating climate change, a chance to take on racial inequities, an expansion of broadband, an investment in manufacturing and a reorienting of corporate   to pay for everything. To succeed where his predecessors stalled, Biden will have to navigate a conflicting set of political forces with winners and losers all around. “It’s big, yes, it’s bold, yes, and we can get it done,"" the president said in a Wednesday afternoon speech in Pittsburgh. “In 50 years, people are gonna look back and say, this was the moment that America won the future.” Biden sees infrastructure as a fundamental promise that must be honored before Democrats face voters in 2022. The president resisted calls by business groups to pay for his plan with higher gas   and tolls, since the costs would be borne by working Americans and Biden had promised no tax hikes on anyone making less than $400,000. That's according to an administration official who insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations. Yet the decision to keep that particular promise likely dooms any chance of wider bipartisan unity. Biden's proposal would gut the core of Trump's 2017 tax cuts — an affront to many Republican lawmakers, who would also prefer that infrastructure stay in a narrow lane. The corporate tax rate would jump to 28% from 21% under Biden's plan, and a global minimum tax would be charged to prevent companies from avoiding taxes. Even before Biden delivered his opening speech on the plan, Republicans had latched on to Reagan-era labeling, dismissing the package as tax-and-spend liberalism. That's an attack designed to erode public support as different components of the package get divvied up among congressional committees and begin their journey through Congress. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called the plan a “Trojan horse” for tax hikes. Trump issued a statement saying the big winner would be China because U.S. jobs would move overseas due to higher taxes. “It is the exact OPPOSITE of putting America First—it is putting America LAST!” said Trump, whose own repeated attempts at an “infrastructure week” failed to capture political momentum and became something of a punchline. Some Democratic lawmakers, on the other hand, fear Biden's plan does too little over eight years. Others see it as a chance to tinker by repealing the $10,000 taxpayer limit on deducting state and local taxes, or SALT, that was instituted under Trump. Each possible Democratic defection matters because vacant seats leave House Democrats with the thinnest of majorities. And in the evenly split Senate, Democrats must rely on Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote for their edge. “I can only vote for a bill that has meaningful tax impact for my constituents if it addresses the SALT cap,” tweeted Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., one of four lawmakers demanding to expand deductions. Some environmentalists, meanwhile, say the plan doesn't do enough to stop the tides of climate change, even with its proposed upgrades to the power grid and plans to build 500,000 electric-vehicle charging stations. They could push Biden to go even bigger, though he plans to announce a second package in the coming weeks focused on child care, family tax credits and other domestic programs, paid for by tax hikes on wealthy individuals and families. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chair of the near-100-member Congressional Progressive Caucus, said climate change demands that Biden commit to more money. “It makes little sense to narrow his previous ambition on infrastructure or compromise with the physical realities of climate change,” she said. Almost every trade group in Washington representing interests from semiconductors to steel has a stake in the infrastructure bill, as does organized labor, which sees the potential for union jobs. Business groups have long backed bold investment in infrastructure — just not through taxes on their members. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable both strongly oppose the tax hikes. White House officials welcome the coming debate as a way to press their case, using the same kind of strategy that Biden deployed with his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief that became law in March. If tax hikes are opposed, how should the infrastructure be financed? What are lawmakers' counteroffers? The difference in this proposal, compared to coronavirus relief, is that infrastructure is not an emergency that can be funded through debt with minimal tradeoffs. Instead, congressional committees can break up its details and consider each of them separately, possibly peeling off elements like highway or water infrastructure that have some bipartisan support. In fact, past failures mean that many of the ideas being proposed have circulated among lawmakers for decades. But failure by political leaders this time could be devastating for America's economic trajectory. Once the economy bounces back from the pandemic, economists expect growth to fade below the relatively sluggish levels of the Obama and Trump eras. Infrastructure is a central way to increase worker productivity, the ultimate source of wealth and productivity. “It’s the first time that I see a comprehensive plan that truly can have a fundamental change in American productivity,” said Sadek Wahba, founder of the infrastructure investment firm I Squared Capital. “This is really the moment. If we’re not able to do it now, I would be very, very pessimistic about our ability to maintain our productivity over the coming decade.” ——— EDITOR’S NOTE: Josh Boak has covered the U.S. economy and the White House for The Associated Press for seven years. ——— Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro and Kevin Freking contributed to this analysis.",6
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/company-heart-jj-vaccine-woes-series-citations-76803905,business,"The company at the center of quality problems that led Johnson & Johnson to discard an unknown amount of its coronavirus vaccine has a string of citations from U.S. health officials for quality control problems. Emergent BioSolutons, a little-known company at the center of the vaccine supply chain, was a key to Johnson & Johnson's plan to deliver 100 million doses of its vaccine to the U.S. by the end of May. But the company has been cited repeatedly by the Food and Drug Administration for problems such as poorly trained employees, cracked vials and mold around one of its facilities, according to records obtained by The Associated Press through the Freedom of Information Act. The records cover inspections at Emergent facilities since 2017. Johnson & Johnson said Wednesday that a batch of vaccine made by Emergent at its Baltimore factory, known as Bayview, can't be used because it didn't meet quality standards. It wasn't clear exactly how many doses were involved or how the problem would affect future delivers of J&J's vaccine. The company said in a statement it was still planning to deliver 100 million doses by the end of June and was “aiming to deliver those doses by the end of May.” J&J locked arms with Emergent in April 2020, enlisting the lesser-known company to manufacture the vaccine J&J was developing with federal funding. At the time, Emergent’s Bayview facility wasn’t scaled for making millions of doses of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, according to the FDA records that describe the plant as a contract testing laboratory that “did not manufacture products for distribution.” Upgrades in technology and personnel were required before Bayview could begin making what’s known as “drug substance” material for the vaccine, a two-month process during which the required biological cells are grown. The FDA inspected Emergent’s Bayview plant in April 2020, just as the agreement with J&J was being announced. The federal agency criticized the company for problems with its testing of a potential treatment for anthrax, according to the records obtained by the AP. The FDA’s lead investigator cited the company for failing to train employees “in the particular operations they perform as part of their function and current good manufacturing practices.” On the same day, Johnson & Johnson, in a separate news release, heralded its partnership with Emergent as a step toward the pharmaceutical giant’s goal of supplying more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine globally by the end of 2021. Other problems cited by the FDA during the April 2020 inspection included failures by the Bayview plant “to ensure that electronically held data generated during analytical testing” of material “was protected from deletion or manipulation.” The FDA’s lead investigator, Marcellinus Dordunoo, wrote that Emergent hadn’t investigated what he described as “data integrity concerns.” The inspection was the most recent in a series of critical reports from the FDA about Emergent, including one following a December 2017 inspection at a plant in Canton, Massachusetts, in which the FDA said the company hadn’t corrected “continued low level mold and yeast isolates” found in the facility. Nearly a year later, agency investigators questioned why Emergent had “an unwritten policy of not conducting routine compliance audits” at a separate plant in Baltimore, known as Camden, where an anthrax vaccine is filled into vials. Emergent’s revenues skyrocketed during the Trump administration, jumping from around $523 million in 2015 to more than $1.5 billion in 2020. The company has invested heavily in lobbying the federal government, according to disclosure records, which show the company spent $3.6 million on lobbying in 2020 alone. Emergent is one of about 10 companies that Johnson & Johnson is using to speed up manufacturing of its recently approved vaccine, the company said. The Bayview factory where the tainted vaccine ingredient was found had not yet been approved by the FDA, so no vaccine in circulation is affected. Emergent declined to comment. President Joe Biden has pledged to have enough vaccines for all U.S. adults by the end of May. The U.S. government has ordered enough two-dose shots from Pfizer and Moderna to vaccinate 200 million people to be delivered by late May, plus the 100 million single-dose shots from J&J. A federal official said Wednesday evening the administration’s goal can be met without additional J&J doses. A J&J spokesman said earlier Wednesday that the company met the end-of-March goal, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s online vaccine tracker showed J&J had provided about 6.8 million doses to the U.S. vaccine effort. J&J has been shipping finished vaccines from its factory in the Netherlands to the U.S. J&J said it was putting more of its manufacturing and quality experts inside Emergent’s factory to supervise production of the COVID-19 vaccine, a move meant to enable delivery of an additional 24 million vaccine doses through April. J&J said it still expects to deliver more than 1 billion vaccine doses globally by the end of the year. The J&J vaccine has been viewed as crucial for vaccination campaigns around the world, because only one shot is required and it can be shipped and stored at standard refrigeration temperatures, unlike some other vials that must be kept frozen. The company also has pledged to sell the vaccine without a profit, but only during the pandemic emergency. The problem with the vaccine batch was first reported by The New York Times. The FDA said it was aware of the situation but declined further comment. ——— Johnson reported from Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania, and Lardner from Washington.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/bends-blockbuster-popular-netflix-show-76774655,business,"BEND, Ore. -- The Blockbuster video rental store in Bend, Oregon, soared to international fame when it became the last such franchise on Earth two years ago. Now, a new Netflix documentary called “The Last Blockbuster” brought even more interest in the form of visitors, mail and online orders to the unassuming location in a central Oregon strip mall 170 miles east of Portland. Since the documentary aired March 15, people from all over the world have sent flowers and called the store just to say “thank you” for staying open. In the backroom, staff members have been busy packaging thousands of online orders for Blockbuster T-shirts, hats and face masks, which are all made by Bend businesses. The movie focuses on the manager’s day-to-day work running the store,         which became the last in the world when the Blockbuster in Perth, Australia, closed two years ago. It was made by two local filmmakers who saw history and nostalgia in the store's perseverance. “It’s a little bit crazy, but it’s a very good thing,” store manager Sandi Harding         told The Bulletin in Bend. “We’ll take a little crazy if it means keeping the store open.” Harding is the star of the movie, which peaked as high as the No. 4 movie in the United States since it appeared on Netflix March 15. The Blockbuster video rental store in Bend was already popular when it became the last location on Earth. It drew visitors from across the United States and as far as Taiwan and London. “It’s good for the store. It’s good for the community,” said Harding, who has been stopped in the grocery store by fans who want to take her picture. “And I can learn to live with my newfound fame as long as it doesn’t mess with what we are doing every day.” The two Bend filmmakers behind the documentary, Taylor Morden and Zeke Kamm, had no idea if the store would stay open when they started filming in 2017. Morden said he has heard from people who call Harding a national treasure and say the store must remain open at all costs. He is pleased to know the film’s attention on Netflix may be what keeps the store open. “For us to have some small part in helping the store stay open is amazing,” Morden said. “Not a lot of documentaries actually accomplish the goal of their story.” The Bend Blockbuster has no plans to close. It has a steady lease agreement, and the local owners, Ken and Debbie Tisher, have leased the property since 1992, when it was a Pacific Video store. The store was franchised in 2000 and became a Blockbuster. In its heyday, Blockbuster Video had 9,000 stores around the world. But in-store video rental stores began struggling with the rise in on-demand streaming services such as Netflix — the very streaming service now offering the Blockbuster documentary. In 2010, Blockbuster declared bankruptcy, and by 2014, all corporate-owned stores had shuttered. That left locally owned franchises like the one in Bend to fend for themselves, and one by one, they closed. When stores in Anchorage and Fairbanks, Alaska, shut down in 2018 — barely outlasting a Redmond, Oregon, store — Bend’s Blockbuster was the only U.S. location left. Then, in 2019, the only other Blockbuster in Perth, Australia, shut its doors, leaving Bend as the last store. The movie also reveals that Blockbuster had an option to buy Netflix years ago, when the company was still a mail-order DVD service and hadn't transformed into the dominant streaming service it is now. The video empire's leadership, however, saw Netflix as a niche market with limited potential and declined to buy it, according to the documentary and previous news reports. But beyond the business details, the movie taps into the nostalgia felt by people of a certain age as the world speeds up and personal interactions become less frequent, the filmmakers said. Many watching it recall working in Blockbuster stores themselves or renting from them often in their younger years. “It’s affected people emotionally,” Kamm said. “I think it reminded people that we had this thing that was such an important part of our lives. Hopefully it reminds people to appreciate the things they have now.” Both filmmakers feel connected with the Bend Blockbuster, even though they are done filming their movie. They contact Harding regularly to find out if she needs more DVDs of their movies or movie posters to sell at the store. “I’m sure I’ll be involved with the folks at the last Blockbuster until they ever close,” Morden said. “There is no way we are not going to be connected.”",0
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/chinas-huawei-2020-sales-rose-us-sanctions-76784413,business,"BEIJING -- Chinese tech giant Huawei said Wednesday it eked out higher sales and profit last year but growth plunged after its smartphone unit was hammered by U.S. sanctions imposed in a fight with Beijing over technology and security. China’s first global tech brand reported sales of phones, network gear and other technology rose 3.8% over 2019 to 891.4 billion yuan ($135.8 billion), a decline from the previous year’s 19.1% growth. That was propelled by a 15.4% gain in China, while sales in other markets shrank. Huawei Technologies Ltd. is struggling to keep its global markets after then-President   in 2019 cut off access to U.S. processor chips and other technology. Huawei was the top-selling smartphone brand in the second quarter of 2020 but fell out of the global top five after losing Google's music and other popular services. “We think this is a very unfair situation to Huawei. It has damaged us a lot,” chairman Ken Hu said at a news conference at Huawei headquarters in the southern city of Shenzhen. The results reflect the damage from sanctions and point to a possible future for Huawei that focuses on China and on networks and other products that are less vulnerable to foreign pressure. Huawei, which denies accusations it might aid Chinese spying, sold its lower-priced Honor smartphone brand in hopes of reviving sales by separating it from the sanctions on the parent company. Huawei says it has a stockpile of U.S. chips for its high-end smartphones but executives have said those are running out. Trump expanded sanctions by barring global suppliers last year from using U.S. technology to produce chips for Huawei. Economists and political analysts expect little change under President Joe Biden, who succeeded Trump in January. The founder of Huawei, Ren Zhengfei, said in February he sees little chance that sanctions will be lifted. Hu didn’t respond directly when asked how Huawei would cope if sanctions remain and when China’s fledgling tech industry might supply the advanced chips it needs. But he said U.S. suppliers have lost $10-20 billion in annual sales to Huawei and expressed hope for unspecified “help from national leaders around the world” to restore interaction with global chip suppliers. “We hope they can help us to restore this kind of cooperation in the semiconductor industry,” he said. Hu expressed confidence global sales will rebound once the coronavirus pandemic is brought under control. “I’m pretty positive about 2021 performance in regions outside China, but I’m not able to give you a definitive forecast,"" he said. The clash with Washington prompted the ruling Communist Party to make transforming China into a self-reliant “technology power” this year's top economic priority. The Finance Ministry announced this week chipmakers will be exempt from import taxes on equipment and raw materials through 2030. Huawei said 2020 profit edged up 3.2% to 64.6 billion yuan ($9.8 billion), decelerating from 2019’s 5.6% growth. Sales growth was the weakest since a one-year contraction in the early 2000s after the tech industry was shaken by the collapse of share prices for internet companies on Wall Street, according to the company. Sales of smartphones and other consumer products rose 3.3% over 2019 to 487 billion yuan ($74.1 billion), or 54% of total revenue. That was down from a 34% increase in 2019. In a show of technical prowess, the company unveiled a folding smartphone in February with an eight-inch-wide (20-centimeter-wide) screen. But it said the Mate X2 will be sold only in China, possibly reflecting shortages of processor chips to manufacture it. Research and development spending, already among the highest for any company, rose to 141.9 billion yuan ($21.6 billion), according to Huawei. That was 16% of revenue, up from about 10% in previous years. Sales in 2020 were hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. The 15.4% sales growth was less than half of 2019’s 36.2%. Network equipment sales to global phone carriers were flat at 302.6 billion yuan ($46.4 billion) after Washington pressured European and other allies to exclude Huawei as they upgrade to next-generation technology. Chinese officials accuse Washington of using phony security accusations to hurt a rising competitor. The two governments, along with Canada, are fighting over the arrest in Vancouver of a Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, who is Ren’s daughter. She is fighting extradition to the United States on charges related to possible violation of U.S. trade sanctions on Iran. Two former Canadian diplomats were arrested in China and are being prosecuted on spying charges in what is widely seen as an attempt to pressure Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to release Meng. As more people worked remotely, technology sales to manufacturers, health care and other businesses jumped 23% in 2020 to 103.4 billion yuan ($15.4 billion), up from 2019’s 8.6% gain. Huawei says it is owned by the Chinese employees who make up half its workforce of 197,000 in 170 countries. The company began reporting financial results a decade ago in an attempt to defuse Western security concerns. ——— Huawei Technologies Ltd.: www.huawei.com",4
https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/dubai-art-shows-return-reflects-citys-normal-76805714,business,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- It was a scene reminiscent of pre-pandemic Dubai: Art lovers dressed in designer clothes or alternative fashion, walking around in one of the city's many swanky locations. Bloggers, VIPs and influencers filming on their mobile phones. People mingling and laughing. The only difference? They all wore masks. After being canceled in March last year due to the coronavirus pandemic, Art Dubai returned this week to the sunbaked desert metropolis it calls home, becoming one of the first in-person international art fairs of 2021. The show is part of the city-state's efforts to reopen to international trade and tourism that power its economy. “Art Dubai was the first art fair to be canceled, just when the pandemic started"" and now it's the first to be back live, said Pablo del Val, the show's artistic director. “I think it’s been an emotional, fantastic moment,"" he added. “I think everyone was looking forward to stop looking to screens and having a physical relationship with a work of art.” This year's installment is different, however. Typically held at the vast conference space of Madinat Jumeirah in the shadow of Dubai's iconic, sail-shaped Burj al-Arab hotel, the 2021 event instead came to Dubai International Financial Center. Temporary galleries sprung up around the center's Gate House, the landmark structure at the business hub. Signs of the pandemic are still everywhere: Social-distancing signs and hand sanitizer dispensers stand visible in the tents housing the galleries. People attending the fair can book a specific time slot in advance to guarantee their entry. Those worried about being around a crowd can take a virtual tour of the fair from home. Even some of the art is teleconferencing into the event. Art Dubai introduced a program allowing galleries unable to travel to Dubai to connect to visitors via video. The fair features 50 contemporary and modern galleries from 31 countries, specializing in regions that are not main players on the international art scene. It also focuses on artists from the Middle East. One of them is Rashed al-Shashai, a prominent figure of the contemporary Saudi art scene. He recently designed a piece entitled Concise Passage, 2020 in the kingdom's al-Ula historical district — a feature made of shipping crates divided by a pink-lighted walkway symbolizing a region that was once a key stop on an incense trade route linking Arabia to Asia. “Taking part in this fair shows the determination of art to be part of bringing life back to normal, for people and humanity,"" al-Shashai said. ""It helps people live in a better way, even when there are disasters and tragedies happening in the world.” As Dubai went into a lockdown in early 2020, the city's big events shut down, along with its long-haul carrier Emirates.         The autocratically ruled emirate moved aggressively to reopen in July to tourists. Coronavirus numbers however         spiked to levels unseen following New Year's Eve.  Other countries also blamed         Dubai for outbreaks of coronavirus variants. Since then, reported daily new infection numbers have dropped to over 2,000, from highs of nearly 4,000 at the worst of the winter. The United Arab Emirates is vaccinating at one of the quickest rates in the world, hoping to be ready for         Dubai hosting its Expo 2020 world's fair in October, after the pandemic forced a delay of the event last year. With airlines flying again, big events back on the calendar, and bars and restaurants open to residents and tourists — albeit masked when not eating or drinking — the UAE hopes to power through the rest of the pandemic. “Corona changed life as a whole,"" al-Shashai said. “I found that people are just waiting for a chance to come back, and they will, and they will rebuild, and they will forget everything that happened, and it will all become tales to be told.” The pandemic also featured in the art exhibited in the show. One piece, a giant outdoor display reading “NEWS: IT WON'T BE LIKE THIS FOREVER” drew many a selfie. “I think that culture is something that should never be canceled and I think it doesn’t matter the times that you’re going through,"" del Val said. “I think it’s a way that we can really interrelate with each other and where our senses and our positiveness come back to life."" “I think that one of the magics that Art Dubai is managing this week is precisely that ... bringing people (into) a completely different state of mind,” he added.

He was 58. The former prime minister's family and his governing Socialist party said Fino died Monday in a hospital, where he had been treated for several days after contracting COVID-19. The government declared Monday a day of national mourning, with flags flying at half-staff. Fino was a trained economist and former mayor of Gjirokastra, 230 kilometers (140 miles) south of the capital, Tirana. He was appointed in 1997 by Albania's president to lead a government of national unity. The country was on the brink of total anarchy following the collapse of widespread and wildly popular pyramid investment schemes, in which very many Albanians lost their life savings. Fino served for five months until early  s were held which brought the Socialists to power. He was credited with restoring normality in a country where central and local government structures had collapsed in the face of the protests, during which civilians entered army depots and looted vast quantities of arms. About 3,000 people died in the ensuing violence. “Mr. Fino will be remembered for his leadership, at a very young age, of Albania’s National Reconciliation Government during the difficult year 1997, as well as for his contributions to the lawmaking process during his extensive political career,” the U.S. Embassy in Tirana said in a statement. Prime Minister Edi Rama, who heads the Socialists, said he was temporarily suspending his party’s campaign activities before a national   scheduled for April 25. Lulzim Basha, leader of the main opposition center-right Democratic Party, also canceled his daily electoral activities. Fino held several other government positions and was a serving lawmaker with the Socialists until his death. He is survived by his wife, a daughter and a son.",0

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/transgender-tech-visibility-obstacles-remain/story?id=76374628,business,"Ginger Chien said she was a ""techie"" from a young age. ""I was given all of the opportunities typically afforded to boys,"" she recalled. ""I was given freedom to be loud, and to attract attention. And given all of the technology toys as well -- Legos, Tinker toys, Erector sets."" Born in 1962 to Chinese immigrants, Chien's childhood seemed typical of a future engineer. She's been an engineer for decades, working as a device architect for   for the last 25 years. She's also part of the   working in the tech and engineering industries. Additionally, Chien is an advocate for trans rights. Exact statistics on trans people in tech are virtually nonexistent. Trans people face concerns over their safety, security and often, their very lives, by coming out. But there is a vibrant, engaged and increasingly vocal trans community made up of engineers, software developers, user interface designers and other tech professionals. Silicon Valley has focused on diversity and inclusion in recent years. There's an effort to get more women, people of color and LGBTQ+ people in tech and engineering. But as more trans people in tech come out in their workplaces, some say far more needs to be done to make them feel safe and supported at work. Chien said though she knew from an early age her choice of profession would be a technical one, she had questions ""very early"" surrounding her identity. ""I do recall that at a very early age I was asking for toys and friends and clothes ... to play with some of the girls in the neighborhood,"" she said. With those questions, came anxiety. As the only American-born son in her family, she said that in Chinese culture, ""there are certain expectations of sons."" ""I did not feel safe uncovering my gender identity. In fact, in early years it didn't even have a name. There was no way for me to even express the idea that I might want to be a girl because there were no words for it other than words that convey mental illness and illegal behavior,"" she said. That led to many years of living a ""submarined"" life, Chien said. She found success as an engineer, working right out of college for a defense contractor, but living an inauthentic life took a toll. ""I was afraid of losing the marriage that I had and the daughter that we had and my professional reputation once my career was established,"" she said. ""There was always something to worry about,"" Chien said. She said she became ""unhappy, sullen and unproductive"" at work. It took a long process of discovery and constantly weighing risks before Chien said she could embrace her identity as a woman. Also helping her, she said, was finding a new job with AT&T and discovering the company had a long-established LGBTQ employee resource group. In addition to the tech industry, finding accurate population totals on trans individuals overall in society is difficult. Violence and stigma against trans people make many of them wary about coming out in public. Adding to anti-trans sentiment, state legislators have filed a record number of bills this year that would impact the  , according to the Human Rights Campaign. The University of California, Los Angeles School of Law's Williams Institute, which studies sexual orientation, gender identity law and public policy   in the U.S. identify as transgender -- about 0.6% of the population. Workplace numbers are even scarcer but some tech companies, including   and   have publicly shared data on LGBTQ+ representation within their companies. And when Glassdoor -- an employment website -- posted the 24   for in 2020, 50% were tech companies, including Intuit, Uber, Google, IBM, Microsoft, PayPal, Accenture, HP, Salesforce, AT&T and Apple. Some of these companies are also on other LGBTQ-friendly work lists, including the  . And there are also growing numbers of organizations and online spaces for trans people in tech.    and   hold events and offer resources for trans, nonbinary and queer people in technology. Some trans and nonbinary people are also using their tech skills to make a career out of activism. Emma Best is a queer and nonbinary journalist, ""leakivist,"" publisher and sometimes analyst. As a ""leakivist,"" Best uses their tech prowess as a form of activism and has made leaked data accessible to media and other journalists. Best said anonymity makes it easier for trans people and gender nonconforming individuals to ""get their foot in the door"" in the tech space, especially with ""the prevalence of remote working."" But, Best said, more trans, queer and nonbinary people are also more active in tech because they are being more visible and ""refusing to yield their space."" Chien also offered reasons why more trans people may be more comfortable working in technology. ""Tech is a place where your performance is really easy to quantify,"" she said. ""I think it creates room for people who may be different in some way, but are also able to apply some of those arcane skills to ... tech."" ""I think that people in the tech industry tend to have sometimes more eclectic backgrounds ... there's a lot of different types of people coming together,"" Eli, 26, who asked their last name withheld for privacy reasons, told ABC News. Eli worked for several years in Apple retail. Despite greater visibility and more activism, everyday workplace resources for trans people are critical, said Max Masure, a trans nonbinary inclusion strategist. Masure worked for years as a user experience designer, but now consults with companies on how to foster inclusive environments for transgender people. ""I was born as a girl, and I lived my life as a woman for 36 years. And I only came out four years ago,"" Masure, who was born in France, told ABC News. ""I didn't see any trans people around me, the only ones were in the media ... mostly trans women, and they were made fun of,"" Masure said. It wasn't until Masure came to New York to work in tech that they said they had more visibility into queer and nonbinary people and culture. Masure became more empowered to embrace their authentic self, albeit with some consequences. ""I was working in tech at the time, and I had to advocate for myself, and I lost some clients being a freelancer,"" Masure said. That ""led me to realize there was a need for the tech community to train around inclusion. ... [The] usage of pronouns and putting them into our names in email signatures, on LinkedIn, is helping not only the trans community, but also everyone to be more inclusive,"" said Masure. For the last three years, Masure has switched from designing to training companies on trans and gender inclusion. The service is much-needed as even the most well-intentioned companies can make missteps. ""I recognized that I was trans a couple years into working for Apple. And then I came out while I was there and started to medically and socially transition,"" Eli said. While Eli said they didn't ""hide anything"" about their gender while working at Apple, they also said they didn't feel the need to explicitly disclose their identity. In fact, Eli wanted to take a more low-key approach in telling their co-workers how they identified and how they wanted to be addressed. ""I wanted to just come out through email,"" Eli said. Instead, Eli said they had to ""write up something that either I could tell people face to face ... individually or in a group. Or I was told the managers could do that. So it ended up being that one of the managers came out to people in small groups for me, which was not really my ideal way of doing it."" Situations like the one Eli described underscore the need for workplaces to do more to support trans people, advocates like Chien and Masure said. Supportive action could be as simple as asking employees to share their preferred pronouns. Eli said eventually employees started wearing nametags with their preferred pronouns at the Apple store where they worked. Even the way businesses handle internal forms can make a difference. Chien recalled her relief when she submitted a name-change form to AT&T's HR department. The form offered employees the option to select ""personal choice"" as a reason for a name change request -- meaning they did not have to disclose information they may feel uncomfortable sharing. For Chien, that option on the form meant a ""complete shift of agency of who has the right to decide my future and my identity."" Health care options to support trans people are also critical ways companies can help. ""Having health insurance that covers gender-affirming procedures is just something that is so hard to find,"" Eli said. For the trans community, insurance that covers ""big procedures, like bottom surgeries and top surgeries,"" is needed, Eli said. ""But ... there's other procedures, like facial surgeries, that are not covered as often that are very important ... in terms of safety out in public for people, especially trans feminine people and trans women,"" said Eli. For Masure, a key component for inclusion is active support from a business' leadership. ""What I see the most is the lack of leadership involvement,"" Masure said. ""I see people working in companies where they are not respected ... their pronouns are not respected ... jokes are made during regular meetings."" Masure said that leaders have to set examples by being examples of inclusivity. As trans people, ""we cannot only be the ones educating other people,"" Masure said. ""It gets exhausting."" Trans advocates urge cisgender people to go beyond being allies and become advocates. That could mean asking a company to create gender nonspecific bathrooms or speaking up when a trans person is misgendered or harassed in any way. ""The outside world can feel like a really dangerous place, especially today with anti-trans and anti-Asian"" violence and threats, Chien said, referring to the recent spate of  She said speaking out and advocating are important ways to create supportive workplaces for trans people. ""In the absence of language, there's an absence of possibility,"" Chien said.",0

The multimillion-dollar commitment comes as tech giants including Google have taken heat for their perceived role in the proliferation of misinformation on the internet. Matt Brittin, the president of Google in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, announced the €25 million (approximately $29.3 million) contribution to help launch the European Media and Information fund in a company blog post on Wednesday. The fund will support the European University Institute, the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and the European Digital Media Observatory, Brittin said. It will go toward the work of strengthening media literacy skills, supporting fact-checkers and further research into ways to fight misinformation online. In the coming weeks, the fund will open for grant proposals ""from academics, nonprofits and publishers,"" Brittin said. ""Independent committees made up of industry experts will select the winning ideas and Google won't be involved in any decision making related to the Fund,"" he added.

https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/mexico-legislature-oks-legal-recreational-marijuana-76803340,business,"SANTA FE, N.M -- New Mexico is joining a wave of states that are legalizing recreational   as its Democrat-dominated Legislature sent a package of cannabis bills Wednesday to a supportive governor. Lawmakers used a marathon two-day legislative session to push through   legalization for adults over 21 and a companion bill that automatically erases many past marijuana convictions, overriding skeptical Republicans. By signing the bills, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham would extend legal recreational pot sales in the American Southwest by April 2022, when the New Mexico legislation kicks in, and join 16 states that have legalized marijuana, mostly through direct ballot initiatives. California and Colorado were among the first in the U.S. to legalize marijuana,         with Arizona becoming one of the latest in the region to follow suit earlier this year. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a legalization bill Wednesday, and a proposal in Virginia is awaiting the governor’s signature. The New Mexico initiative would reconsider criminal drug sentences for about 100 prisoners, and give the governor a strong hand in licensing the industry and monitoring supplies. New Mexico flirted with cannabis legalization in the 1990s, when then-Gov. Gary Johnson challenged taboos against decriminalization in defiance of Republican allies. The state's medical marijuana program founded in 2007 has attracted more than 100,000 patients. The Legislature was reticent to legalize until now. Several hardline opponents of legalization in the state Senate were voted out of office by Democrats in 2020 primary elections, in a shift that paved the way for Wednesday’s historic vote. Under the advancing legalization package, New Mexico would levy an initial excise tax on recreational marijuana sales of 12% that eventually rises to 18%. That’s on top of current gross receipts on sales that range from roughly 5% to 9%. Possession of up to 2 ounces (57 grams) of marijuana would cease to be a crime, and people would be allowed six plants at home — or up to 12 per household. The reforms would eliminate taxes on the sales of medical marijuana and seek to ensure adequate medicinal supplies. “The United States of America is in the midst of a sea change when it comes to this,” said Democratic state Rep. Javier Martinez of Albuquerque, lead sponsor of the legalization bill. “This bill begins to repair the harms of prohibition.” State oversight would largely fall to the governor-appointed superintendent of the Regulation and Licensing Department that would issue licenses for a fee to marijuana-related businesses. The agency initially would have the authority to limit marijuana production levels by major producers — a lever over market supplies and pricing. Several senators warned against the production cap as a recipe for creating a government sanctioned monopoly, amid lobbying for price supports by some incumbent medical marijuana producers. The legalization bill creates a cannabis control division to oversee 10 types of industry licenses. Those include micro-licenses with low annual fees for small producers to grow up to 200 marijuana plants and also package and sell their products. Bill sponsor Martinez says that provides an important measure of equity, within a bill designed to support communities that suffered from criminalization of marijuana and tough policing. Past drug convictions don’t automatically disqualify applicants for marijuana business licenses. The odor of marijuana or suspicion of possession are no longer legal grounds to stop, detain or search people. Legalization bill co-sponsor Rep. Deborah Armstrong says New Mexico will respond to early pitfalls of legalization in other states as it mandates child-proof packaging for marijuana products. Public health advocates condemned provisions that allow public consumption lounges for recreational cannabis, citing the dangers of second-hand smoke and vapor to workers and patrons. Lawmakers discarded a Republican-sponsored bill from Sen. Cliff Pirtle of Roswell that emphasized low taxes in an effort to stamp out illicit weed and would have provided low-cost licenses to small pot farmers by linking fees to the number of plants in cultivation. Local governments cannot prohibit pot businesses but can regulate locations and hours of operation, under the proposal. Bill sponsors say that sheriffs and police want consistency from town-to-town on rules and enforcement. Republican state Sen. Gay Kernan of Hobbs voted against legalization and said she was amazed that legislative colleagues would support the freedom to buy mind-altering drugs amid New Mexico's struggles with poverty and opioid overdoses. “I just think it’s terribly unfair to impose this kind of significant change in our way of life and areas of the state that clearly do not welcome this,"" Kernan said. ——— Attanasio is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

""Amazon is such a huge player in the economy, and the tech sector hasn't been one that the union movement has much representation in at all,"" Alex Colvin, the dean of Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told ABC News Tuesday. ""It could be a real shift if we started to see organizing at Amazon."" Colvin said a union formation in Alabama could set a ""precedent"" and inspire other Amazon workers across the country to follow suit. ""Amazon has a lot of facilities around the country and a lot of employees,"" he added. ""If this is the start of a broader movement towards unionization at Amazon, that would be a big deal to the economy."" The National Labor Relations Board began tabulating the votes from some 5,800 workers at the Bessemer Amazon facility on Tuesday, though it is not immediately clear when the results for the vote are expected to come in. If successful, the warehouse workers will be represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). ""This campaign has already been a victory in many ways,"" RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement. ""Even though we don't know how the vote will turn out, we believe we have opened the door to more organizing around the country; and we have exposed the lengths to which employers will go to crush their employees trying to gain a union voice -- this campaign has become the prime example for why we need labor law reform in this country."" Colvin told ABC News that regardless of the way the vote turns out, ""We should anticipate a certain likelihood of an extended period of conflict over establishing collective bargaining at the workplace, we commonly see that after elections."" The Alabama workers' unionizing efforts have drawn support from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Last week, Sen.  , I-Vt., visited Alabama to meet with some of the workers involved in the unionizing efforts. ""All I want to know is why the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, is spending millions trying to prevent workers from organizing a union so they can negotiate for better wages, benefits and working conditions,"" Sanders tweeted ahead of his visit. His tweet drew ire from Amazon executive Dave Clark, who responded to Sander's tweet by noting that Vermont's minimum wage is $11.75 an hour compared to Amazon's $15, adding, ""The Sen should save his finger wagging lecture until after he actually delivers in his own backyard."" On the other side of the aisle, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has also publicly thrown his support behind the union in an   earlier this month. On the day voting began for the union,   on Twitter voicing his support for labor unions and encouraging workers to ""make your voice heard."" In response to a request for comment on the vote count commencing, Amazon told ABC News in a statement Tuesday that, ""RWDSU membership has fallen 25% during Stuart Appelbaum's tenure, but that's no justification for Mr. Appelbaum to misrepresent the facts."" The statement continued: ""Our employees know the truth -- starting wages of $15 or more, health care from day one, and a safe and inclusive workplace.

https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/victims-anti-asian-attacks-reflect-year-pandemic-76196503,lifestyle,"Nearly a year after they were almost stabbed to death inside a Midland, Texas, Sam's Club, Bawi Cung and his two sons all have visible scars. It's the unseen ones though that are harder to get over. Cung can’t walk through any store without constantly looking in all directions. His 6-year-old son, who now can't move one eyebrow, is afraid to sleep alone. On a Saturday evening in March, when COVID-19 panic shopping gripped the nation, Cung was in search of rice at a cheaper price. The family was in the Sam's Club meat section when Cung suddenly felt a punch to the back of his head. A man he didn't know then slashed his face with a knife. The assailant left but soon returned to stab the boys. He wounded the 3-year-old in the back and slashed the 6-year-old from his right eye to a couple of inches past his right ear. The grisly encounter brought home the dangerous climate Asian Americans have faced since the   entered the U.S., with racially motivated harassment and assaults occurring from coast to coast. Now, just over a year and thousands of incidents later, some of the early victims find moving forward has been difficult or, at best, bittersweet. A recent wave of attacks on elderly Asian Americans — including the death of an 84-year-old San Francisco man — has fueled worries that hostilities have only worsened. In Cung's case, the man responsible for the attack believed the Myanmar man and his children were Chinese and spreading the virus, according to the FBI. Cung said he’s not sure what would have happened had a Sam’s Club employee, Zach Owen, not intervened. “Maybe I might kill him. Maybe he might kill all of my family. I don’t know,” Cung said. “God protected my family, God sent Zach to protect my family right there at the right time.” Owen, who was stabbed in the leg and deeply cut in his right palm, and an off-duty Border Patrol agent detained the suspect, Jose Gomez, 19. Verbal attacks have also made a lasting mark. In April, a confrontation in a Richmond, California, park left an irrevocable impact not just on Kelly Yang, 36, but her children. She was forced to discuss anti-Asian racism with her son, 10, and daughter, 7 — a talk she didn't think would happen for a few more years. An elderly white couple, upset over her unleashed dog, called Yang, who is Chinese American, an “Oriental” and said the words many Asian Americans dread: “Go back where you came from.” Her children thought the couple meant for them to go home. Torn, Yang eventually explained they meant “for us to go back to Asia."" ""It means that we’re not welcome here.” Her son burst into tears. Yang believes the couple felt emboldened by then-President Donald Trump’s use of racially charged terms like “Chinese virus."" She applauded President Joe Biden's recent executive order condemning anti-Asian xenophobia as a good start. But Yang is afraid a lot of non-Asians have already shrugged off the issue as though it ceased when Trump's presidency did. “I don’t know what can be done,” said Yang, who writes young adult novels and plans to weave her experience into her next book. “But I do know talking about it, acknowledging it, remembering — that’s what we do with wars — we have to remember what happened.” Douglas Kim, 42, chef and owner of Jeju Noodle Bar in New York City, is certain COVID-19-fueled racism was behind the April vandalizing of his Michelin-starred, Korean restaurant. Someone used a Sharpie to scrawl on the winter vestibule “Stop eating dogs,” referring to a stereotype about Asian cuisines. Ultimately, Kim decided not to report it. “At the time it pissed me off, but I have more important things to worry about,"" Kim said. ""Maintaining a business is more important.” He shared a picture of the graffiti on Instagram to call attention to hate crimes. There was a groundswell of support, but he feels like much of it has faded. Yet, Kim is hopeful fewer people are stereotyping Asian Americans as foreigners who don't belong in the U.S. “I think it’s all about education,” Kim said. “If you raise your children that way, they’re gonna learn that way. I think things are changing but it’s not 100% yet. That’s why somebody obviously wrote that on our door.” More than 3,000 incidents have been reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a California-based reporting center for Asian American Pacific Islanders, and its partner advocacy groups, since mid-March 2020. What's frustrating is that the encounters don't often rise to the legal definition of a hate crime. Still, police in several major cities saw a sharp uptick in Asian-targeted hate crimes between 2019 and 2020, according to data collected by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism, California State University, San Bernardino. New York City went from three incidents to 27, Los Angeles from seven to 15, and Denver had three incidents in 2020 — the first reported there in six years. A rash of crimes victimizing elderly Asian Americans in the past two months has renewed outcry for more attention from politicians and the media. On Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed off on legislation allocating $1.4 million to Stop AAPI Hate and the UCLA Asian American Studies Center. The funding will go toward community resources and further tracking of anti-Asian hate incidents. Local officials and citizens have also taken notice. Initiatives like increased police presence, volunteer patrols and special crime hotlines are coming to fruition. Big-name brands like the Golden State Warriors and Apple, based in the Bay Area, have promised to donate to the cause. Cynthia Choi, of Stop AAPI Hate, wishes news cycles would focus not just on the latest crimes but the solutions being discussed. Policing and prosecution aren't necessarily the answers, she said. COVID-19 vitriol is rooted in more than a century of anti-Chinese and anti-immigrant attitudes. She and other advocates think more investment in education and community resources could help get at those root causes. Anti-Asian xenophobia should be part of the ongoing conversations on racial reckoning, Choi added. “Our work to address anti-Asian racism is inextricably tied to fighting anti-Black racism,” Choi said. “That’s gonna take all of us, it’s gonna take public education efforts, it’s gonna take racial solidarity efforts that really bring our communities together."" Before immigrating to the U.S. six years ago, Cung, the Texas hate crime survivor, had never encountered racism. Now, it's difficult for him to hear stories about anti-Asian American violence. Initially after the attack, Cung wrestled with how Gomez tried to kill him simply because of how he looked. Now, he prays for his attacker. As for what should happen to Gomez, who remains jailed on three counts of attempted capital murder, Cung said that's up to the courts. “I can forgive him, but we cannot accept racism or that kind of terrorist attack,” said Cung, who received more than $20,000 in online donations. One thing he is looking ahead to — life as a newly naturalized U.S. citizen in a country where “they respect people.” Cung remains unbothered that he may not fit some people's idea of what America looks like. “Maybe personally they have racism,” Cung said. “I don’t care. I’m proud of being Asian and Asian American.” ——— Tang reported from Phoenix and is a member of The Associated Press’ Race and Ethnicity team. Follow her on Twitter at https://twitter.com/ttangAP",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/spread-coronavirus-vaccinated-76806052,lifestyle,"NEW YORK -- Can I still spread the   after I’m vaccinated? It’s possible. Experts say the risk is low, but are still studying how well the shots blunt the spread of the virus. The current   are highly effective at preventing people from getting seriously sick with COVID-19. But even if vaccinated people don’t get sick, they might still get infected without showing any symptoms. Experts think the vaccine would also curb the chances of those people spreading the virus. “A vaccinated person controls the virus better, so the chances of transmitting will be greatly reduced,” said Dr. Robert Gallo a virus expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Among the evidence so far: Studies suggesting if people do get infected despite vaccination, they harbor less coronavirus in the nose than the unvaccinated. That makes it harder to spread. Trying to settle the question, the U.S. is starting a study of college students willing to undergo daily nasal swab testing. Given the uncertainty and the arrival of more contagious variants, experts say fully vaccinated people should continue to wear masks and social distance in public and when visiting with unvaccinated people at high risk for severe illness if infected. “We still have to be cautious,” Gallo said. “The vaccine is essential. But it is not a cure-all that ends the epidemic tomorrow.” Other factors can also affect the likelihood of a vaccinated person spreading the virus, including vaccination rates in the community and whether there’s an ongoing surge in cases locally. “We want to think it’s all or none, but it’s very situation-specific,” said Dr. Laraine Lynn Washer, an infectious disease expert at the University of Michigan. —— The AP is answering your questions about the coronavirus in         this series.

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the number of new cases over a 7-day period increased 7% over the previous week and hospitalizations are also increasing, which could be a warning sign for   in cases public health officials say could be avoided.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-calls-gop-passed-georgia-law-restricting-voting/story?id=76708228,politics,"President Joe Biden on Friday called a sweeping new Georgia law restricting voting access, passed by the state's Republican-led legislature, an ""atrocity,"" speaking to reporters as left the White House for Delaware. He  spoke shortly after issuing a statement on what he called the ""attack on the right to vote in Georgia,"" a state he won in November amid debunked claims of fraud. ""[I]nstead of celebrating the rights of all Georgians to vote or winning campaigns on the merits of their ideas, Republicans in the state instead rushed through an un-American law to deny people the right to vote. This law, like so many others being pursued by Republicans in statehouses across the country is a blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscience,"" Biden said in the statement. He later said the Justice Department was looking into the matter. On Thursday afternoon, Georgia Republicans voted to pass and sign into law a 90-page bill that severely limits voting rights in a previously Republican-dominated state that, besides Biden, also elected two Democratic senators in the 2020 election. Republicans said they were ensuring election integrity. When the bill was sent quickly to GOP Gov. Brian Kemp for his signature, a Democratic state representative from Atlanta, Park Cannon, went to his office, knocked on the governor's closed office door, demanding to be let in. In a scene caught on video, she was arrested by Georgia state troopers, taken from the building, and charged with a felony for obstruction of law enforcement and preventing or disrupting General Assembly sessions, according to the Georgia State Patrol. “I think anyone who saw that video would have been deeply concerned by the actions that were taken by law enforcement to arrest her when she simply, by the video that was provided, seemed to be knocking on the door to see if she could watch a bill being signed into law,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at her Friday briefing. Biden, in his statement, said he would ""take his case to the American people."" ""This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end. We have a moral and Constitutional obligation to act. I once again urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the   Voting Rights Advancement Act to make it easier for all eligible Americans access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote,"" he said in the statement. Earlier Friday, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield told CNN Biden will work to ensure the Senate passes the voting rights bill that could negate Georgia's new law, without being specific whether he would support doing   in order to get it done. ""You saw him speak to this yesterday, incredibly forcefully, you know, he said what we see going on here is sick, it's un-American,"" she said. ""So, yes, and he is going to work to push forward and ensure that we are signing this legislation into law."" However, with a very narrow Democratic majority in the Senate, passing the legislation might  , something Biden has maintained he doesn't want to do, but hinted Thursday that is might be an option to achieving policy goals. ""In terms of the filibuster, his great hope, his preference is we can work together on issues that matter tremendously to the American people,"" Bedingfield said. ""If Republicans refuse to do that, then as he said yesterday, he'll look at different options, but his hope is we can continue to work together."" ""What I'm worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It's sick. It's sick. Deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line waiting to vote? Deciding that you're going to end voting at 5:00 when working people are just getting off work? Deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances?"" Biden said at his Thursday news conference. ""It's all designed."" He kept up his criticism in Friday's statement. ""Among the outrageous parts of this new state law, it ends voting hours early so working people can’t cast their vote after their shift is over. It adds rigid restrictions on casting absentee ballots that will effectively deny the right to vote to countless voters. And it makes it a crime to provide water to voters while they wait in line – lines Republican officials themselves have created by reducing the number of polling sites across the state, disproportionately in Black neighborhoods,"" he said. Asked Friday how the voting rights issue affected his thinking on the Senate filibuster, Biden seemed to tamp down expectations. ""You know, you have to have 50 votes. 51 votes. You have to win to be able to move the filibuster, on any change in the filibuster. And right now, that doesn’t exist,"" he told reporters. ""That doesn’t exist. So, you know, look, I -- The only thing I’ve been relatively good at in my long career in the Senate is figuring out when to move and when not to move. You got to have the votes."" Georgia Gov. Kemp shot back at Biden Friday. ""There is nothing ‘Jim Crow’ about requiring a photo or state-issued ID to vote by absentee ballot – every Georgia voter must already do so when voting in-person. President Biden, the left, and the national media are determined to destroy the sanctity and security of the ballot box,"" Kemp said in a statement.",3

Their message: Send the unaccompanied minors back. On Wednesday, there were 5,156 children   and 11,900 children in the Department of Health and Human Services' custody, according to data released by HHS. Along the way, we met a mother just moments after she stepped onto U.S. soil -- her 5-year-old daughter clenching her hand. It was just after midnight. With tears in her eyes, she told me she fought to come to the United States for her daughter. She was emotional, describing the journey -- saying it's been difficult. They went many days without food. As her little girl heard her mother cry, she began crying too. ""It’s been very difficult, a lot of days fighting with hunger on the way, and it’s not easy to just come, and hide from Guatemala’s immigration officers,"" she said. ""One comes alone without anyone that can help them, one comes alone, it's very difficult"" In the mother's pocket, a laminated piece of paper with the phone number of family in Maryland. Her husband already made it there with their son from Honduras. He said the time to come is now. President Joe Biden has said now is not the time to come, but pushed back against sending unaccompanied minors home during a press conference Thursday. ""The idea that I'm going to say, which I would never do, that if an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we're just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side, no previous administration did that either, except Trump,"" Biden said. ""I’m not going to do it."" We met a 17-year-old from Guatemala who made the trip alone. He told us they he came out of ""necessity"" -- saying there weren't opportunities at home. He has no family in the United States, just the telephone number of a family friend who is a pastor. He's been on foot for more than a month. We followed more than a dozen senators to the edge of the river, Mexico just on the other side. You could hear people on rafts taunting them as they looked across. I asked Sen. Linsey Graham, D-S.C., if he believes that mother and child I just met should be sent back. ""I don't blame the mother and the daughter. I blame the policies we're creating. It’s incentivizing people to take a long dangerous journey."" he said. ""You have to stop the flow, you have to tell mother that she will no longer be released in the United States."" I asked: ""Do you want to send all the unaccompanied minors back across the border?"" ""Yes absolutely,"" he said: ""You got to shut it off, tell people not come."" Graham's message to Biden: ""End this madness. Come to the border and find out what is really happening on your watch."" Biden said during his press conference Thursday that he had not visited the border because it could put stress on an already precarious situation, though he did say he'd expand access to facilities where children are being held, especially for journalists. ""One of the reasons I haven't gone down, my chief folks have gone down, is I don't want to become the issue,"" Biden said. ""I don't want to be, you know, bringing all the secret service and everybody with me to get in the way."" I asked the senators: Were they outraged with the condition and policies under the Trump administration? ""What outrage? The outrage is that you entice people to do this,"" Graham said. He added, ""What President Biden did today at that news conference was a disaster. ... What he did is created a human tsunami that’s going to come to the United States. He didn’t mean to, but I don’t think he understands his own policies."" Sen.

This comes as the   reports it screened more than a million passengers a day since March 11. United Airlines announced it will fly 52% of its 2019 schedule this summer -- the carrier adding 26 new non-stop routes to coastal vacation destinations taking off Memorial Day Weekend. ""In the past few weeks, we have seen the strongest flight bookings since the start of the pandemic,"" Ankit Gupta, vice president of United's domestic network planning and scheduling, said in a press release. ""As we rebuild our schedule to meet that demand, adding in seasonal point-to-point flying is just one of the ways we are finding opportunities to add new and exciting service."" The new service includes flights from Midwest cities like Cleveland, Cincinnati and Milwaukee to destinations like Hilton Head, South Carolina; Pensacola, Florida; and Portland, Maine. American Airlines also announced it will add 10 new, returning and seasonal routes from Austin. ""These routes not only provide opportunities for companies to get back to business and for leisure travelers to enjoy the excitement of Austin, but also connect Central Texans with new leisure destinations they desire,"" Brian Znotins, American’s vice president of Network Planning said in a press release. In May, American Airlines will fly 80% of its 2019 May schedule. The carrier will introduce 18 new routes for the summer season, including six new routes from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York to Latin America and the Caribbean. ""We're optimistic for the summer of 2021,"" Julie Rath, American Airlines vice president of customer experience, said in an interview with ABC News.

Destinations include service to Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and Nevada. The carrier is also adding more flights to leisure markets like Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and various Caribbean destinations. On the international front, Delta announced Friday it will offer more service to Iceland this summer. This comes as the country announced it will open its borders to vaccinated Americans.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/californians-recall-gov-gavin-newsom-process-work/story?id=76677007,politics,"The effort to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom is on the verge of a major victory. There are almost enough signatures in support of the effort to get the measure on the ballot, which would give voters the option to remove the governor from office and pick his replacement. Though organizers say they are nonpartisan, Republicans are rallying around the effort. According to the California secretary of state’s office, this is the   to recall Newsom since he took office in 2019. A recall is an action powered by voters who sign a petition in support of removing an elected official from office. If organizers are able to obtain enough signatures -- in this case just under 1.5 million -- the measure goes to a statewide ballot. Voters would then be presented with a two-part question: do they want to recall Newsom, and if so, who they would like to replace him with? Newsom recently signed a bill that would mail all voters a ballot for any elections in 2021. Anyone can file to be a replacement candidate in a recall election, which often leads to a very crowded field. Organizers in the effort to recall Newsom say government overreach has led to dissatisfaction with his leadership. They cite his executive order to phase out gasoline-powered cars by 2035 and rolling power outages to prevent wildfires, among other issues. They also cite a number of issues surrounding his handling of the coronavirus. The first attempt to recall Newsom came two months after he took office and was filed alongside recall attempts taking aim at six other top Democratic officials, including the lieutenant governor, the secretary of state and the attorney general. Newsom's handling of the coronavirus pandemic appears to be the catalyst for the latest recall effort. Randy Economy, a senior adviser to the effort, told ABC News that voters are trying to take the government back. ""People really do want to take citizen government back in their hands and they don't want the politicians to control every single aspect of their lives, every single minute of the day, even during a pandemic,"" Economy said. ""We're going to fix it by getting him out of office."" Californians previously successfully recalled Gov. Gray Davis in 2003, leading to the election of former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Organizers met their final collection deadline on March 17. Their final count was just over 2.2 million signatures. Now counties have until April 29 to sift through the signatures and verify them. As of the last update on data through March 11, the state had received 1,834,770 signatures and examined 1,454,710 of them. Of those, 1,188,073 were deemed valid, giving organizers an 81.7% success rate. Recall expert Joshua Spivak told ABC News he doesn’t think organizers will have much difficulty making it to a ballot. ""Six million people voted for Donald Trump (in California),"" Spivak said. ""So with one-third of those 6 million signing this petition, forgetting Democrats, forgetting independents ... there's a good chance that will get on the ballot. That is not some crazy barrier."" Still, getting voters to cast a ballot for the recall may prove difficult. Of the total 22,154,304 registered voters in the state, 10,228,144 are Democrats, 5,347,377 are Republicans and 680,573 are independents. This is the second recall attempt primarily led by former Yolo County Sergeant Orrin Heatlie and California businessman Mike Netter. Organizers say they have raised just under $1 million in donations. Though organizers claim the effort is nonpartisan, records show contributions from the   totaling at least $100,000. The Republican National Committee has  the effort and the Republican Governor's Association recently launched a political action committee to do the same. As the signature verification rate climbed, Democrats in California and across the country launched a defensive,   and supporters of the effort to the far-right wings of the Republican Party and the QAnon conspiracy. They argue that removing a sitting governor as he tries to quell the coronavirus pandemic would be harmful to the state. Stop the Republican Recall, the campaign against the effort, is primarily funded by the California Democratic Party and has recruited national party figures, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Stacey Abrams, to help fundraise. Newsom publicly addressed the threat of a recall on ABC’s “The View,” saying it appeared that organizers had the signatures needed to send the question to a ballot. ""Am I worried about it? Of course I'm worried about it,"" Newsom said. ""The nature of these things, the up or down question, the zero-sum nature of the question is challenging...so we're taking it seriously."" The state has until April 29 to verify signatures submitted on the remaining petitions. The state then has 10 days to verify that the signatures make the required threshold. Following that, those who signed a petition have 30 days to remove their names from the list. Experts predict the question could be on a ballot by September or October. Democrats are putting up a united front of opposition to the recall and are not announcing bids for the seat. But some have reportedly quietly expressed interest in jumping in a potential governor’s race down the road. Tom Steyer, one of the failed 2020 presidential candidates who spent millions on his own race, recently commissioned a poll on a number of issues, including the recall. His spokesperson told ABC News that he opposes the recall effort and has no intention of running should it get on the ballot. Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, a Republican, has already jumped into the race and is calling on voters to elect him for a “California Comeback.” Republican John Cox, who was the party’s nominee in the 2018 gubernatorial election, has also thrown his name in the ring, as has former Republican Rep. Doug Ose.",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-takes-long-view-matter-timing-presidency-agenda/story?id=76704106,politics,"For President  , it's all about timing. Faced with an unprecedented array of crises, from the   pandemic to gun violence, Biden this week made clear that is looking back through the long lens of history as he formulates his agenda. ""Successful presidents -- better than me -- have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they’re doing -- order it, decide and prioritize what needs to be done,"" he said during a news conference Thursday. After two major mass shootings in a week, Biden made clear that crises he viewed as secondary would not deter him from staying laser-focused on his top priorities: ending the coronavirus pandemic and repairing the economy. Next up, he said, would be rebuilding America's infrastructure, a not-so-flashy task that, if he's successful, could have a lasting impact on his legacy in line with consequential presidents before him, like Franklin D. Roosevelt and his ""New Deal"" or Dwight Eisenhower and the interstate highway system. Biden's pragmatism is born out of his decades of passing bills on Capitol Hill, and it stands in stark contrast to his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. Trump often bounced from one issue to the next chasing headlines, with little interest in figuring out how to actually move his proposals across the finish line at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. ""It's a matter of timing,"" Biden said Thursday, explaining why he did not think now was the time to spend his political capital on gun control. ""When I took office,"" he told another reporter, ""I decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: I got elected to solve problems. And the most urgent problem facing the American people, I stated from the outset, was COVID-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of Americans. And so that's why I put all my focus in the beginning -- there are a lot of problems -- put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems."" Biden called the issues of immigration reform, climate change, voting rights and gun control ""long-term problems"" that have ""been around a long time."" ""And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well,"" he said. But, he added, the ""fundamental problem"" was how to help people regain their financial well being. The president met earlier this month with a group of historians, which White House press secretary Jen Psaki said was a chance to for Biden to have ""an open conversation about the challenges"" the United States is facing while ""looking back at history."" ""It's a moment to step back and reflect and use it as lessons moving forward,"" Psaki said Wednesday. After gaining passage of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package earlier this month, Biden said his next big push would be improving the nation's infrastructure -- ""so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs,"" he explained Thursday. With the United States inching out of a historic pandemic and reeling economically, Biden may seize on the moment to go big with a transformative spending plan that could have a lasting impact on the country's bridges, roads and tunnels and put thousands of Americans back to work. This week, administration officials prepared to present the president with a massive economic plan, covering infrastructure and other domestic priorities, with a total cost as high as $3 trillion, according to a White House official. Axios, which  , said it was clear during the meeting that Biden ""knew a lot about Franklin D. Roosevelt"" and asked questions about the president who brought the United States the massive relief programs and transformative policy changes that made up the 1930s New Deal. White House officials did not respond to specific questions about the meeting, which Axios reported lasted over two hours and also touched on former President Lyndon B. Johnson. But presidential historian Douglas Brinkley told ABC News that while Biden may be interested in the impact Roosevelt's New Deal had, Biden faces far greater constraints than the wildly popular, four-term Roosevelt did, nor does he enjoy a large majority of Democrats in the Senate like Johnson had. While Democrats have a slim majority in the House of Representatives, the evenly split Senate -- with ties broken by Vice President Kamala Harris -- means that the opposition of any one Democrat could prevent a bill's passage. ""The truth of the matter is, Biden is like a third Obama administration,"" Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University, said, referring to the obstructionism President Barack Obama faced from congressional Republicans. ""We are a deeply divided country, and the idea of getting a legislative agenda done without any Republican help is very hard."" While people familiar with the $3 trillion spending plans stressed they were preliminary -- as was the price tag -- if Biden moves forward, he is likely to face stiff opposition from Republicans in Congress. The president was unable to garner even one GOP vote in favor of the COVID-19 relief bill. ""I would like Republican -- elected Republican support,"" Biden said Thursday, ""but what I know I have now is that I have electoral support from Republican voters. Republican voters agree with what I'm doing."" On Thursday, Biden dismissed Republican opposition to one issue, immigration reform, by nodding to the lasting impact Trump has had on the GOP. ""I know they have to posture for a while,"" Biden said. ""They sort of got to get it out of their system. This is a -- but I’m ready to work with any Republican who wants to help solve the problem and make the situation better."" But Biden is running up against the time crunch of the traditional ""honeymoon period"" for new presidents, where their typically higher approval ratings allow them to push through more ambitious agenda items. Obama, for example, tackled major healthcare reform soon he took office. ""Since Franklin D. Roosevelt unleashed his 100 days of the New deal, there's been pressure on presidents to deliver results quickly, because the press starts saying, 'What did you do in your first 100 days?'"" Brinkley said. ""This is just part of a media culture that's developed particularly now with TV, especially in the 1950s with television. It starts becoming this big litmus test."" That dynamic is likely fueling Biden's infrastructure goals, he said. The 2022 midterms, too, are bearing down upon the president. ""There used to be a honeymoon period for presidents,"" Brinkley said. ""If that exists anymore, it's only for a couple of months.

Brian Kemp  While Iowa's governor signed a bill earlier this month imposing new restrictions on voting, the elections overhaul Kemp signed into law Thursday evening is the first major, post-2020 election legislative action in a battleground state former President Donald Trump lost and continuously contested with baseless allegations of widespread voter fraud and election irregularities. Republicans in Arizona, another new battleground state Trump lost with competitive elections next cycle,   restrictive voting legislation, but such bills are not just under consideration in  . In states with Republican governors that Trump won, like Texas and Florida, GOP legislators have also proposed legislation that would restrict voter access. In Florida, for example, one bill that has advanced through committees would eliminate the use of drop boxes entirely, which Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican who -- like Kemp -- faces reelection in 2022, advocated for. Vote-by-mail was popular in Florida pre-pandemic, and for all statewide elections between 2014 and 2018, Republicans favored the option more than Democrats. In Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, the top election official in the state, resisted pressure to overturn the presidential election in favor of Trump, but the new law now strips him of his chairmanship and voting power on the State Election Board. By a majority vote, the General Assembly will now appoint three of the five voting members of the board, including the chairperson, and by a majority vote, that board will have new power to suspend county election superintendents deemed unfit for the role and appoint temporary replacements. Voting rights is shaping up to be a defining issue of the 2022 cycle. ""I think both sides -- Democrats and Republicans -- are going to point to aspects of this to mobilize their base,"" said University of Georgia Professor Charles Bullock, an expert in Southern politics. Bullock told ABC News that Republicans will ""continue their narrative that elections in Georgia can be easily stolen,"" but point to this bill as a firewall. But it's also a useful, ""very effective message"" for Democrats, he added, who can point to the bill and build on the narrative that shaped the 2018 gubernatorial campaign, ""that Republicans are out to suppress the vote,"" but Democrats can stop them by voting. In a statement Friday, President Joe Biden echoed voting rights advocates, calling the bill ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century."" ""This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end,"" he said of the bill. ""We have a moral and Constitutional obligation to act. I once again urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to make it easier for all eligible Americans access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote."" The fight over voting rights is just getting started. The Washington-based attorney who led the charge to expand voting access during the pandemic and countered former Trump's post-election legal pursuits, Marc Elias,   against the new legislation in Georgia on behalf of the New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter and Rise. The filing came right after a Black Democratic state lawmaker was arrested for trying to witness Kemp's bill signing, which happened behind closed doors but in front of the press. A   reviewed by ABC News shows Rep. Park Cannon knocking on the door where Kemp was signing the bill. After continuing to knock, she is eventually handcuffed by state troopers who tell her she's under arrest. Protesters who had joined her at the door erupted in anger and disbelief as she was practically dragged out of the State Capitol by the officers. She faces two charges, obstruction of law enforcement and preventing or disrupting General Assembly sessions or other meetings of members, according to a statement from Georgia State Patrol obtained by ABC's Atlanta affiliate WSB. ""I’ve been released from jail. I am not the first Georgian to be arrested for fighting voter suppression. I’d love to say I’m the last, but we know that isn’t true,"" Cannon  . She said the ""closed-door signing"" of the bill was a ""product of a white supremacist system."" Nse Ufot, the CEO of the New Georgia Project accused Kemp of cowardice for signing the bill not just behind closed doors but just an hour after it was passed. Bills often go unsigned until the legislative sessions ends, which isn't until March 31. Asked what she made of the   signing the bill told her, Ufot said, ""Georgia's pale, stale, male minority has an outsized influence on our politics and they feel their grip slipping."" Rev. Raphael Warnock, Georgia's first Black senator who faces reelection in 2022, was with Cannon, one of his parishioners, after she was released from jail. ""I got news for the state of Georgia for those who are trying to take the people's voices. We're going to keep on -- in various ways, we're going to keep on knocking on that door. Because that wasn't just Representative Cannon knocking on the door,"" Warnock told reporters Friday. In his bill signing remarks, Kemp said the bill will make it ""easy to vote and hard to cheat,"" echoing Republicans in the state legislature. He also took a shot at its critics. ""Georgians will no doubt be soon overwhelmed with fancy TV ads, mailers and radio spots attacking this common-sense election reform measure. In fact, left-wing groups funded by out-of-state billionaires are already doing that now. They're using outrageous, false rhetoric to scare you and put millions of dollars in their own pocket,"" Kemp said. ""According to them, if you support voter ID for absentee ballots, you're a racist. According to them, if you believe in protecting the security and sanctity of the ballot box, you're a 'Jim Crow in a suit and tie.'"" In Georgia, there ""is a long history of aggressively and intentionally suppressing Black votes that needs to be addressed,"" said Ufot, but she added that, ""an attack on our democracy and an attack on the right to vote is an attack on us all."" She told ABC News that the GOP is threatened by the changing demographics and electorate, in Georgia and across the country. ""The current version of the Republican Party and people who champion their policies see this rise in a multiracial, multiethnic progressive majority as a threat to their future prospects ... America's Browning. We're moving towards a multiracial, multiethnic majority, and Georgia is just the tip of the spear,"" she said. ""They think that they can no longer win on their ideas.""",3

https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/wireStory/bread-cameos-year-income-broadway-stage-76415101,lifestyle,"NEW YORK -- A year ago, Max Kumangai was dazzling crowds with a jolt of live Broadway excitement. Now he’s doing it with his bread. The triple threat from the musical “Jagged Little Pill” has leaned into a fourth skill as the pandemic marches on: baking and selling his own sourdough. From his Manhattan apartment, Kumangai delivers $15 bread loaves or $8 focaccia slices from his         Humpday Dough company on foot or via subway. “I wanted to make connecting with people — at a time when it was difficult to connect — a part of the business,” he says. “It’s feeding me figuratively and literally.” With TV and film sets slowly gearing back up a year after COVID-19 hit, Broadway theaters are still shuttered with no end in sight. That means people who make their living in live entertainment have had to be creative. Out-of-work seamstresses are selling handmade jewelry and plush toys on Etsy, dancers are teaching classes online and actors are doing voiceover work, podcasts or selling video shout-outs on Cameo. “This is a paycheck-to-paycheck profession. We are workers,” says Laura Benanti, a Tony winner. “It’s really deeply upsetting to me that there are so many people suffering, unable to feed themselves. They don’t have savings.” According to         a new report from the New York State Comptroller, employment for New York City workers in the arts, entertainment and recreation sectors fell 66% during the pandemic. The drop — from 87,000 jobs in February 2020 to 34,100 jobs just three months later — marks the largest employment decline out of all sectors in the city’s economy. It has left Broadway workers, many who have lost health insurance, living on side gigs, stimulus checks and unemployment assistance. “I’ve had a lot of friends who just picked up and relocated and moved to different states because we’re staying in one of the most expensive states in the country,” says Jawan M. Jackson, a star of “Ain’t Too Proud — The Life and Times of The Temptations.” He pivoted to putting out a single, filming a movie and got into commercials. He wished government leaders would do more. “We kind of feel like we are just afterthoughts,” he said. “I just wish they would have been a little bit better during the shutdown for us because of the predicament that we’re in. But hopefully it’s going to change. We’ll see.” Others are more blunt: “These artists need to be protected. They need to be supported. This is dire straits right now,” said Tom Kitt, a Pulitzer Prize-winning composer. “This is the lifeblood of this city.” Theater work even without a pandemic is usually a piecemeal existence. Shows rarely run for years and workers live a nomadic existence, jumping to new works every few years. These days, they're even more piecemeal since people who make live theater will clearly be the last back at work. “You pick up things where you can. I know a lot of people that have taken on side gigs when they can. A lot of people have gone back to school,” said Derek Klena, a Tony-nominee. “You do what you can to get by.” Musician Andrew Griffin had landed a great gig playing viola for “Ain’t Too Proud"" when the pandemic shut down his steady gig. He has cobbled together a few live concerts, composed for a dance company and done some consulting work. He's seen people selling their instruments and their cars. One woman close to him has even sold her eggs. “It’s definitely been very challenging and very stressful in a lot of different ways,” he says. Some of Broadway's leading men — including Jeremy Jordan, Max von Essen, Corey Cott and Adam Pascal — have turned to         Cameo, which pays celebrities to make personalized videos for fans. “I’ve clawed my way to paying those bills each month,” says Pascal, a Tony-nominee for “Rent” who has made his own rent this year teaching masterclasses and with concerts. “Pivoting in whatever way I’m able to pivot.” Some of Broadway's leading ladies — from Patti Murin, Cassie Levy, Kerry Butler, Lilli Cooper to Ashley Park — have been coaching, singing and answering questions virtually on         Broadway Booker, which pivoted from hosting in-person events to online ones. A 30-minute private coaching session from a veteran can start at $75. Broadway dancer Jen Frankel lost her job but quickly become an employer: She co-founded the virtual dance platform         PassDoor, hiring suddenly out-of-work Broadway veterans to teach all skill levels or ages. “We thought, 'Here’s an opportunity for not only us to help the Broadway community, but also to help everybody by giving them a chance to dance with people that they never would have.” Bebe Neuwirth, a two-time Tony winner who also starred on “Cheers,” works with dancers on career transitions and worries about the losses to her art form from the pandemic. “I know a lot of dancers are saying, ‘OK, I got to get a scholarship and go back to school and do something, because I can’t make it work,’” she says. ""Who knows what those dancers might have done if they’d stayed?” ——— Mark Kennedy is at         http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits",1
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-receives-high-marks-covid-19-lags-immigration/story?id=76722985,politics,"As he confronts a set of concurrent challenges, President Joe Biden receives high marks on his top priorities -- the   pandemic and the economic recovery. Still, there are warning signs for other areas of his agenda where external events have imposed new urgency, a new   finds. The president's approval lands at 72% for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, numerically higher than the 68% of Americans who   just before Congress passed his $1.9 trillion relief package, his first  . Only 28% disapprove of his response in the poll, which was conducted by Ipsos in partnership with ABC News using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel. A significant slice of the country also backs how Biden is handling distribution of the COVID-19  , with 3 in 4 Americans approving. More than one-third of the adult population (35%) has received at least one dose, according to the most recent report from the  . On Thursday, Biden opened his   as president by pledging to double his initial goal on administering vaccines to 200 million doses by the end of his first 100 days in office. A clear majority of Americans (60%) also approve of Biden's stewardship on repairing the beleaguered economy, which continues to be hobbled by the coronavirus, and nearly 4 in 10 Americans disapprove. Biden's standing on the pandemic is buttressed by overwhelming support from those who identify with his party, with about 9 in 10 Democrats approving of his handling of the public health crisis (96%), vaccine delivery (92%) and the economic response (89%). Strong majorities of independents also approve of Biden on all three fronts: 74%, 77% and 63%, respectively. Notably, in these polarized times, a majority of Republicans (53%) also approve of Biden's handling of vaccine distribution. Fewer than half, however, view his overall response to the pandemic (44%) and his leadership on the economy (23%) positively. Biden, at the same time, is facing some early tests in his first two months in office, finding himself underwater for his handling of gun violence   in a week and the   crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, which has brought at least 18,000 unaccompanied children into U.S. custody. An equal 57% of Americans disapprove of his approach on both issues, while just over 4 in 10 Americans approve. As Biden attempts to balance the various intervening forces, he   that he viewed the two issues of gun control and   as secondary to the pandemic and its fallout, calling them ""long-term problems"" despite their increasing urgency. ""They've been around a long time. And what we're going to be able to do, God willing, is now begin one at a time to focus on those as well,"" he said at the first press conference on Thursday. ""Successful presidents -- better than me -- have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they're doing -- order it, decide and prioritize what needs to be done,"" he later added. Republicans are   at the southern border as a ""crisis"" -- a term that White House aides have refused to invoke while also acknowledging the troubling circumstances -- and accusing the current administration's hasty rollback of tough immigration policies implemented by former President Donald Trump as the cause. A majority of Americans (54%) call the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border a crisis, and another 42% believe it is a serious problem but not a crisis. Only 4% of Americans say it is not a serious problem. The issue of immigration is one of the most polarizing among those included in the poll, with clear majorities of Republicans (89%) and independents (54%) disapproving of Biden, while one-third of Democrats say the same. Similarly, Biden's handling of gun violence draws disapproval from 86% of Republicans, 56% of independents and 37% of Democrats -- the highest dissatisfaction among members of his own party of the issues asked about in the survey. The disapproval from both sides is likely seen by Republicans as pursuing too many gun restrictions and by some Democrats as not acting quickly enough. The president suggested on Thursday that he wouldn't expend his political capital on gun control reform right now, a view that appears at odds with most of the country. Roughly two-thirds of Americans in the poll said that enacting new laws to try to reduce gun violence should be a higher priority now, while 34% believe protecting gun rights should take precedence. Biden has repeatedly underlined a desire to unify the country after four years with a divisive Trump at the helm, but so far, he's made little headway. While 30% of Americans think Biden is making the country more united, the same percentage think he is making it more divided. A plurality of 40% view his presidency as neutral on national unity. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans (66%) think Biden is further dividing the country, and a combined 33% say he's either improving unity (5%) or having no effect (28%). Among Democrats, 95% say Biden is making the country more united (55%) or having no effect either way (40%), while 5% say he's perpetuating divisions. Independents are more split: 28% say more united, 26% say more divided and 46% say neither.",3
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/georgia-lawmaker-shaken-resolved-arrest-election-bill-signing/story?id=76725949,politics,"Following the arrest of Rep. Park Cannon D-Ga., for knocking on the door while Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a sweeping election bill this week, her attorney said Cannon is ""shaken but resolved"" to continue the fight for voting rights in Georgia -- and to clear her name. Cannon faces charges of obstructing law enforcement and disrupting a general assembly session after she repeatedly knocked on the door of Kemp's office as he held a private livestream of the bill signing. The 90-page bill adds new voting requirements for Georgia residents following the results of the 2020 election that flipped the traditionally red state to blue. A viral video of Cannon, who is a Black woman, being forcibly escorted out of the statehouse by Georgia state troopers, even after she identified herself as a state representative, sparked national outrage. She argued that the public and other members of the General Assembly should be allowed to witness the event. ""It reminds us of the 50s and the 60s in Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia and South Carolina,"" Cannon's attorney, Gerald Griggs, said. ""But I think the governor needs to understand that we are not going to sit back on George Wallace type tactics and not respond the same way we responded to George Wallace. So I think the rest of the country needs to take a very strong look at the tactics that are being used in Georgia. The Justice Department needs to get involved. There needs to be passage of the   Voting Rights Act to protect voting rights. And we need the Justice Department to crack down on the tactics of these local and state officials that are trying to silence voters and silence people."" Griggs said Cannon was arrested in an area that state lawmakers normally have access to and added she did not expect to be apprehended by law enforcement. ""She has access to all parts of the People's House and so there was no indication that the ceremony should have been closed off. Many times when a governor signs bills that are going to go into law, it's open to the public, to the press and to other members of the House of Representatives and the state Senate,"" Griggs said. Griggs told ABC News that Cannon plans to return to the Georgia State Capitol on Monday to keep working. He also said the state of Georgia should expect a ""prolonged legal fight"" even if charges are dismissed. ""She'll be doing the job that she was elected to do for her district and the people of Georgia. And as far as the charges are concerned, they're just allegations at this point. They have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Griggs said. ""The constitution of the state of Georgia is quite clear on that a duly elected representative cannot be arrested during a session. That's a violation of the Constitution unless there are three exceptions: One would be a felony, two would be a breach of the peace and three would be a treason. We believe, based on the facts and evidence that we have uncovered so far, neither of those exceptions apply,"" he added. Griggs said he and Cannon's team are in touch with the district attorney's office and are hopeful that the charges will be dismissed. He also said Kemp and Cannon have not spoken to each other since the incident -- and that Kemp has not reached out. Griggs wouldn't say if Cannon is owed an apology. President Joe Biden, Stacey Abrams, Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock and other prominent Democrats have expressed support for Cannon, many sharing photos that compare her to civil rights protesters in the 1960s. When asked if that was her intention, Griggs said she's trying to ""make sure that the voices of the voters in her district and around the state of Georgia were amplified."" Kemp has defended the bill and his decision to sign it into law and continued to do so Saturday on Fox News. ""Well, I can truthfully look in the camera and ask my African American friends and other African Americans in Georgia to simply find out what's in the bill versus the blank statement of this is Jim Crow or this is voter suppression, or this is racist -- because it is not,"" Kemp said.",3
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-28-21-white-house-communications-director/story?id=76732573,politics,"ANNOUNCER: ""This Week With George Stephanopoulos"" starts right now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JONATHAN KARL, ""THIS WEEK"" CO-ANCHOR (voice-over):  President Biden's first press conference. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Please, please sit down. Thank you. KARL:  Facing a crisis at the border. QUESTION:  Is what's happening inside acceptable to you? BIDEN:  That's a serious question, right? Is it acceptable to me? Come on. That is totally unacceptable. KARL:  And under pressure to act on gun violence. BIDEN:  It's a matter of timing. KARL:  Plus: the battle over voting rights. GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA):  Georgia will take another step to ensuring our elections are secure, accessible and fair. KARL:  Georgia's governor saying the new law will make elections more secure. But with no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud, critics are calling it a way to suppress the vote. BIDEN:  It's an atrocity. This is nothing but punitive, designed to keep people from voting. KARL:  With his agenda on the line, does Biden want to change the way the Senate does business? BIDEN:  We're going to get a lot done. And if we have to, if there's complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we will have to go beyond what I'm talking about. KARL:  We cover it all this morning with White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield and Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, plus our powerhouse roundtable. And Biden sets a new vaccine goal. BIDEN:  Two hundred million shots in 100 days. KARL:  But the pandemic is far from over. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR:  I'm quite concerned about the rise, because we have seen this pattern before. KARL:  The latest with Dr. Ashish Jha. (END VIDEOTAPE) ANNOUNCER:  From ABC News, it's ""This Week."" Here now, chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Karl. KARL:  Good morning, and welcome to ""This Week."" President Biden's first press conference was a reminder of just how much has changed since his predecessor left the White House. Biden, who waited more than two months to have his first press conference, seems to want his policies to take center stage, not himself. And that may be the most profound difference between the 45th and 46th presidents. Perhaps it's not surprising, then, that public opinion on Biden's work so far varies dramatically depending on the issue. In a ABC News/Ipsos poll out this morning, Biden has a sky-high approval rating when it comes to his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine distribution, and economic recovery. But when it comes to his handling of gun violence and the situation at the border with Mexico, most Americans don't approve. In other words, President Biden is off to a good start on issues where he has been able to set the agenda, but not so much on issues where the real world has interfered. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BIDEN:  Successful electoral politics is the art of possible. KARL (voice-over):  The art of the possible, but the Biden agenda is ambitious, aiming at as big an expansion of government as anything since LBJ's Great Society, although, in his first presidential press conference, President Biden's sought to downplay expectations. BIDEN:  Successful presidents better than me have been successful in large part because they know how to time what they're doing, order it, decide priorities. KARL:  His first priority was COVID relief, next up, something bigger. BIDEN:  Rebuild the infrastructure, both physical and technological infrastructure in this country. KARL:  But, as just about every president learns... DAVID MUIR, ABC NEWS:  Tonight, breaking news as we come on the air, a gunman opening fire at a grocery store. KARL:  ... the real world imposes its own priorities, with mass shootings in Atlanta and Colorado, pressure yet again to act on gun safety and mental health, missile launches and more threats from North Korea, and, at the border, a massive influx of children and families and a system simply unable to deal with it. On Mexico's border with California, some migrants have worn T-shirts saying, ""Biden, please let us in."" Others have said they are coming because that is exactly what they expect the new president to do. BIDEN:  That's the reason why it's happening, that I'm a decent man or however it's phrased, that that's why they're coming, because they know Biden's a good guy. The truth of the matter is, nothing has changed. KARL:  While surges this time of year are common, and the president has said migrants should not make the dangerous journey, much has changed. We are now seeing record numbers of unaccompanied children crossing the border. There are now more than 18,000 unaccompanied minors in U.S. custody. ABC's Cecilia Vega met 9-year-old Yossell after he took the treacherous journey from Honduras without his parents. QUESTION:  So, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging, in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process, encouraging families like Yossell's to come? BIDEN:  The idea that I'm going to say, which I would never do, that unaccompanied child ends up at the border we’re just going to let them starve to death and stay on the other side. No previous administration did that either, except Trump. I'm not going to do it. (END VIDEO CLIP) JON KARL, ABC HOST, (OFF-CAMERA): Visiting the border this week, a group of republican senators told our Rachel Scott that children should be sent back home. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RACHEL SCOTT, ABC CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We just met a mother -- SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R-SC): Yes. SCOTT: -- with her 5-year-old. GRAHAM: Yes. SCOTT: She was in tears -- GRAHAM: Yes. SCOTT: -- crossing the border. GRAHAM: Yes. SCOTT: What do you do? Do you send that mother and her 5-year-old child -- GRAHAM: Absolutely. SCOTT: -- back across the border? GRAHAM: Absolutely. Yes, you do. SCOTT: They should go back across the border -- GRAHAM: Absolutely. SCOTT: -- after making this trek here -- GRAHAM: You do not -- SCOTT: -- looking for a better life GRAHAM: Absolutely -- SCOTT: -- looking for asylum. GRAHAM: There's the legal way to get here and there's the illegal way to get here. I don't blame them. I blame us. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL, (OFF-CAMERA): The Biden administration has refused to allow journalists to see the inside the most crowded facilities housing migrants at the border. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNKNOWN: Will you commit to transparency on this issue? BIDEN: I will commit to transparency, and as soon as I am in a position to be able to implement what we're doing right now. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL, (OFF-CAMERA): But the Republican senators did get a look inside and they released their own images. Overcrowded under any circumstances, especially during a pandemic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SCOTT: Can you describe for us what you saw? SEN. TED CRUZ, (R-TX): I think the most striking was the Donna facility. Literally side by side children who are lying down -- lying down on the floor. They don't have beds. They're lying down on the floor. They're right next to each other. They're touching each other. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL (ON-CAMERA): A lot to cover this morning with our first guest, White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield. Kate, we thank you very much for joining us on this Sunday. I want to start with those images from the Donna detention center. I mean, obviously not acceptable, horrific. Not acceptable by the definition put forward by the president himself. What is the immediate problem to address this and when will it be fixed?KATE BEDINGFIELD, WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Well, the president is working as quickly as possible to address the situation. He's using every possible avenue to ensure that we're getting these kids out of Border Patrol custody and into HHS facilities as quickly as possible. You've seen him just this week announce that Fort Bliss, for example, and Lackland Air Force base are going to open up beds to bring these kids out of the Border Patrol facilities and into facilities that are better for temporary housing for them, but that's a temporary solution. It's a temporary solution. Ultimately what we need to do is address the root causes of migration. It's something that President Biden did when he was vice president. He spent time in the Northern Triangle countries that people are migrating from, working to try to address the lack of infrastructure, the lack of programs, like for example, girls and boys clubs that allow these kids to be somewhere safe in their home country. So you saw last week, he asked Vice President Harris to take on dealing with the work and the diplomacy that's necessary in the Northern Triangle to prevent people from making this journey in the first place. That's the most important thing we can do to try to stem the tide. And the other thing I would say, Jon, is what we see from the data is that these surges are cyclical. They’re cyclical. They're not the result of one administration's policies or another administration's policies. They’re the result of, for example, weather disasters in the region. They're the result of people fleeing poverty and violence. So we saw spikes in 2014. We saw them in 2019 when the Trump administration had perhaps the cruelest imaginable policies in place, family separation to try to deter people from coming, and they still came. So this is a cyclical issue. It’s one that President Biden has said is unacceptable to him and he's working very quickly to address it. KARL: But, Kate, there is something different here, and that is the unaccompanied minors, and we already have a record number of unaccompanied minors in U.S. custody. And in just a single day last week, there were 1,000 additional minors who were caught capturing -- who were brought into U.S. custody coming across the border. These are record numbers already, and the seasonal surge that you’re talking about is only just beginning. This is not -- I mean, in terms of unaccompanied numbers, this is not the same as it's been. This is worse. Is it not? BEDINGFIELD: Well, no. And if you look at the numbers, it's not -- KARL: But the numbers -- BEDINGFIELD: -- but that doesn’t mean it’s not a serious -- but that doesn't mean -- but, Jon -- I’m sorry. Go ahead. KARL: No, but I'm saying these are already record numbers of unaccompanied minors, a thousand in a single day. BEDINGFIELD: And it’s -- KARL: Already record numbers. It’s not the same -- BEDINGFIELD: And the president -- and the president -- and the -- it is the -- it is the same. These are the same kinds of surges that we've seen. But look, the important thing here, it's not a question of whether it's the same or not, the important thing here is the president has said this is unacceptable to him and he's working to address it. And the way we do that is by finding temporary shelter for these kids who are coming without an adult and also by speeding up the process, by ensuring that the process is more efficient so that kids are able to move out of these Border Patrol facilities into temporary housing and then be put into the -- into immigration processes. That's what we're working to try to do as quickly as possible. But I think it's also important to be clear that our policy hasn't changed. The vast majority of people who arrive at our border we're turning away under Title 42, under a health code that requires us to or allows us to turn people away in this period of COVID. So people should understand that the vast majority of people who show up at our border we're turning away. For these unaccompanied children who arrive, the president is working as quickly as possible to move them into facilities that are acceptable, that are in and of themselves, short-term -- short-term solutions, and he's working to rebuild our system of diplomacy in the Northern Triangle so that people are not fleeing these countries coming to the United States. That's how we ultimately solve the problem. KARL:  Congressman Henry Cuellar, who is a Democrat and also somebody very familiar with that border region, has said that the administration should show images, should show video of people being turned away at the border, to send that message of visual representation of that message that most people are being turned away. Is that something that the administration is considering doing? BEDINGFIELD:  Well, I think the president has been very clear the border is closed. He has said so unequivocally many, many times. And we’re working -- our State Department is working to show media in country -- in the countries in the Northern Triangle that make very clear, that the border is not open, and that coming to make this incredibly dangerous journey now is coming to our border is not -- this is not the moment to do it. This is not the time to do it. The border is closed. But, you know, what I would say more prod broadly is, you know, this is also an issue that Democrats and Republicans have historically shared a desire to work on. And so this is a moment where, you know, you talked about Republicans going to visit these facilities. You know, this is a moment for Republicans to come to the table, to work with us on comprehensive immigration reform. President Biden sent a bill to Congress on his first day in office, addressing some of the broken pieces of our administration system and working to, for example -- KARL:  OK. BEDINGFIELD:  -- create a pathway to citizenship for 11 million people in this country. So, there are opportunities to work together and constructively. That's what the American people want us to do. That's what President Biden wants to do. KARL:  So, Kate, I want to turn to Georgia's new restrictions -- the new restrictive voting law down there. The president, obviously, harshly critical, many others as well. We see talk from Major League Baseball potentially moving the all-star game which is scheduled for this summer in Atlanta as a form of protest. Also, there's even been calls for the Masters to be removed -- to be moved out of Augusta. Does the administration support these kind of moves by the sports and entertainment industry to effectively boycott Georgia because of this? BEDINGFIELD:  Well, I think President Biden has been pretty clear how he feels about the legislation. He called it sick. He called it un-American. He said that it runs counter to everything that we stand for as Americans. He believes that we need to pass the For the People Act, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. This is something that he’s going to push to ensure that we're signing into law. So, I think he's been very clear. He believes this is un-American. It's unacceptable, and he's also said, you know, if you have the best ideas, put them on the table, and let people vote. There's -- the idea that you need to suppress the vote or prevent people in this country from voting in order to win, I mean, it truly runs counter to everything that we believe as Americans. So, he's been very clear about how he feels about this. Obviously, the private sector and private companies will make decisions on their own, but he's been clear this is entirely unacceptable to him, and he’s going to work to ensure that Congress is passing laws that protect people’s right to vote. KARL:  I mean, one thing that is truly concerning about this, these efforts are entirely party line. These are Republicans, these are partisan efforts. But even the effort in Congress to try to combat this is entirely without Republican support. I want to show you something that Joe Manchin said about the effort in Congress to ensure voting rights. He said: Pushing through legislation of this magnitude on a partisan basis may garner short-term benefits, but it will inevitably only exacerbate the distrust that millions of Americans harbor against the U.S. government. So, does -- I mean, obviously, Joe Biden ran for president talking about bringing the country together. This seems to be a really tough one. Does he find -- is he going to be able to find a way to get Republicans -- Republicans in Congress on board in a bipartisan effort to deal with how we conduct our elections? BEDINGFIELD:  Well, this is a question for the Republicans, isn't it, Jon? KARL:  Well, it’s a question -- (CROSSTALK) BEDINGFIELD:  I mean, they're the ones who are saying that they can't support -- KARL:  It's a question for President Biden on, you know, what is his plan to try to, you know, bring Republicans on board to this, or are they a lost cause? I mean, how does the White House view this? BEDINGFIELD:  That's -- I would say that's a question for them, that President Biden has been very clear that this is something he believes needs to happen. You know, we -- there's a lot of conversation about how this legislation could move forward in the Senate and discussion of what we need to do to the filibuster. But, you know, I thought Senator Warnock was right on about this yesterday or a couple of days ago when he said, you know, we wouldn't have to be talking about the filibuster if Republicans were talking about supporting voting rights. So this is a question for Republicans. Are they going to look their constituents in the eye and say, I spent my time in Washington trying to make it harder for you to cast your vote? Is that really the argument that they want to take back to their constituents? That's a question for them. President Biden has been very, very clear. He believes that we need to move forward with this legislation, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the For the People Act. We need to protect people's right to vote. It is a sacred right in this country. It's something that he intends to fight for. And if Republicans are going to choose not to come along, then that's something they're going to have to answer to their voters for. And I think that they're not going to like the answer that they get back. KARL: All right, Kate Bedingfield, White House communications director, thank you for joining us this morning. BEDINGFIELD: Thank you for having me, Jon. Appreciate it. KARL: All right, so let's take some of those questions right now to Republican senator from Alaska, Dan Sullivan. Senator Sullivan, thank you very much for joining us. I want to -- I know you just got back from the border. I want to ask you about that. But, first, let's pick it up with this question of voting rights. This new law in Georgia, and I know you're not from Georgia, but this is the -- this is a Republican law, you know, pushed through only by Republicans -- actually makes it a crime to give people food and water while they are waiting in line to vote. How -- how is something like that justifiable or -- or do you have problems with that? SEN. DAN SULLIVAN, (R) ALASKA: Well, look, Jon, good morning first and good to be on the show. And, you know, I don't know the details of the law in Georgia. There's been different interpretations by different groups. You know, I do know the details of the laws in Alaska. And when I was attorney general, as a U.S. senator, I've actually been a strong supporter, I've fought for expansive voting opportunities and rights, particularly for indigenous Alaskans, which is a huge minority group in my state. But I will tell you this, I think it's really important to have this discussion on voting rights, on voting integrity, on access to the ballot. But I think it's also really important if we're going to be bipartisan in this, is to be able to have this conversation without -- when anyone in the Congress -- that's us -- if we oppose what Speaker Pelosi is putting forward, that it immediately kind of devolves into an accusation that somehow we're supporting Jim Crow-like policies. That is an argument that is frequently coming from our Democratic colleagues, Speaker Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, even the president, and it doesn't help advance the issue. It doesn't help bring unity. It doesn't help bring a bipartisan nature to this. I'll just tell you, in my state -- KARL: But -- but -- SULLIVAN: Go -- I'm sorry, go ahead. KARL: But -- but -- but -- but -- but -- but to be clear, I mean, the law in Georgia, I mean this is -- there's not -- no question for interpretation. It makes it a misdemeanor offense to bring -- if you are not a poll worker, to bring people food and water while they are waiting in line. And, of course, we've seen very long lines in Georgia. And it's not just Georgia. There are efforts -- Republican-led efforts in 43 states to restrict voting in one way or another. Things like restricting the number of drop boxes, making it harder to vote absentee, restricting early voting. Why is it that Republicans seem to believe at this moment in time that -- that -- that they want fewer people to vote? That they -- that -- that their -- that the right thing to do is to have fewer people voting in our elections? SULLIVAN: Well, let me just make a point on -- on my state. In Alaska, a Republican state, we have policies like no excuse absentee ballots. In essence, automatic voter registration that is much more open to voters in Alaska. KARL: But it -- it -- SULLIVAN: Just, real quick. KARL: Yes. SULLIVAN: Than many blue states like New York, Delaware, Connecticut. So, again, we're not arguing that somehow relative to Alaska those are -- those states are pushing Jim Crow policies. But to your point, normally, in -- in -- you were talking about this with Kate, normally in our -- when you look at the history in our country, individual voting issues in states is not normally the reason that the impetus to bring major bipartisan, national federal legislation unless there is strong bipartisan support for this. And so I think that's the key issue. And, right now, H.R. 1, the Pelosi bill from the House, is -- not only doesn't have support from Republicans, it doesn't have support from many Democrats.  So, again, the key issue here is to work on this issue in a bipartisan nature.  You know, the last major voting reform bill... KARL:  Yes, I mean, no question, no question and -- I mean, this effort should be bipartisan, but the efforts we're seeing in the states are entirely partisan.  These are coming from Republicans.  Before we leave this topic, I just want to play something that Ben Ginsburg, who may be the leading Republican expert on voting laws, lawyer Ben Ginsburg had to say about these efforts. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BEN GINSBERG, REPUBLICAN VOTING LAWS EXPERT:  I think they are making a mistake any time you put up barriers to people voting in a democracy.  Both on the policy grounds, because it's anti- the way the country should work, but also politically because it paints Republicans as truly not wanting people to vote. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  So I hear from what you're saying that you're not generally supportive of this idea of restricting.  So we can -- we can move on to your trip to the border.  You just came back from the border with Mexico.  Give me a sense of what you saw.  How are you seeing the problem down there? SULLIVAN:  Look, Jon, first, it's heartbreaking, what you see.  And it's shocking.  And what I've been calling for, in a respectful way, I try to work in a bipartisan way, is for the president, for the vice president to come down and to see what we saw, to hear what we heard from officials who are on the front lines.  But I would disagree with Kate on a number of things.  There is an open border policy.  There is a catch and release policy.  And these were changes that the Biden administration instituted. And here's the thing, they were warned.  We talked to the officials who briefed the Biden team during the transition.  They were warned that if they undertook these major policy changes, getting rid of, for example, the remain in Mexico policy, and making sure that exceptions to Title 42 for families bringing 6-year-olds or under, and for unaccompanied minors, if they made those changes, which they did, that they would see this surge. So to me it was shocking.  I think the president and the vice president need to go down there, see what I saw, see what the other Republicans and Democrat congressmen are coming down there.  There are things that we can do immediately to address the challenges there.  But right now it is open borders.  It's a humanitarian and also health crisis that we need to address. KARL:  Well, I mean, the numbers from CBP showed that actually the majority of adults crossing the border are being sent back. But before you go, I want to ask you about something we heard from former President Trump talking about January 6th, and about the efforts from the Justice Department to -- to hold those accountable that invaded the Capitol.  He said that the members of that -- of those rioters are, quote, ""being persecuted."" Is that -- is that how you see it, this DoJ effort to -- you know, to charge the people that went into the Capitol?  Is that persecution or is that rightful prosecution? SULLIVAN:  No.  Look, Jon, I don't agree with that.  Here's the key issue, and it's a really important distinction.  The people who committed violence, and I condemn that violence from the minute it started happening, should be fully prosecuted.  I think the vast majority of Americans, Democrats and Republicans fully agree with that.  No doubt about it.  I've condemned it. The broader issue though is if you -- if you were at the broader rally, the vast majority of the people at the rally on January 6th did not commit violence, did not storm the Capitol, and I think it's really important.  By the way, I had a lot of Alaskans who were there acting peacefully. KARL:  Sure. SULLIVAN:  I think it's really important for people who came to support that rally that they are not tarnished, canceled, their voices shouldn't be silenced.  So I think it's two very different issues here. KARL:  We're talking about the people that went into the Capitol. Now before you go, the president has also said that he is going to work hard to defeat your colleague, your Republican colleague from Alaska, Lisa Murkowski.  In fact, the Alaska Republican Party has actually not only censured her, but called for her to be defeated.  What -- I know you have a -- I've always thought, it seems, you have a good relationship with Senator Murkowski.  What do you make of those efforts by President Trump and your own party leadership in Alaska to see her defeated? SULLIVAN:  Well, look, when I ran in 2014 and beat a Democrat incumbent and we got the Senate majority back, Senator Murkowski was a strong supporter of mine.  And in 2016 I supported her.  And just in my re-election in 2020, where, you know, the national Democratic Party came in big in Alaska, massive amount of money, Senator Murkowski was a strong supporter of mine and we won that re-election very strongly.  Look, we don't agree on everything, but we make a good team for Alaska and... KARL:  So you support her?  You support her. SULLIVAN:  Yes.  If Senator Murkowski runs again, I'm going to support her. KARL:  OK.  Thank you very much, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, appreciate you joining us. SULLIVAN:  Thanks, Jon.  Thank you. KARL:  Up next, more fallout over that controversial new election law in Georgia.  Nate Silver has a fresh take for us.  And the Powerhouse Roundtable is here with us to weigh in.  We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA):  With Senate Bill 202, Georgia will take another step toward ensuring our elections are secure, accessible and fair. Ensuring the integrity of the ballot box isn't partisan. It's about protecting the very foundation of who we are as Georgians and Americans. SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA):  Either we're a democracy or we're not. Either we believe in the idea of one person, one vote, or we don't. Either I'm a citizen or I'm not. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  Dueling reactions to Georgia's new voting law. It comes in the wake of a presidential election that saw the largest turnout in more than a century. But after then President Trump spent months making false claims of election fraud, Republican lawmakers across the country are now rushing to enact new restrictions on voting. FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver analyzes the potential impact. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATE SILVER, ABC NEWS SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT:  There's a reason why, historically, Republicans have tried to make it harder for people to vote. Looking at changes in state voting laws since the 1990s, our research at FiveThirtyEight found that, in general, when voting laws are eased, it tends to help Democrats, and when they are restricted, it tends to help Republicans. Based on the historical data, imposing a sweeping set of new restrictions might help a Republican candidate by as much as 2 to 3 percentage points in forthcoming elections. That's significant, given how close many elections are these days. But, as they warn you when you're buying stocks, past performance is no guarantee of future results. That might also be the case when it comes to voting laws. Here's why. Before Trump, the GOP tended to win the votes of so-called high-propensity voters, meaning people who voted in nearly every election. These voters tended to be suburban and college-educated. But, lately, those voters have been leaning more Democratic, especially in states like Georgia, where Joe Biden deep front by 15 points among college grads. So, we can no longer assume lower turnout always helps the GOP. In the Georgia Senate run-off, where turnout was 10 percent lower than in November, Democratic performance actually improved. Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to reduce mail-in voting in several states, but in 2020, it was a new maybe COVID-related phenomenon. In Florida, for example, mail voting had historically been a program that Republican voters took more advantage of. With that said, I don't want to take this too far. A lot of GOP changes are aimed at hampering turnout among black voters by limiting programs like Souls to the Polls. So, my advice, it will probably make life harder for Democrats, but there's a chance it could backfire. (END VIDEOTAPE) KARL:  Thanks, Nate. Now let's get to our roundtable. Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel; Margaret Hoover, the host of “The Firing Line” on PBS, also a CNN contributor; Ramesh Ponnuru, Bloomberg Opinion columnist, and senior editor at “The National Review”; and Leah Wright-Rigueur, professor of history at Brandeis University. So, let me -- let me start with you, Ramesh. What -- help me understand why these in Georgia -- why make it a crime. The question I asked to Senator Sullivan, why make it a crime to give people water while they're waiting in line to vote? I mean, what's the political strategy here? RAMESH PONNURU, BLOOMBERG OPINION COLUMNIST:  So that's clearly the provision of the law that has aroused the most outrage, and it seems to be designed to mimic parts of other states' codes where they're trying to prevent electioneering going in the voting booth or near the voting booth. It was not a particularly well-drafted section of this law, but the fundamental issue here I think is -- it's not whether we're bringing food and water to people in these long lines. It's why are we having these long lines in the first place? And the Georgia law does take some steps to shorten those lines. It increases the amount of absentee voting, the number of hours, the number of days that you can do absentee voting, for example, and that is where I think our focus ought to be. KARL:  So, Leah, I mean, you heard the terms Senator Warnock is talking about this. He basically makes it sound like it's, you know, a challenge to our democracy. How -- what makes this Georgia law so bad aside from the water? LEAH WRIGHT-RIGUEUR, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I mean, aside from the water? KARL:  Yeah, that's bad. OK, I’m going to buy that. But what is most objectionable here? WRIGHT-RIGUEUR:  The biggest part that we have to be thinking about is in a moment where we should be expanding democracy, a moment where we should be including more people in the democratic process, where we've seen what is possible, what is potential when we actually expand democracy for everyone, right? This constitutionally guaranteed right of voting, the most sacred of rights, of voting, we have this draconian law that's coming down and essentially saying, none for you, none for you, none for you. And I think it comes at the heels of an election that was transformative when we think about what happened in Georgia, turning Georgia blue, flipping Georgia blue, and then also when we see the two senators coming out of Georgia are now Democratic senators. The first time this has happened in over 30 years. So I think when we think about what is at stake here, we're thinking about democracy. We're thinking about the fundamental principles of democracy, and all of that is up for grabs right now, and I think it also sends a message I think to other states across the country about what could happen in terms of limiting democracy for all. KARL:  Rahm, but what is it that is the most objectionable here? RAHM EMANUEL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  What is the most objectionable? KARL:  Specifically. EMANUEL:  But it’s both political and policy. Look, I don't think America really became a fully democratic country until the Voting Rights Act, when everybody could participate. If you buy that principle, everything since Bush versus Gore, redistricting, dark money, restricting access to voting, I think all of that is about contracting and walking away. I think when you go back to Justice Roberts' decision that we -- striking Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. Those words are going to haunt, and that's exactly what happened, it opened up the floodgates where everybody basically walked away from the 1964 Civil Rights Act. This is about power. And I think when you go back to this access, which is both about access to the ballot, about making sure -- redistricting which is also part of HR-1, which is about making sure that the legislators do not actually design the districts. You put it in commission, and a lot of different Democratic and Republican states have done it, and then dark money. What you're doing is bringing integrity to the entire electoral process. Not just -- voting is important. The lines are important, and then money is important. And that is why HR-1 is right. MARGARET HOOVER, HOST, PBS “FIRING LINE:  Can I just say? Neither of our guests, respectfully, have been able to say specifically what's wrong with the Georgia law except for the 150-foot law and the water, which everybody admits is terrible optics. It gets rid of signature match. It expands early voting, it didn't think, God, get rid of the Souls to the Polls, the Sunday voting. It expanded Saturday and Sunday voting. This bill -- the Republicans who stood up to Donald Trump and argued against the big lie and said, nope, I’m not going to find 11,800 votes for you because that would be lying, and the undermining of the Constitution, those same people say, you know what? I might have written a better bill, but this is administrative changes codifying the things that expanded the franchise in this last election and putting them into law. EMANUEL:  Both of us were done respectfully as guests here. KARL: Yes. EMANUEL: They're all for guests. KARL: Yes. EMANUEL: But here's the thing, if Trump had won Georgia, you think they'd be doing this? It's a simple task (ph). Do you think if -- here's -- if Georgia was a -- HOOVER: That's fair, but what is so wrong with this particular law? EMANUEL: wait a second, wait a second, Georgia was the best, respectfully -- respectfully, do you think Georgia was the best performing Democratic state from -- it flipped from red to blue from 2016 to 2020, two Democratic senators and a pickup of a congressional seat. KARL: Well -- well, and -- EMANUEL: And the reason Georgia's the first out of the shoot and doing this is because it acted -- HOOVER: Because it's a big lie. Fair. EMANUEL: No -- right -- right. But if Trump had won, none of this would be going on. And so when you say, oh, there's nothing wrong with the -- the Georgia law is about restricting Democratic process, and that is what's -- every time America has achieved closer to its ideals, although never perfect, was about actually, from women voting, to people of color voting, to -- and making sure that people without -- KARL: It -- it -- WRIGHT-RIGUEUR: But we've been hearing -- EMANUEL: Without land could vote. It actually expanded the democratic process. This is restricting it. We've constantly -- KARL: Ramesh, go ahead. PONNURU: We've been hearing for years that Republicans are restricting voter access. There's a vote to (INAUDIBLE). And turnout just keeps getting higher. I think that one thing -- KARL: Well, we had record turnout now. PONNURU: Yes. KARL: And now you have all these efforts, which are more than what we've seen in the past. EMANUEL: Restrictive. KARL: And it -- and we are seeing -- and let me throw a couple things out there. It's, like, limiting the number of drop boxes and, you know, and these -- these are efforts we're seeing in several states. PONNURU: Georgia's going to have more drop box access than it had in 2019, right? I mean there is a -- a scale back from the pandemic circumstances, but this is not this draconian, restrictive law. HOOVER: And they wrote it into the statute for the first time. Like it had never even been legal in the statute to have these voting drop boxes. Now they've codified it. So while it is -- KARL: But -- but the whole effort -- and it's not just Georgia. We're -- we're seeing -- we're seeing several other states. HOOVER: Well, that's different. So -- so talking about Georgia, right -- KARL: But why -- why -- I mean what's the problem with drop boxes? The problem is that President Trump frankly said -- told lies about drop boxes. HOOVER: And -- and -- and you're right. KARL: (INAUDIBLE) -- HOOVER: Jonathan, you're right, there -- there absolutely is, on behalf -- and I'm never going to defend Republicans who want to restrict voting access. I believe more and more people should vote, and that is expanding franchise is, look, a successful party would just appeal to more voters, OK? That's what I want the Republican Party to do. KARL: Which is -- which is not what we're hearing across the country. HOOVER: Which is not what you're hearing universally. But the problem is, this issue is also so vitriolic, so hyperbolic that you can't actually have a conversation about the planks in the Georgia law without just going immediately to, they want all people to stop voting. EMANUEL: Yes, but you do have this -- you know, I think -- I -- the lawyer for the Republican National Committee said it in the Arizona case, politics is a zero sum game. And the motivation for having an opinion, and issuing an opinion on what's going on in Arizona was because if you had more people vote, they would lose. And so that's why I think when it also comes up to try to pass this in the Senate, you have three different sections. And the real question is, there's going to be a Republican that becomes the Senator Everett Dirksen of 1964 here that says, you know what, this is about America and about the Democratic process. Now, I think Republicans have a point on the integrity of the ballot, Democrats have a view about the voter access. That should be where the bond is built. And also getting to -- KARL: Is that -- is it possible to get to a bipartisan agreement on this? The question I was getting to Kate. And she says, well, ask the Republicans. But this is -- I mean you have these entirely partisan efforts in the states by Republicans, and then in Congress by the Democrats. I'm not equating the two efforts, but, I mean, if anything has to be bipartisan, it's -- it's how we conduct our elections. WRIGHT-RIGUEUR: (INAUDIBLE). It should absolutely be how we conduct our elections. And I think there is an opportunity right here that's in Congress right now, in front of people, to talk about this kind of bipartisan effort to expand the franchise, to make the franchise equitable and fair for everyone, to make it more exclusive, to make this about big party, big tent politics as opposed to restrictive. So we do see that. And I do -- you know, one of the things that I'm -- that I'm heartened by is that even as we argue over the semantics of what's going on in Georgia, there is an increasing recognition that the end of the Voting Rights Act, the gutting of the Voting Rights Act was a terrible decision, right? And that, in fact, there has to be some way to rectify this and it has to be something that has to be bipartisan, and it has to be something that comes at a federal level. Like, it can't be state and local. KARL: Same question to you, Ramesh. PONNURU: Well, one bipartisan initiative is voter ID requirements. Pew found that 76 percent of Americans, including a majority of Democrats, supports voter ID requirements. Now, I think that should be coupled with efforts to make it possible for anybody whose having trouble getting voter ID to get it. And Georgia does offers voter ID for free for people. But that is something that Democrats have gotten dead set against. There's not much evidence -- KARL: You're not helping me try to figure out where we're going to get to a bipartisan agreement in Congress. HOOVER: H.R. 4. Here's where you're going to get to H.R. 4. First of all, like, H.R. 4, which is -- which is the legislative answer. It's a restoration of the voting rights and it's the answer to Shelby v. Holder, right? That is a more narrow restoration of the Voting Right Act, as Rahm said, that isn't this sort of gargantuan, you know, we're also going to fix dark money and politics and we're also going to do all these other things. If you -- and, also, are -- are -- do we need 50 votes or do we need 60 votes? I mean all of this is shaded by the debate about the filibuster. KARL: All right, well that's a whole nother question. HOOVER: And what the rules are going to be. KARL: We have to take a quick break. We have to take a quick break. Maybe we can get to that on the other side. More roundtable ahead. But up next, Dr. Ashish Jha joins us to talk about getting back to normal as COVID vaccines pick up. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) KARL:  Dr. Ashish Jha is standing by, ready to go.  We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  On December 8th, I indicated that I hoped to get 100 million shots in people's arms in my first 100 days.  Now today I'm setting a second goal, and that is we will by my 100th day in office have administered 200 million shots in people's arms.  That's right, 200 million shots in 100 days. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  President Biden's latest vaccine pledge. Let's talk about the rollout now with Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health. Dr. Jha, I just want to ask you some practical questions, now that so many of us are getting the vaccines. One that I'm hearing a lot is:  Once I am fully vaccinated, if I'm exposed to COVID-19, I am protected from getting sick myself, but can I infect somebody else? DR. ASHISH JHA, DEAN, BROWN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH:  Yes, good morning, Jon. Thanks so much for having me on. You know, what we know right now is, if you are exposed after full vaccination, you're very, very, very unlikely to get sick, and you're pretty unlikely to transmit it to others. I mean, that transmission data isn't foolproof yet, but all the evidence so far suggests that your likelihood of passing it on to somebody else is -- you know, it's probably down 80, 90 percent, compared if you weren't vaccinated. KARL:  OK, so let me ask you one really close to home, OK? If my in-laws, just hypothetically, were fully vaccinated, been through full dose, both doses, can -- and, you know, the rest of the family is, say, on the first dose, but not fully through, can we go and safely visit them? And are there any special precautions we need to take, or are we pretty safe in doing that? JHA:  Yes, I think you're pretty safe. As long as there's no one in your family, Jonathan, who is particularly high-risk, no one with a severe health problem, I think it is safe. And the CDC has come out and said as much. I think the bottom line that people have to know is that we're not going to get to zero risk. But, at that point, when people are fully vaccinated, mingling with a family that's not, there's really a very, very low risk that anything bad is going to happen. KARL:  So, let me ask you, then, about something that President Biden said a while back. He was talking about July 4, and, you know, obviously the goal of having much of the country vaccinated by then. And he invoked the idea that we'll be able to have small family gatherings, barbecues in the backyard, small gatherings, family. I mean, at that point, if we're really fully vaccinated, I mean, can't we be doing more than just having family over in the backyard? Aren't we looking at a wider opening? JHA:  So, I do think we're looking at a wider opening. I think the question is, will everything be safe? Will everything that we used to do in 2019 be safe? And my take is, even by July 4, my expectation is that some proportion of Americans will have chosen not to get vaccinated, so they're still going to be at risk. And we probably should avoid those sort of large indoor gatherings, where we know the virus tends to spread more efficiently. But, short of that, yes, I do think we can do a lot more. It's not just small family gatherings. We can friends over. We can have probably larger gatherings indoors, especially if everybody is vaccinated. KARL:  All right. Dr. Jha, thank you very much for joining us. Coming up:  Calls for gun control are back front and center following the back-to-back shootings in Atlanta and Boulder. But will anything get done this time? The roundtable returns. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEPH R. BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  What this isn't about is policy. It's about stopping sensible gun legislation which a vast majority of Americans support. And I have no illusions about what we’re up against, what we’re up against or how hard the task is in front of us, but I also have never seen a nation's conscience so shaken by what happened at Sandy Hook. I don't to need to wait another minute, let alone an hour to take common sense steps that will save the lives in the future. (END VIDEO CLIP) KARL:  There you have it. President Biden at the center of the gun debate for decades. Let's pick it up here with the roundtable. Rahm, what is your sense this time? I mean, is it -- where does this stand in the president's priority list? EMANUEL:  Oh, it's high. That's how I got to know Joe Biden when we passed the assault weapon ban. I was responsible for President Clinton and doing that, and the Brady Bill. Both of those. And I would say one thing that I think would slightly twist -- and that's for all of us discussing -- back then when we passed the two-crime pieces, Brady Bill, the assault weapon ban, we focused on the gun -- on the criminal, not the gun. Now we're focusing on the gun. I would go back to terrorists, no fly, no buy. Cannot happen. Two, you have a domestic violence record, which is 10 percent of all homicides in America, you're banned from buying a gun. You have a violent criminal record as a juvenile, you can’t buy a gun. You have a mental health issue, and the relationship and anything on violence, on mental health, you can't buy a gun. If you focus on the criminal piece, not access to the gun, Republicans then realize it's not about gun access which would have obviously Second Amendment issue, but the criminal element which is how Clinton focused on both Brady with the five-day waiting period for a criminal could -- background check, and the assault weapon which was also a gun of choice by gangs. KARL:  But that was about the gun. It was about the assault weapon. EMANUEL:  No. If you actually go back to the debate -- sorry, let -- KARL: But the effect was to ban assault-style weapons. It was for everybody. EMANUEL: But it was -- it was -- it was basically to make sure that gang members did not -- that was the problem then. And it was focused on the criminal element. If you want to pass it, and you've got to deal -- get Republican votes, no fly, no buy. KARL: OK. So -- EMANUEL: You prove an old mental -- HOOVER: It sounds like you're saying -- it sounds like you're saying guns don't kill people, people kill people. EMANUEL: No, but I'm saying that if you go back to the debate -- HOOVER: No, no, no. I understand what you're saying, it's just that was the NRA tag line for so long. EMANUEL: Yes, no, I'll tell you -- and I -- I -- no, it's not. I mean, trust me, no friend there. It's very specifically -- HOOVER: And they're essentially gone now. (INAUDIBLE) different now. EMANUEL: But given -- given that you're never -- your -- Republicans are not going to vote for this. You have to get the access. The debate back in the '90s, the last time we passed it, was on the criminal element. That's where the debate should be. (INAUDIBLE). KARL: OK, so -- so -- obviously what's -- what's -- EMANUEL: And I want to be clear, Proud Boys are on a domestic terrorist list. KARL: What -- what's driving it here, though, is -- are -- are the mass shootings. And -- and, Ramesh, I want to put up this -- this list of some of the -- the most high profile mass shootings we have seen over the last several years. You know, Boulder, Midland-Odessa, Dayton, on through Parkland, Las Vegas, Orlando, Aurora, Sandy Hook. Each one of those, the gun used by the mass murderer was an AR-15. Why -- why shouldn't banning that weapon be on -- on the table? PONNURU: Well, I think that it is going to be very hard to get any kind of bipartisan consensus on that. I think some of the ideas that Rahm Emanuel was talking about might have some legs. But this is an idea, banning assault weapons, that got 39 votes in the Senate the last time it was voted on. A Democratic Senate in 2013, a Senate with more Democrats than the current Senate has. I think most people don't believe that a ban on assault weapons is going to do a lot to change the homicide rates in our country. We've got something like 15 million of them already in circulation. So I think there's a practical question as to whether this is going to actually achieve anything. And I think that other things, like, for example, as -- as Rahm was saying, talking about people with mental illness, particularly severe mental illness, people who have histories of abuse, that kind of more granular approach, I think, makes more sense. EMANUEL: We -- WRIGHT-RIGUEUR: Yes. So I was also going to say that I think there are two other issues that we have to address, which is that in addition to these mass shootings, which generate the most attention, we also know that we have a crisis of individual or micro-level homicides, shootings, suicides that are prevalent throughout the country and so there has to be -- KARL: And actually kill many more people. WRIGHT-RIGUEUR: And kill many more people. And so not only do we have to have -- draw attention to that, we also have to have the science that backs this up. The other thing right now is that right now states -- the majority of states can't even control, I think, on a local level how they want to do their own laws and legislations, in part because of obstructionism by various lobbying groups and organizations and things of that nature. So we have to figure out ways to give states power -- give -- and I can't believe I'm making what -- what sounds like a local control argument. KARL: States' rights. WRIGHT-RIGUEUR: Why? Republican -- yes, right, Republicans are really happy about that. EMANUEL: It's liberating. WRIGHT-RIGUEUR: But -- but we have to give states' power back to make local control laws and regulations so that if they want to, like in the case of Colorado, in the case of Boulder, for example, if they want to pass legislation, they can do that and have the freedom to do that. KARL: All right. Unfortunately, Rahm, I see your shaking your head, but we are out of time. EMANUEL: That is true (ph). KARL: That is all for us today. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Check out WORLD NEWS TONIGHT and have a great day. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",3
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kate-bedingfield-calls-migrant-surge-cyclical-issue/story?id=76725635,politics,"White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield dismissed the record surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S./Mexico border as a ""cyclical issue"" and denied that it is worse than any other time in history. ""These are the same kind of surges that we've seen,"" Bedingfield told ABC's ""This Week"" co-anchor Jonathan Karl on Sunday. ""They're not the result of one administration's policies or another administration's policies. They're the result of, for example, weather disasters in the region. They're the result of people fleeing poverty and violence."" A Border Patrol official   that in the past month, they've stopped an average of 5,000 people a day and are expecting that number to grow as the summer months near. As of Thursday, 18,046 unaccompanied minors were in the custody of Customs and Border Protection and Health and Human Services, skyrocketing by nearly 1,000 compared to the previous day. Bedingfield said Sunday that the administration is working to speed up the amount of time children are being held in CBP custody, because many are spending longer than the legally allowed 72 hours inside the cramped, temporary facilities. Images released by CBP last week   at a facility in Donna, Texas. Children are sleeping on gym mats, huddled under foil blankets and separated by plastic. It's only supposed to hold 250 people, but there are thousands inside. The White House has not granted media access to these detention-like facilities. ""The president is working as quickly as possible to move them into facilities that are acceptable,"" Bedingfield told Karl, adding that the administration has opened up space at Fort Bliss and Lackland Air Force Base to house unaccompanied minors. ""It's a temporary solution. Ultimately, what we need to do is address the root causes of migration,"" she added. The administration is struggling to balance its message that the U.S.-Mexico border is ""closed,"" while also openly acknowledging that they will not turn away children who arrive alone. But Bedingfield reinforced to Karl that the White House's message has ""been very clear"" that the border is not open. ""This is not the moment to do it. This is not the time to do it. The border is closed,"" she said. A new   released Sunday morning shows that 57% of Americans disapprove of the president's approach to the surge of migrants. Republicans have seized on this moment to criticize the administration and a large delegation of U.S. senators   this past week, characterizing the situation as a crisis. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, was part of the Republican delegation and told Karl in a separate interview on ""This Week"" that what he saw was ""shocking"" and ""heartbreaking."" ""I've been calling for, in a respectful way, I try to work in a bipartisan way, is for the president, for the vice president, to come down and to see what we saw, to hear what we heard from officials who are on the front lines,"" he said. GOP lawmakers aren't alone -- the   also found 54% of Americans view this as a crisis and another 42% believe it's a serious problem, but not a crisis. Bedingfield told Karl that this is an area where both Republicans and Democrats have historically shared a desire to work together and that ""this is a moment for Republicans to come to the table, to work with us on comprehensive immigration reform."" Another battle the White House is facing comes from Georgia, the state that delivered Democrats control of the Senate. Gov. Brian Kemp   a new election law that limits ballot drop boxes, adds new requirements for mail-in voting and makes it a crime for anyone other than a poll worker to offer food and water to voters waiting in line. On Friday, Biden called the new law ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century,"" "" ,"" and ""un-American."" ""The idea that you need to suppress the vote or prevent people in this country from voting in order to win, I mean, it truly runs counter to everything that we believe as Americans,"" Bedingfield told Karl Sunday. Biden said on Friday that his administration is working to figure out how to respond -- with the Department of Justice reviewing the law as well -- but ""don't know quite exactly what we can do at this point."" Bedingfield reiterated the administration's support for the House-passed   and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, but pressed by Karl if Biden has a way to bring Senate Republicans around on these bills, Bedingfield said ""that's a question best left to them."" ""Are they going to look their constituents in the eye and say, 'I spent my time in Washington trying to make it harder for you to cast your vote?'"" Bedingfield said. ""Is that really the argument that they want to take back to their constituents?""",3
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/patrolling-rio-grande-migrant-crossings-reporters-notebook/story?id=76725190,politics,"I was out with Texas State troopers onboard a tactical marine boat as they patrolled the Rio Grande on Friday. Staff Lt. Ivan Tijerina told me and those I was with that the troopers haven't seen a surge in migrants like the one underway now in years and, notably, he's never seen so many unaccompanied minors crossing the border. ""We've seen everything from empty one-gallon jugs made into makeshift rafts to 55-gallon drums. They make them into makeshift rafts -- mattresses, you name it. Whatever can float,"" he said. Crossing the river is perilous and sometimes deadly. In 2019, a viral photo of father Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his toddler daughter Valeria lying face down after drowning in the Rio Grande highlighted the risk migrants take. On March 20, a U.S. Border Patrol Marine Unit was flagged down to help three unresponsive migrants stranded on an island in the Rio Grande. The Guatemalan woman and her 3-year-old son, a Mexican national, survived. But her 9-year-old daughter, also a Mexican national, later died. On the Rio Grande, I spotted several makeshift rafts tangled in trees along the edge of the river -- troopers hopped on and off, puncturing the rafts so they couldn't be used again. According to the Missing Migrants Project, 76 migrants have died at the U.S.-Mexico border so far this year. The organization, which tracks deaths of migrants who have gone missing along mixed migration routes worldwide, also reports the top causes of migrant deaths along the border in 2020 include being shot and killed, vehicle accidents and drowning. ""A lot of times smugglers, they're called coyotes -- will bring them to the river and then say 'OK from here, that's it.' It's on your own, you cross and then leave them out here,"" Tijerina said. ""It becomes dangerous for them because they don't know that terrain. Terrain like this is very thick and vegetation, people can get lost and get hurt. You got venomous snakes, you have, you know, animals, and once they get hurt. It's very hard for somebody to get help."" In the past 30 days,   authorities at the southern border have stopped an average of 5,000 unauthorized immigrants a day, about half of whom are family members and unaccompanied minors, according to a senior Border Patrol official. But with the surge in migrants, Tijerina told us some are easily finding a way around authorities. ""One of our main challenges, we'll have some marine units out along areas on the river. The water's too shallow where we cannot patrol, and of course those areas are easily exploited because we can't reach there and depends on the accessibility of the land. That's easy to be exploited and used for human trafficking, as well as narcotics trafficking,"" Tijerina said. While we were out on the water, troopers spotted a car with its doors open -- a sign of an imminent crossing. By the time they doubled back, the car left to find another spot on the river that was not as well covered.",0
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bipartisanship-key-successful-voting-reform-gop-sen-dan/story?id=76725701,politics,"Bipartisan efforts are the key to successful voting rights reform, Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week,"" as hopes for reaching across the aisle in Congress falter and calls for removing the filibuster grow louder. ""I think it's really important to have this discussion on voting rights, on voting integrity, on access to the ballot,"" Sullivan told ""This Week"" co-anchor Jonathan Karl. But Sullivan said a bipartisan conversation surrounding voting rights is difficult right now because when someone in Congress has opposed H.R. 1, the Democrats' bill on the issue, it turns into ""an accusation that somehow we're supporting Jim Crow-like policies."" ""It doesn't help advance the issue. It doesn't help bring unity. It doesn't help bring a bipartisan nature to this,"" he continued. Pushing the   -- which seeks to abolish hurdles to voting, reform the role of money in politics and tighten federal ethics rules -- congressional Democrats are trying to   in Republican-led state legislatures to   in the name of security after many in the GOP, led by former President Donald Trump, pushed false election theories following the 2020 election. In Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp signed a bill Thursday that will make sweeping changes to election law, impacting voters, local election administrators and the board overseeing elections. Karl pressed Sullivan on the efforts in 43 states to restrict access to the ballot. ""Why is it that Republicans seem to believe, at this moment in time, that they want fewer people to vote -- that the right thing to do is to have fewer people voting in our elections?"" he asked. Sullivan dodged Karl's question, but said that it is unusual for federal voting reform to become an issue of contention, given that the administration of elections is historically left to the states. ""When you look at the history in our country, individual voting issues in states is not normally the reason -- the impetus -- to bring major bipartisan national federal legislation, unless there is strong bipartisan support for this,"" he said. ""And so I think that's the key issue in right now, H.R.1, the Pelosi bill from the House, not only doesn't have support from Republicans, it doesn't have support from many Democrats. So again the key issue here is to work on this issue in a bipartisan nature."" Sullivan said immigration reform is another issue which warrants bipartisan negotiation and responded to   the crisis at the southern border by White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield, who said in an earlier interview on ""This Week"" that Biden has made clear the borders are closed for the time being. Following a recent trip to the southern border with much of the Senate GOP conference, he said President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris need to go and ""see what we saw, to hear what we heard from officials who are on the front lines."" ""But right now it is open borders,"" Sullivan said. ""It's a humanitarian, and public health crisis that we need to address."" Karl also asked the senator about the fallout from the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, as federal authorities continue to prosecute those who took part in that violence by storming the building. Trump recently said that he felt those in attendance were being ""persecuted."" ""Is this DOJ effort to charge the people that went into the Capitol, is that -- is that persecution or is that rightful prosecution?"" he asked. Sullivan disagreed with the characterization from the former president, but said that he believes it is important that those who were in attendance and were peaceful not have their reputations ""tarnished."" ""Here's the key issue, and it's a really important distinction: The people who committed violence -- and I condemned that violence from the minute it started happening -- should be fully prosecuted,"" Sullivan said. ""I think the vast majority of Americans, Democrats and Republicans, fully agree with that, no doubt about it."" The violence that day ultimately led to the House of Representatives pursuing a charge of incitement of insurrection against Trump, which led to the most bipartisan impeachment vote in history. The measure failed in the Senate, but Sullivan's home state colleague, moderate Sen. Lisa Murkowski, voted to impeach the president. Her vote led to a censure at home by the Alaska GOP and a vow from Trump and the state party that they would   when she up for reelection next year. Sullivan said he will support her when she is on the ballot again. ""Sen. Murkowski was a strong supporter of mine and we won that reelection, very strongly,"" Sullivan said of his campaign last year. ""Look we don't agree on everything, but we make a good team for Alaska,"" he added. ""If Sen. Murkowski runs again, I'm going to support her.""",3
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cdc-extends-eviction-moratorium-late-june/story?id=76751761,politics,"Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has signed an extension on the agency's moratorium on evictions through June 30, further preventing the eviction of tenants who are unable to make rental payments, the   Monday. The order was set to end March 31, but the CDC's move gives renters 90 more days of relief it in the interest of public   amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the second time that Walensky has extended the order to stop evictions during the pandemic. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a historic threat to the nation’s public health,"" Walenskey said in a statement. ""Keeping people in their homes and out of crowded or congregate settings — like homeless shelters — by preventing evictions is a key step in helping to stop the spread of COVID-19."" The CDC previously cited outbreaks in homeless shelters as cautionary tales about the danger the communal spaces can pose during the pandemic. The CDC also previously cited data from the Census Bureau's   that said that 32% of renters indicated they would move in with family or friends if evicted, which could pose spread within households. The Department of Housing and Urban Development also extended a moratorium on evictions in federally assisted housing until June 30. Secretary for Housing and Urban Development Marcia Fudge discussed the move in a White House press briefing last week. ""Many of the people living in federally-assisted housing have risk factors that make them particularly vulnerable to COVID. These factors include disability, race, and low-income, along with racial and ethnic disparities in access to response, care, and treatment. We’re making sure that federal, state, and local efforts to reach those most at-risk of COVID are linking those efforts to people living in housing HUD supports,"" Fudge said. ""The American Rescue Plan is critical to our success in these efforts."" Fudge discussed the rates of homelessness on  , which a report by HUD found were up 2% in 2020, a statistic that does not reflect the impact of the pandemic. ""I'm not going to try to sugarcoat it. I mean, when we have people who are literally living on the streets, in those numbers, in an extraordinary circumstance, such as COVID, we know that it's going to get worse. What we're trying to do now is make sure that we can cut it off before it gets any worse. That is why it is so significant that we can help cities and communities find housing for people who are most at risk of contracting COVID in the first place."" Funds in the president's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package allocated more than $21 billion in assistance to renters. White House press secretary Jen Psaki discussed the move during a press briefing Monday and discussed rental assistance funds. ""The president is committed to supporting renters and small landlords through the COVID-19 crisis, essential to that effort is of course the American Rescue Plan, which delivers an additional $21.5 billion in emergency rental assistance to help millions of families keep up on rent and remain in their homes,"" Psaki said.",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/york-city-moves-end-qualified-immunity-making-1st/story?id=76752098,politics,"The city of New York moved to end qualified immunity, making it the first city in the United States to do so. Qualified immunity is the practice of not being able to file a civil lawsuit against a government official performing his or her official duties unless they ""clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known."" In New York, the City Council voted to end the practice for   officers. The NYPD is the   in the United States, with some 36,000 officers. The move came days ahead of the start of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's  . The   while in police custody sparked international protests and a debate over policing reform across the U.S. last summer. In an interview on WNYC's ""The Brian Lehrer Show,"" Mayor Bill DeBlasio stressed that the bill won't have officers personally responsible. ""It makes it easier if someone has a concern to bring a legal action, but it does not put the individual financial penalty on the officer,"" the mayor said. ""It puts it on the department and the city, and that's what I was comfortable with."" City Council speaker Corey Johnson lauded the move saying that the practice of qualified immunity   the nation's systemic racism. ""Qualified immunity was established in 1967 in Mississippi to prevent Freedom Riders from holding public officials liable even when they broke the law,"" Johnson tweeted. ""Rooted in our nation's history of systemic racism, qualified immunity denied Freedom Riders justice and has been used to deny justice to victims of police abuse for decades. It should never have been allowed, but I'm proud that we took action today to end it here in NYC."" Police union officials are speaking out against the law, which the mayor signaled he intended to sign. ""Qualified immunity is an essential part of the law enforcement profession. While it shields officers from erroneous and professionally damaging lawsuits, it does not erase responsibility. At any point in time, an agency determines the office was acting out of policy or unlawfully, qualified immunity could be removed and them exposed to full liability,"" Don Mihalek, an ABC News contributor said. ""The public often confuses lawful actions by law enforcement versus public perception. What is lawful may not be clear in the public's view. This is why an investigation is paramount to document the lawfulness of an officer's actions,"" said Mihalek, who also serves as the executive director of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association.",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/targeted-violence-schools-preventable-secret-service-report/story?id=76755511,politics,"Targeted violence against schools is preventable, if the warning signs are identified, according to a new report by the Secret Service released Tuesday. The report by the Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center studied 67 thwarted school violence plots and 100 plotters to come up with a framework to further  . The agency found that there were   in attacks that were prevented and attacks that happened, such as a history of discipline or law enforcement interaction, if the plotter had experienced bullying or had underlying mental health issues, intended to commit suicide or had been impacted by childhood conditions. Schools should intervene as quickly as possible, according to the Secret Service. Dr. Lina Althari, director of the Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center, told ABC News that identifying warning signs of a student who could potentially carry out a mass attack is crucial in getting the student help. ""We want to make sure that we are identifying these kids before it gets to the level where they are engaging in criminal actions, and then face legal consequences for that,"" she said. ""We want to make sure we're catching them early on when maybe they are becoming more depressed, they are becoming more suicidal."" The Secret Service found that 45% of the attacks planned, but not carried out, were based on a grievance with a classmate. It also found that 15% of potential attackers wanted to kill. For example, according to authorities Matthew Vanderbeek threatened to shoot up his graduation ceremony in 2018. Vanderbeek wanted to emulate the 2012 Aurora, Colorado,   that killed 12, according to the Secret Service, even going so far as dyeing his hair to match that of the convicted gunman and advocating for his release from prison. Students are best positioned to report any concerning behavior of a classmate, the report said, but families are critical to identifying troubling behavior. In the foiled plots studied by the Secret Service, 69% of the communications about the plans were observed by students, classmates or peers. Often times, when reported early, student plotters are able to seek treatment rather than criminal prosecution, Althari said. ""Sometimes we know parents can be in denial,"" Althari said. ""But if it is swiftly explained to them what the goal of this process is which is about helping that student have successful outcomes in life."" The report also found that 64% of the student attack plotters had access to firearms and 15 of the foiled plots were set to be conducted on dates in April -- likely because of the Columbine High School shooting, which occurred on  . The Secret Service found that in nearly half of the planned plots, one or more of the co-conspirators had interest in the 1998 shooting at Columbine. And of the school attackers who planned but did not carry out the attack, 85% either researched how to obtain or obtained weapons. And in nearly all of the attacks, the plotter planned to use firearms in the attack itself and 51% had planned to use explosives. The report indicated that 75% of the plotters were discovered because they communicated their intent and most behaviors were observed and reported on the same day. In one instance, a 17-year-old male was reported to police by a friend after he indicated he wanted to carry out a school shooting. ""The plotter created cellphone videos in which he discussed his plot, stating he would kill more people than Columbine, Virginia Tech or the attack in Oslo, Norway,"" the report says. ""The plotter spoke about purchasing an AK-17 with a laser sight, told him that he perfected a timer for bombs and showed him a map of schools."" A majority of the plotters were also male, which is consistent with previous Secret Service research on mass attacks.",0

So perhaps it's fitting that   are now fundamental to a presidential agenda. President Joe Biden is signaling that he's ready for the fight. But the issue is playing out in a particularly polarized way -- in entirely different directions at the federal level and inside states, depending on which party is in power -- that could easily jeopardize the rest of his agenda. Now that the president has called the   both ""un-American"" and ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century,"" there may be no avoiding what comes next. Even as Republicans debate new restrictions in Arizona, Florida, Texas and elsewhere, Democrats face pressure inside their own ranks to act boldly at the federal level in a much different direction. For now, Democrats see the GOP's   as racist attempts to buttress   lies told by former President Donald Trump. Republicans cast the   in Congress as self-serving and expensive attempts to federalize elections. When both parties say the other side is engaged in a ""power grab,"" it's hard to even think about middle ground. States are passing more restrictive voting-access measures without Democratic support and Biden and congressional leaders are backing more expansive measures without Republican support -- and may go so far as to blow up Senate rules to pass it. Biden, of course, needs a   to advance initiatives on immigration, gun control and virtually everything else on the agenda. He surely doesn't want the   to be "" .""  of Derek Chauvin  , bringing a renewed focus on police reform. Chauvin is the fired Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in the death of George Floyd. Chauvin was caught on camera kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes while Floyd begged for his life. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, spurred by   in his memory, would establish a national standard for the operation of police departments, aims to streamline federal law to allow for the prosecution of excessive force, mandates that independent prosecutors handle police investigations, establishes data collection on police encounters and redirects funds to invest in transformative community-based policing programs. It would also ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants, and would require that police only use deadly force as a last resort after trying de-escalation tactics. An identical bill passed the House in 2020 but languished in the Republican-led Senate. The legislation   220-212 without Republican support earlier this month and this time around Democrats have the majority. But the future is murky in the evenly divided Senate because a 60-vote requirement means that Democrats will need to entice 10 Republicans, many of whom are staunchly opposed. The   could also stamp out the attempt to address the outcry of thousands of protesters across the country who have called for transformative change in policing. Not even two months into his tenure as the head of the Michigan Republican Party, Ron Weiser is under fire. After calling three high-ranking female Democratic leaders in the state ""witches"" who should be ""ready for the burning at the stake,"" and mentioning ""assassination"" as a possible scenario to oust two Republican lawmakers who voted to impeach Trump, he issued an apology. ""In an increasingly vitriolic political environment, we should all do better to treat each other with respect, myself included. I fell short of that the other night. I apologize to those I offended for the flippant analogy about three women who are elected officials and for the off-hand comments about two other leaders,"" he said in a statement released Saturday. ""I have never advocated for violence and never will."" For the three women he targeted -- Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson -- Weiser went too far. And his attempt to walk back his controversial comments was seen as a ""half-apology"" that  , particularly in a state that has seen   directed at its elected officials over the last four years. For Whitmer, in particular, Weiser's rhetoric is ""destructive and downright dangerous,"" as a spokesperson for the governor put it. But it's also not the first time Republicans have put her in their crosshairs. As one of the most visible leaders during the coronavirus crisis, she was a favorite mark for Trump and, in turn, became a target of the right and of a thwarted kidnapping plot last year. As he confronts a set of concurrent challenges, President Joe Biden receives high marks on his top priorities -- the coronavirus pandemic and the economic recovery. Still, there are warning signs for other areas of his agenda where external events have imposed new urgency, a new   finds.

They  ; now, many are looking to him to return the favor. ""We've given him what he asked for, so now it is time for us to receive that in return,"" said Quati Woodberry-Gadson of North Charleston. ""Yes,   is an issue, but so is housing, so is health care, so are all of these things that we have been voting for and have been striving to achieve and accomplish."" Biden has surpassed two months in the White House and   returned to the state that helped reinvigorate his faltering 2020 campaign to hear directly from voters about where he is meeting expectations, where he may be missing the mark and their feelings about the direction of the country in the post-Donald Trump era. ""We're still worried about the variants and things like that, but for us it's the hope that we see in the vaccine rolling out,"" said Marybeth Berry, a university professor and mother of two from Columbia, who broadly praised Biden's handling of the pandemic. ""He came in with a plan,"" added retired Army Maj. Christopher Berry, a lifelong Republican, ""and he's letting the medical community -- more or less,   -- be the mouthpiece instead of him getting up in front of everybody trying to convince them what's real and what's not so."" Nationwide, voters of both parties have  of Biden's handling of the pandemic and plan to bolster the economy. But there are signs that many Americans -- including loyal Democrats -- harbor misgivings about the administration's early approach to immigration and gun violence. ""The crisis at the border is very concerning to me,"" said Marybeth Berry, a Democrat who voted for Biden. ""The kids in cages -- I was appalled at that during the Trump administration. ... And now to see it happening even more so with this influx of children at the border, that is concerning."" ""It's not a crisis,"" said Felisha Woodberry, a longtime Sen.   supporter in North Charleston, ""but I feel like they should have had a plan ready to go from day one to put in place for those people who were here and those who were coming."" Mayor Michael Butler of Orangeburg, a heavily African American community that is a must-visit on the road to the White House for Democrats, even volunteered that the southern border situation is a source of disappointment in the new president. ""I know we want to help everyone, but we still have to have standards for people to go through the immigration process,"" Butler said of the administration's approach to a surge in migrants from Central America. Biden won the Democratic primary in South Carolina with 48.6% of the vote, overwhelmingly defeating his next closest competitor, Sanders, who captured just 19.8%. The state's African American voters powered his victory with nearly two-thirds backing the former vice president. ""He's presidential. He's given us someone to look up to and say this is our leader, he and his family,"" said Butler, the first black mayor in Orangeburg history. He initially supported New York City Mayor   in the Democratic primary but now calls Biden a ""savior."" ""We needed someone to take us through the Red Sea and he's the one leading us across,"" he said. ""I would tell him, 'President Biden, continue doing what you're doing; build on principles and things that you've stood for; and make America become greater.'"" While many South Carolina Democrats praised Biden for his decency and measured tone, some told ABC News they are still waiting to see bold action that was promised during the campaign. ""We need to act -- not tomorrow, not a year from now, but today,"" said Lawrence Nathaniel, a once-homeless son of Columbia who founded   South Carolina   of George Floyd in May. ""Right now we're   on the Senate, and making sure that we can get the   passed through,"" Nathaniel said. ""We want the president and vice president to put a little more focus on it and not make it just a ceremonial thing."" Nathaniel, who supported businessman   in the primary, said he's cautiously optimistic Biden shares his urgency for change but is not convinced. ""There are people out here that are still hurting and that need help and need to be sure they can trust you as president of the United States,"" he said of his message to the president. Nina Grey, a 77-year-old retired minister and progressive activist, said she takes Biden at his word but that voters like her need to keep up pressure for action. ""You have to help him by expressing your point of view. I think everybody needs to do that, and we all need to find our citizenship voice and engage,"" Grey said in an interview at her Columbia home. ""I think he can deliver quite a bit."" At Biden's first campaign rally in South Carolina in 2019,   to end longtime support for a ban on federal funding for abortions and he agreed. Her exchange with the candidate, captured on cellphone video, was the first time Biden publicly changed his position on the issue. ""Of course his Catholic faith is against that, but I have also seen him evolve,"" Grey said. Marybeth Berry questioned Biden at a campaign event days before the primary vote in 2020 -- a town hall moment that went viral on social media -- asking the candidate to display more ""fire"" in his approach. Berry said that so far she's getting what she hoped for. ""You know there's always still a little politician stuff that, you know, you sort of wish wouldn't happen, but overall I think that he's -- he seems to be honest, and I mean he's getting things done,"" she said. In North Charleston, where the pandemic and recession have exacerbated financial and education inequality, Felisha Woodberry, an unemployment claims processor and mother of two, said she still  . ""I'm OK with what (Biden is) putting in place,"" Woodberry said. ""Bernie was the person that I felt like had a plan to hit the road. And I feel like with Joe Biden, what's happened more so is that everybody's so concerned with what's happening with COVID and what needs to happen with COVID that everything else is pushed back."" Her daughter, Quati Woodberry-Gadson, is spending her final weeks in college on an internship with local nonprofit  , which is bridging gaps in government support for families. ""Now that the pandemic has hit and is in full swing, it has really highlighted the necessity, as far as what kids are missing and lacking,"" said Woodberry-Gadson, who helps stockpile food, clothing and hygiene products for children at a local school. ""If there was some kind of way that (President Biden) could make it to South Carolina to actually see the disparities and the poverty rate and everything that's needed and necessary, I feel like it would be monumental to my community and to the people who I'm advocating for,"" she said. Biden has not yet returned to South Carolina as president, but has spent extensive time in the state during his career. In 2015, after a white supremacist   at a bible study at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, then-Vice President Biden consoled the victims' families and worshipped with them out of the public spotlight. ""Faith that is not accompanied by action is dead,"" said  , who's wife Myra was among those killed in the church shooting. ""In Biden, faith is certainly not dead."" ""He just passed the   into law, and that's faith,"" Thompson added, ""because he's answering the needs of the people."" Thompson and his son, Anthony Thompson, Jr., said they were deeply moved by Biden's compassion after the massacre and are convinced he has the ability to bridge political divides. ""When we talk about criminal justice reform, you know, I think these are areas that are important to particularly the African American community,"" Thompson, Jr., said. ""And so for him coming out already for addressing those issues, I think that's very important and speaks to his leadership."" Days before the Thompsons spoke with ABC News, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a   that would strengthen gun-safety regulations and close the so-called Charleston background check loophole. The measure faces strong opposition from Republicans in the Senate. ""When they were checking   record, if they had just a lot more days, then my wife would still be here,"" the reverend said of the man who killed his wife with a gun obtained after a delay in his background check. ""One day it could be your family. Maybe your child, your wife, your best friend. You know, you just don't know how I feel, until it happens to you,"" he said. ""So why wait for it to happen to you or anybody close to you before you decide to do something about it."" As he reflected on divisions in American society and the challenges ahead in Biden's presidency, Thompson -- who has   his wife's killer -- said his prayer is that the idea of forgiveness will spread within our politics. ""People are trying to find a way to get peace from their burdens, and they just don't know how to do it, what to do. They think anger is going to be the thing to do it; revenge will be the thing to do it; but it never happens, just gets worse. That's what's happened to our country,"" Thompson said. ""We as people, as a nation, have to get past all the things that happened in the past, like slavery, like racism, discrimination, segregation. You got to begin in your family. Your family takes it, and it just spreads.""",3
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/accused-drug-trafficking-honduran-president-critical-challenge-bidens/story?id=76678729,politics,"Vice President Kamala Harris will begin calling leaders from Central America this week as she takes the lead for the Biden administration on tackling a surge in migration to the southern U.S. border. But one of those calls will be particularly delicate because she'll be talking to a head of state who acts more like a narcotrafficker, U.S. prosecutors in New York have alleged. President Juan Orlando Hernandez of Honduras has been cast as a co-conspirator in a federal drug trafficking trial this month. His associate, now a convicted drug kingpin, has alleged that Hernandez accepted millions of dollars in bribes and helped protect a flood of cocaine into the U.S. Hernandez has not been charged and denied the allegations, even distorting State Department data about drug trafficking in his country to claim, ""HUGE SUCCESS!"" Many of the migrants reaching the southern U.S. border are fleeing violence, drugs and corruption in Honduras under Hernandez's watch. In light of the allegations against him, there is growing pressure on the Biden administration to change its approach to Hernandez, who claimed victory in a close 2017 re-election race that was marred by allegations of fraud -- but for which he received U.S. backing from the Trump administration. A State Department spokesperson told ABC News that the Biden administration is dedicated ""to fighting corruption in Honduras and we will support and work with leaders who are committed to these same goals."" But they would not say whether Hernandez is such a leader, criticize him directly or say if the administration sees him as part of the problem. Instead, they added their commitment ""to work with partner governments who are ready to make the needed political, rule-of-law and economic reforms that are essential to success."" President Joe Biden has pledged a $4 billion, multi-year investment project in Central America's so-called ""Northern Triangle"" -- Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. The majority of migrants to the U.S. border are from one of these three countries, traversing through their larger neighbor Mexico and fleeing high rates of violence and gang activity, few jobs or opportunities, and much insecurity. The investment is in its earliest stages and has not yet been appropriated by Congress, but the Biden administration may move quickly with some funding as it faces a record increase of unaccompanied minors crossing the U.S.-Mexican border. Harris will oversee an effort to not only stem the flow of migrants, according to the White House, but also establish a ""strategic partnership"" with Mexico and the Northern Triangle ""to enhance prosperity, combat corruption and strengthen the rule of law."" Given the allegations against him by U.S. prosecutors, some analysts say it is hard to see how Hernandez can be part of that. He has been repeatedly named in the trial of Honduran drug trafficker Geovanny Fuentes Ramirez this month. U.S. attorneys for the Southern District of New York alleged that he accepted bribes from Fuentes to facilitate tons of cocaine to the U.S. while a presidential candidate and leader of Honduras' congress in 2013. While appearing to cooperate with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, Hernandez reportedly vowed to tear up Honduras' extradition treaty with the U.S. and ""stuff drugs up the gringos' noses,"" prosecutors said. In addition to Fuentes, Hernandez's brother Tony Hernandez, also a Honduran congressman, was convicted in October 2019 of drug trafficking charges and lying to the Drug Enforcement Agency. He is scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday for up to life in prison. While the State Department declined to directly criticize Hernandez, it said none of Biden's $4 billion investment will go directly to governments in the region, including Hernandez's, but to civil society, religious organizations, international organizations and nongovernmental organizations. ""This is not a blank check,"" the department spokesperson added. ""Addressing the region's daunting challenges requires systemic change and political will from the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Combating corruption and impunity is at the center of our strategy for the region. Central America will never live up to its full potential without addressing endemic corruption."" But they would not say how they'll do that, especially with Hernandez in power -- except that they have ""robust"" ways to monitor how funds are spent and they ""will use all available tools, including visa restrictions, to promote accountability for corrupt actors."" Whether that extends to a head of government remains to be seen. While U.S. prosecutors have directly implicated Hernandez, charging him would be a highly unusual move to make against a foreign head of government. Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro was charged in March 2020 by the Justice Department for drug trafficking too, but the Trump administration no longer recognized him as Venezuelan president. Hernandez also said earlier this month that State Department data provides an ""instant rebuttal of the false narrative"" against him -- tweeting that his ""government dramatically lowered the drug rate from 87% to 4%... a reduction of 95.4%"" But that distorts data from the State Department's annual reports on international narcotics control. In 2013, it said that up to ""87 percent of all cocaine smuggling flights departing south America first land in Honduras,"" a key transit point for narcotrafficking because of how remote and ungoverned its north coast is. In the 2020 report, that number drop to 4%, but largely because ""more is assessed to have transited through Honduras by land after making a first arrival in other countries."" The State Department declined to comment on Hernandez's claim, but its 2020 narcotics report highlights cooperation with the Honduran government despite the prosecutors' allegations. ""The political will of the Honduran government to combat drug trafficking in coordination with U.S. law enforcement agencies continues,"" the report said. ""The Government of Honduras does not, as a matter of official government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs."" The problem runs much deeper than Hernandez, too. Yani Rosenthal, the front-runner to be one of the two major party's presidential nominee, was released from U.S. prison in August after serving three years for money laundering, while several other candidates in the country's primaries earlier this month were under investigation for corruption. Critically, one of the reasons Hernandez remains in power now is because of prior U.S. backing. After removing the country's limit of two presidential terms, Hernandez claimed victory in 2017 in a narrow contest that international election observers from the Organization of American States and the European Union said was fraudulent. The Trump administration, however, stood by Hernandez in the face of widespread protests and a bloody government response that left dozens dead. The State Department said there were ""irregularities identified by the OAS and the EU,"" but called for ""robust national dialogue ... to heal the political divide"" and congratulated Hernandez. Lawmakers back then opposed Trump's support for Hernandez, and this week, a group of Democrats have stepped forward to urge Biden to reconsider the U.S. partnership with Hernandez. Rep. Norma Torres, a leading U.S. lawmaker on Central American issues and a Guatemalan native, wrote to Biden's team this week to stop ""sending money to directly to the hands of corrupt officials"" like Hernandez. Last month, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., introduced a bill to impose sanctions on Hernandez and suspend U.S. security assistance and export licenses for certain defense-related items to the country.",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cdc-director-feels-sense-impending-doom-covid-19/story?id=76750417,politics,"CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, in an emotional plea Monday, said she feels a sense of ""impeding doom"" about   in COVID-19 cases as infections increased 10% and President Joe Biden called for a return of mask mandates. ""I'm going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom,"" Walensky said at a White House briefing. ""We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are, and so much reason for hope. But right now, I'm scared."" Walensky has   that the country would face another, avoidable surge in COVID-19 cases if Americans didn't keep wearing masks, avoid travel, and continue social distancing until more of the population is vaccinated. Not long after, Biden echoed her warning. ""I'm reiterating my call for every governor, mayor, and local leader to maintain and reinstate the mask mandate – please,"" Biden said at an event announcing more vaccine eligibility. ""This is not politics. Reinstate the mandate if you let it down. And businesses should require masks as well. The failure to take this virus seriously -- precisely what got us in this mess in the first place -- risks more cases and more desks -- deaths."" ""We're in the life-and-death race for the virus that is spreading quickly, with cases rising again, new variants are spreading,” he said. “And, sadly, some of the reckless behavior we have seen on television over the past few weeks means that more new cases are to come in the weeks ahead."" He said he thought some states should pause their reopening efforts. Walensky said the CDC is now seeing the number of new COVID-19 cases and people hospitalized with the disease increase, which she attributed to increased travel in recent weeks, lifting restrictions, and more relaxed behavior. The seven-day average of cases is slightly below 60,000 cases a day, a 10% increase over the previous period. Hospitalizations and deaths also have increased. Walensky said the CDC is investigating outbreaks at a local level in individual states. The largest increases have occurred in Michigan, Connecticut, North Dakota, New York, Iowa and Vermont. ""I think we are seeing that many of these states are opening up at levels that we wouldn't necessarily recommend. I am working with the governors. I will be speaking with them tomorrow to try and buckle down on trying to refrain from opening up too fast,"" she said. Walensky reflected on her experience treating COVID-19 patients over the last year, saying she has been the last person to sit with someone's loved one when they were dying and knows the stress on healthcare providers not sure if they'll have the resources to treat every patient. And she said with the vaccination effort underway the end of the pandemic is within reach, but she said until more Americans are vaccinated everyone has to continue wearing masks, refrain from nonessential travel, and take steps to prevent more people from becoming sick. She warned another COVID-19 surge along the lines of last summer or the winter would slow down efforts to vaccinate more people. ""We have come such a long way. Three historic scientific breakthrough  , and we are rolling them out so very fast. So I'm speaking today not necessarily as your CDC director or not only as your CDC director, but as a wife, as a mother, as a daughter, to ask you to just please hold on for a little while longer,"" she said. ""I so badly want to be done, I know you all so badly want to be done, we're just almost there, but not quite yet. And so I'm asking you to just hold on a little longer to get vaccinated when you can, so that all of those people that we all love was still be here when this pandemic ends,"" she said.",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/solarwinds-cyberhack-gained-access-acting-dhs-chiefs-emails/story?id=76766289,politics,"Authorities believe that the massive   allegedly carried out by Russia last year successfully breached the email accounts of then-DHS acting secretary Chad Wolf and dozens of other officials at the Department of Homeland Security, three sources familiar with the matter told ABC News. In fact, the email accounts of top officials at Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency -- the very DHS agency charged with fighting cyber threats -- may have been compromised by the cyberattack, according to one former government official familiar with the matter. In a statement, DHS acknowledges a ""small number"" of employees accounts were targeted in the breach, but there are no indicators that their networks are compromised as of now. ""A widespread intrusion campaign targeted many federal government and private sector entities, including DHS,"" according to a DHS spokesperson. ""Upon learning about the campaign, the Department took immediate steps to respond to the incident, including leveraging response teams from CISA and private sector partners, to continue executing its mission,"" the spokesperson said. ""However, this widespread intrusion campaign has again shown that our strategic adversaries are sophisticated, persistent, and have increasing capabilities.” The massive hack, discovered in December, affected nine federal agencies, according to Deputy National Security Adviser for cyber Anne Neuberger. Those responsible were ""likely of Russian origin,"" that the hack was ""launched from inside the United States” and that it could take ""several months"" to complete the investigation, she said at a press briefing in February. The administration has yet to outline what exactly their response will be to the hack. FBI Director Chris Wray, asked earlier this month by Senate Judiciary Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., what the U.S. government's response should be to the SolarWinds hack, said he didn't want to answer specifically because ""discussing the response in any detail is probably something that would be better done in a classified setting. That by itself might give you a little bit of a hint."" Wray said more generally that coming back from the SolarWinds hack would be a ""long, hard slog,"" even using the strategy that has been most effective for the U.S. in the past regarding countering cyber adversaries.",0
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/blinken-swipes-trump-administration-unveiling-human-rights-report/story?id=76770342,politics,"Secretary of State Antony Blinken repudiated the Trump administration's approach to human rights, with his most direct condemnation of his predecessor yet. Blinken launched the department's 45th annual human rights report Tuesday -- the gold standard in documenting abuses and atrocities in nearly 200 countries and territories around the world. The report, which covers 2020, found a further deterioration for human rights in many countries, particularly as governments used the   pandemic to curb their citizens' rights. The first report under the Biden administration also   that eliminated   of the Trump years, like ending former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's ""hierarchy"" of rights and re-introducing a section on women's reproductive rights that will be published later this year. When human rights defenders ""come under attack, they often look to the United States to speak up on their behalf. Too often in recent years, these defenders heard only silence from us,"" Blinken said. ""We are back for those brave advocates as well. We will not be silent."" In particular, Blinken ""decisively"" repudiated Pompeo's ""Unalienable Rights Commission,"" a panel of academics that said in a report last July that freedom of religion and right to property were the most important human rights. While Pompeo touted the report and said it would lay a foundation for future administrations, critics accused it of minimizing minority rights. Blinken essentially jettisoned the report, saying Tuesday, ""There is no hierarchy that makes some rights more important than others. Past unbalanced statements that suggest such a hierarchy, including those offered by a recently disbanded State Department advisory committee, do not represent a guiding document for this administration."" Human rights are increasingly under threat around the world, Blinken said, saying the trendlines ""are in the wrong direction."" In particular, he highlighted what he called the Chinese   of Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang province, attacks on civil society and   in Russia, Uganda and Venezuela and on pro-democracy protesters in Belarus,   in Yemen, atrocities ""credibly reported"" in Ethiopia's Tigray region, and abuses by the Syria's Bashar al-Assad's regime. While the report doesn't touch on Myanmar's coup and the military's bloody  , because they happened in 2021, Blinken took time to again condemn the events. But after weeks of steadily increasing U.S. sanctions that have not deterred the ruling junta, he had no specific answer on what else the U.S. could do to change the darkening trajectory there. Blinken also leaned into America's own human rights issues, particularly the moment of racial reckoning in the last year. Chinese officials and state-run outlets   U.S. race relations to say American officials are in no position to criticize Beijing -- comparing Uighur slave labor in Xinjiang to Black slaves in the U.S. South. ""We know we have work to do at home. That includes addressing profound inequities, including systemic racism. We don't pretend these problems don't exist. ... We deal with them in the daylight with full transparency, and in fact, that's exactly what separates our democracy and autocracies,"" he said, adding that open reckoning gives the U.S. ""greater legitimacy"" to address other countries' records, too. The Biden administration will use all tools available to impose consequences on human rights abusers and encourage better behavior, Blinken said,   Khashoggi policy that imposes visa restrictions on officials that target or harass their countries' dissidents. ""Standing up for human rights everywhere is in America's interests, and the Biden-Harris administration will stand against human rights abuses wherever they occur, regardless of whether the perpetrators are adversaries or partners,"" he said.",5

Each is deeply qualified and prepared to deliver justice faithfully under our Constitution and impartially to the American people — and together they represent the broad diversity of background, experience, and perspective that makes our nation strong,” Biden said in a statement. One notable choice is U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to take the place of Attorney General Merrick Garland on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/1st-news-media-allowed-inside-overcrowded-migrant-facility/story?id=76768789,politics,"The Biden administration for the first time on Tuesday allowed news media inside a Customs and Border Protection facility facing unprecedented overcrowding due to the recent surge of migrant children and families. A growing backlog inflamed by the coronavirus pandemic has caused delays for the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency responsible for housing children after they are apprehended by Border Patrol. Representatives from the press were allowed inside a temporary tent facility in Donna, Texas, which was meant to hold 250 migrants but had a population of more than 4,100 as of Tuesday. Of those, 3,400 were unaccompanied minors and more than 2,000 have waited beyond the legal limit of 72 hours, according to Customs and Border Protection. The video shows children and families packed into tight living quarters, sleeping on gray camping mats with mylar blankets for warmth. In transparent, plastic pods there is hardly room to walk with young children crammed shoulder to shoulder. Journalists also saw a fenced in recreation area where two groups of boys were playing soccer, agents in dark sunglasses watching over them. The facility spans 184,000 square feet and requires a staff of more than 500 agents. It takes $16 million per month to run the facility. ""As I have said repeatedly, a Border Patrol facility is no place for a child,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement Tuesday. ""We have been working around the clock, in coordination with HHS, to quickly move unaccompanied children out of these crowded Border Patrol stations and into the care of HHS so they can be placed with family members or other sponsors."" Earlier Tuesday morning, U.S. Border Patrol took a small group of journalists along dirt roads near the borderline, where they observed the arrest of migrants who had surrendered to authorities prior to their likely transfer to the Donna processing center. All unaccompanied children who are apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley are brought to the Donna facility where they receive a health screening and wait to be transferred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. CBP also takes temperatures as they arrive and refers them to additional health checks if they have a fever. Acting Executive Officer for Rio Grande Valley Operational Programs Division Oscar Escamilla showed reporters through the facility on Tuesday. ""Yes we are officers. Yes we enforce the   laws,"" Escamilla said. ""But when you have kids involved, we have to take care of these kids. This is not the right place for these kids."" Escamilla said children are offered the opportunity to call family members at least once every 48 hours while they are in the facility. The new administration took swift actions right from the start to reverse several immigration policies of the Trump era. While the new White House has come under fire for pulling back hard-line restrictions before it was fully prepared to handle the current surge of migrants, some remain in place. Biden administration officials are quick to point out one major departure from Trump’s pandemic-era immigration restrictions: the treatment of unaccompanied migrant children. When the Trump administration invoked a section of the public health code known as ""Title 42"" it gave immigration authorities the green light to start rapidly removing unaccompanied migrant children. Mostly in their teens, kids at the time were sent back to Mexico sometimes within a matter of hours. Customs and Border Protection said it was necessary to reduce overcrowding at its facilities. Legal advocates for immigrants have decried the use of Title 42 as illegal and unnecessarily cruel. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has taken on the responsibility of processing and caring for children who arrive at the border without a parent or guardian. The change, combined with an unprecedented increase in the number of kids found crossing the border, has strained government resources and sent the Biden administration scrambling to find more shelter space. Federal officials have enlisted convention centers in California and Texas, and even co-opted a NASA site for the mass housing effort. The difference in the application of the Title 42 so-called health mandates is also seen with migrant families who cross the border. Thousands have been turned back or ""expelled"" under the Biden administration, but the majority in recent weeks have remained in the U.S. for traditional immigration processing. Last February, nearly 20,000 migrant families were stopped at the border by U.S. immigration authorities. Of those, nearly 8,000 were rapidly ""expelled"" under Title 42. U.S. officials have said immigration officials on the other side of the border, in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, have refused to accept families with children under the age of 7.",5

But the   by the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as echoed by President Joe Biden, are reminders of the precarious nature of this moment regarding  . The Biden White House is now battling complacency in addition to politics, and   any sense that the pandemic is over. ""The war against COVID-19 is far from won,"" Biden said Monday, in encouraging governors to keep or reinstate mask mandates and announcing a strategic change in federal vaccination programs. ""As much as we're doing, America, it's time to do even more."" Polls have consistently   in Biden's leadership on COVID and vaccine distribution. But they have also shown partisan splits in willingness to follow   officials' recommendations, as Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell hinted at Monday in specifically encouraging ""Republican men"" to get vaccinated. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization is formally releasing its investigation into the origins of the pandemic. With former Trump administration officials making news with candid assessments about how the early months were handled, it might feel like a moment to look back instead of look forward. Five days ago, Biden stood for more than   and   about COVID. You can blame a relentless news cycle, or reporters for not asking about it, or even take that as a good sign about the country's mood at the moment. Biden would love to talk about other priorities, including the   he is set to outline Wednesday. But he needs to keep talking about the pandemic, as he and his aides are quite aware. Overnight, the seven-week-long voting period at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, came to a close. But in what has become   throughout pandemic-era elections, the results of this count won't be known for at least another week as more than 5,800   face the prospects of creating the first union at an   in the United States. The tabulation delay is likely to stem from challenges over factors like improper job classification or ineligibility due to employment dates. Both Amazon and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union -- the group from which Bessemer facility workers in favor of unionizing are   -- can raise these concerns before the vote tally is finalized. Beyond Alabama, the Bessemer warehouse election has already put labor law reform on the political map by giving common ground to the White House and party progressives. Biden   with a supportive video   last month, in which he reiterated his administration's policy of supporting union organization and collective bargaining. Meanwhile, high-profile progressives mobilized to highlight the impact of the pandemic on the working conditions of the predominantly Black workers at the Bessemer facility, which culminated in a Friday visit from Sen. Bernie Sanders, one of the most vocal political   of Amazon's attempts to block unionization. ""This campaign has already been a victory in many ways. Even though we don't know how the vote will turn out, we believe we have opened the door to more organizing around the country,"" Stuart Appelbaum, president of the RWDSU said in a statement. After a censure by the state GOP and a vow to unseat her, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, is facing her first potential   in Kelly Tshibaka. Alaska's all-party primary and ranked-choice general election means that Tshibaka won't face Murkowski directly in a primary, but her campaign launch made clear who she is running against, calling out Murkowski for her decision to vote with ""D.C. insiders."" Murkowski crossed party lines in February when she   former President Donald Trump with incitement of insurrection. Trump unleashed his ire on Murkowski the same way he did with   who   or convict him by   to those who   until the very end. Tshibaka makes no mention of Trump in her campaign launch, something unique as Trump allies have been jumping into high-profile congressional races across the country, but she did appear to side with him on the issue of election integrity by espousing a number of false theories about fraud in the November election. Trump hasn't weighed in on the   aside from a promise to unseat Murkowski, but it appears Tshibaka will have the backing of top Trump advisers:   reported Monday afternoon that former Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, along with a number of other Trump alums, will serve as advisers to her campaign. After early primary defeats in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, Joe Biden staked his bid for the presidency on the voters of South Carolina. They delivered for him; now, many are looking to him to return the favor.

https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rep-matt-gaetz-denies-sexual-relationship-underage-girl/story?id=76780776,politics,"Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., on Tuesday denied that he had an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl amid new reports that the Justice Department was investigating the alleged relationship -- claiming the probe was part of an elaborate extortion scheme. The investigation, first reported by The New York Times, began last summer and focuses on whether Gaetz had a sexual relationship with an underage girl and paid for her to travel with him, and whether he violated federal sex trafficking laws, a source aware of the investigation confirmed to ABC News. Gaetz told the Times that his lawyers were informed that he was the subject, not the target, of an investigation. ""I have not had a relationship with a 17-year-old. That is totally false,"" Gaetz told Fox News' Tucker Carlson in an interview Tuesday night. ""That is false and records will bear that out to be false."" The New York Times reported that the inquiry into Gaetz is part of a larger inquiry into Joel Greenberg, a former Florida official indicted last summer on charges that included sex trafficking of a child and financially supporting people in exchange for sex. Greenberg has pleaded not guilty. On Fox News, Gaetz -- who, according to an Axios report earlier on Tuesday, had been telling confidants he was considering retiring from Congress and possibly joining the right-wing media outlet Newsmax -- appeared to confirm the investigation when he said he was approached by someone who claimed he could ""make this investigation go away."" ""There was a demand for money in exchange for a commitment that he could make this investigation go away along with his co-conspirators,"" Gaetz said, identifying the alleged extortionist as former DOJ official David McGee. McGee did not respond to ABC News' request for comment. In an interview with the Washington Post, McGee denied Gaetz's claim that he was part of an extortion effort targeting the Florida congressman. ""It is completely false. It's a blatant attempt to distract from the fact that he's under investigation for sex trafficking of minors,"" McGee told the Post. ""I have no connection with that case at all, other than, one of a thousand people who have heard the rumors."" ""I do believe that there are people at the Department of Justice who are trying to smear me,"" Gaetz said on Fox News. In a statement from his office, Gaetz said he had been cooperating with authorities and that his father ""has even been wearing a wire"" at the FBI's direction ""to catch these criminals"" seeking to extort him for $25 million. Asked in the Fox News interview how long the investigation had been going on, Gaetz said ""I don't know,"" and went on to suggest that someone is alleging there are ""pictures of me with child prostitutes,"" which he claimed was ""obviously false."" At one point during the interview, Gaetz claimed that two years ago he had dinner with Carlson and took along  a ""friend"" who was ""actually threatened by the FBI, told that if she wouldn't cop to the fact that somehow I was involved in some pay-for-play scheme that she could face trouble."" But Carlson promptly denied knowing what Gaetz was talking about, responding: ""I don't remember the woman you're speaking of or the context at all, honestly."" After returning from a commercial break, Carlson called the segment ""one of the weirdest interviews I've ever conducted.""",0
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/civil-rights-group-sue-georgia-voting-law/story?id=76775186,politics,"Civil rights groups on Tuesday said they have sued the state of Georgia over   enacted last week that they said   for all Georgia  , particularly people of color.

The groups are suing in federal court on behalf of a church and other community groups. ""The elections were celebrated not just for their turnout, but also for their integrity, with Georgia officials praising them as safe and secure,"" the release said. ""But rather than act to expand participation in the political process, Georgia leaders responded by doing what they have done many times in the state's history: they placed burdensome, unjustified, and unnecessary restrictions on voters, particularly voters of color and other historically disenfranchised communities."" Sophia Lakin, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, pinned the motives of the law on race. ""This law is driven by blatant racism, represents politics at its very worst, and is clearly illegal,"" Lakin said in the statement. ""We urge the court to act swiftly to strike it down."" Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp defended the law from criticism last week, saying that critics -- including President Joe Biden -- hadn't read the law. ""This bill expands voting access, streamlines vote-counting procedures, and ensures election integrity,"" Kemp said in a tweeted statement. There is nothing 'Jim Crow' about requiring a photo or state-issued ID to vote by absentee ballot -- every Georgia voter must already do so when voting in-person."" Biden   an ""atrocity"" when speaking to reporters last week. In a statement Friday, he likened it to ""Jim Crow"" laws and called on Congress to pass a Democratic-supported federal measure to protect voting rights. ""This is Jim Crow in the 21st Century. It must end. We have a moral and Constitutional obligation to act. I once again urge Congress to pass the For the People Act and the   Voting Rights Advancement Act to make it easier for all eligible Americans access the ballot box and prevent attacks on the sacred right to vote,"" he said in the statement. Prominent Georgia voting rights activist and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams released a statement about the law shortly after it was passed last week. ""Every business, political, and civic leader must stand up and make their opposition to these desperate anti-democratic laws clear,"" Abrams said. ""At a time when Georgia ranks as the worst state for COVID vaccination rates, Georgia Republicans instead are singularly focused on reviving Georgia's dark past of racist voting laws.""",3
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/states-open-eligibility-1st-big-test-americas-vaccine/story?id=76768464,politics,"As the majority of adults in the country now sit on the cusp of eligibility for the    , the U.S. is shifting into the first real-world test of   of the inoculations. Up until the last few weeks,   only Americans with the highest   from the virus and the biggest incentive to protect themselves, were eligible. But by late April, as vaccine supply ramps up, all adults -- not just those with the most reason to fear the virus --   and get their shot. So, will they? ""This is when the real work begins,"" said Dr. Timothy Callaghan, a   politics professor at Texas A&M University who studies vaccine hesitancy. Callaghan said public health experts have been   particular fight for months, even before earlier vaccine issues were smoothed over. ""We weren't worried about the supply issues that we were seeing early in the vaccine delivery process,"" Callaghan said. ""We were concerned about what was going to start to happen from April through July, as states start to realize we have the vaccines, but don't have people to take them."" Now, on the heels of President Joe Biden's announcement that   to all adults by April 19, the time has come. The U.S. is administering nearly 3 million shots per day and, by May, drugmakers are expected to deliver enough vaccines to vaccinate 300 million Americans. Meanwhile, about six in 10 Americans reported already getting a vaccine or intending to get one -- a number that has increased -- with 17% who said they're taking a ""wait and see"" approach, according to March polling from the  . Remaining about the same since December are the 13% who said they will ""definitely not"" get the vaccine. With the floodgates open to mass vaccination, the spring and summer months should provide a clearer view of how much work needs to be done to vaccinate as many Americans as possible, Callaghan said. Among the first states to widen eligibility were Alaska, Mississippi, Texas, West Virginia, Ohio and Utah. As of Thursday, 19 states total had opened their eligibility to all adults 16 and older, and another 27 states plus Washington, D.C., had announced plans to do so. Some rural and Republican states have already seen signs of early hesitancy that allowed them, in part, to open their vaccination rollout up to the broader population earlier than any other states. Polling has shown people living in red, rural states report more vaccine hesitancy. In Ohio, the governor said they've seen less interest in vaccine registration as they open it up to younger populations. ""We seem to be having a slower uptake every time we move down in age,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said at a press briefing just before the state opened eligibility to all adults on March 29. ""But, I mean, the interesting thing is even in the older groups, you continue still to see those numbers go up,"" he said, noting that the number of vaccinated people in their 80s is continuing to rise. DeWine openly acknowledged that he was concerned about vaccine hesitancy getting in the way of herd immunity for the state, though. ""Frankly, a lot is gonna depend on our young people's willingness to take this vaccine and to slow the spread down,"" DeWine said. And in West Virginia, the state's   response coordinator, Clay Marsh, said they were surprised that as many people are getting vaccinated as they are. The state widely opened eligibility on March 22. ""We did anticipate having a lot more vaccine hesitancy,"" Marsh said, noting that people from rural and Republican areas of the country are more hesitant than those from urban and Democrat areas. ""Well, we're pretty rural and we're pretty Republican,"" Marsh continued. And while they've seen pockets of hesitancy, Marsh said, the state has been pleased that 70% of people in the 65+ age group have gotten vaccines. In December, state data showed that around 45% of the state was either less willing or strongly unwilling to get a vaccine. In Mississippi, one local doctor suggested people are waiting for the vaccine to appear at their physician's office before they get the shot. The state opened up eligibility to all adults two weeks ago and continues to have thousands of open appointments. ""It's not so much hesitancy as it is access for most of our patients,"" said Dr. Laura Miller, a family physician who mostly treats patients from rural, minority communities in Jefferson Davis County, Mississippi. Because   of all the vaccines in Mississippi have been offered at drive-thru mass vaccination clinics and other state-run sites, Miller sees a lot of patients who want to or need to wait until they can get the vaccine closer to home, in a more familiar setting. ""I have patients here that want to get their shot, they just don't have a means to get there or don't want to until I can do it,"" Miller said. There's also ""some hesitancy, and there's some straight refusal,"" she added. Still, Miller predicted that when there's enough vaccine supply to get doses out to individual clinics and pharmacies, ""we'll have some fairly steady uptake."" On Monday, Biden said that by April 19, 90% of Americans will live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Taken all together, even among states that share population demographics and politics, there's still not a sole factor that can predict vaccine hesitancy. Jeff Zients, Biden's coronavirus response coordinator, told reporters at a briefing last week that he wasn't concerned about states that were opening their eligibility up to all adults well in advance of the May 1 deadline. ""If there are states that are lagging behind, we're working with those states to ensure that they continue to prioritize the most vulnerable populations. That said, with the increase in demand, we think it's a good thing that states are opening up eligibility to all Americans no later than May 1st,"" Zients said Friday. But while there will be people who want the vaccine and people who don't, states will also have to do more than just open up eligibility to achieve herd immunity. They will have to improve systems making it harder for people to get the vaccine, compounding hesitancy that already exists. Long drives to unfamiliar towns or cities where vaccines are being distributed, clunky registration websites, long hold times on the phone and lack of outreach can all give the impression of ""vaccine hesitancy,"" when in reality, community members are willing to get the vaccine but face logistical hurdles, which are often worse in poorer communities. Experts have also warned that opening up eligibility widely could allow people with easier access to transportation and technology to leap over less advantaged people for appointments. ""That is a potential red flag and something to be aware of,"" Callaghan said. ""To try and work against that, states need to be paying attention to populations they are vaccinating on a daily and weekly basis to say 'okay, we're not getting enough people from this at-risk community or that at-risk community, so maybe we need to set aside some appointments for those groups to make sure that they are still getting vaccinated.'"" There will also be unpredictable benefits to widely opening up eligibility, like the power of peer pressure. As more people get the vaccine, they'll share how they got it and what it felt like with their friends and family, increasing trust in the shot. But for the next several weeks, the effect will be unknown. ""You can't really say that hesitancy is the cause until you've given people a chance to vaccinate and then they choose not to,"" Callaghan said.",5
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/army-awards-microsoft-22-billion-contract-futuristic-goggles/story?id=76798519,politics,"The Army has awarded   a contract that could be worth almost $22 billion for   that give soldiers a new way to see the battlefield. Known as IVAS, the acronym for the Integrated Visual Augmentation System, the goggles project 3D terrain maps over what soldiers see directly in front of them and allows troops to see in the dark, through smoke and even around corners. Based on Microsoft's HoloLens 2, the augmented reality goggles were ruggedized for the wear and tear of combat and have undergone prototype testing over the past two years. On Wednesday, the Army announced that it had awarded a 10-year production contract to Microsoft for the IVAS system potentially worth $21.88 billion. The contract has a five-year base period followed by another five-year option, said Courtney Bacon, an Army spokesperson. Microsoft said that the contract could provide more than 120,000 goggles to the Close Combat Force. ""We appreciate the partnership with the U.S. Army, and are thankful for their continued trust in transitioning IVAS from rapid prototyping to rapid fielding,"" wrote Microsoft's Alex Kipman in a   post. Kipman designed Holo Lens and has led the research and development of the goggle's conversion into IVAS for the Army. Last fall, Kipman told ABC News that the goggle system provides soldiers with a significant upgrade in situational awareness. The system gives soldiers more information than they have ever had on the battlefield. ""The IVAS aggregates multiple technologies into an architecture that allows the Soldier to Fight, Rehearse, and Train using a single platform,"" said an Army statement   the production contract. Attached to combat helmets, the clear goggles allow soldiers to know precisely where they are thanks to a heads-up display, or HUD, that provides them with an overhead compass and overlays maps of their location. Holograms and 3D terrain maps are projected onto the goggles to see what lies ahead and lets soldiers know precisely where their squad mates are on the battlefield. The goggles also incorporate significant improvements in night vision and thermal imagery technologies that give soldiers a full 180-degree field of view. An attachment mounted on a rifle barrel projects onto the HUD whatever could be seen through the rifle scope, regardless of what direction a soldier is looking. That capability gives troops an edge in dangerous urban warfare by letting them peer around corners. The high-tech goggles will be made available to all of the Army's combat infantry troops, bringing them resources that may have once been only available to elite units. Eric Oehlerich, a retired Navy SEAL and ABC News contributor, sees that as a step toward improving the combat effectiveness of all American troops on the battlefield. ""The more situational awareness you have about your forces, and the enemy position, the easier it is to dominate the fight,"" he added. ""Investments in equipment like the IVAS goggles will greatly increase the awareness each service member will have during the 'fog of war,' making them more lethal when called upon."" Mick Mulroy, a retired Marine and ABC News contributor, agreed with Oehlerich, but also stressed that basic military skills will need to be maintained. ""It is also important that we don't become over reliant on technology,"" said Mulroy. ""We need to train with it and without it, as our adversaries will no doubt try and counter our technological improvements."" The deal is the second major contract won by the tech giant in recent years. Last year, the Pentagon selected Microsoft over Amazon to take over its $10 billion JEDI cloud project. While the IVAS contract is twice as large as the JEDI project, it could end up being less if the Army decides not to pursue its five-year option.",0
https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/students-successfully-lobby-state-law-excusing-school-protest/story?id=76736167,politics,"Middle and high school students across Virginia will soon be excused from school to participate in a protest or civic event thanks to a bipartisan group of students from Virginia Young Democrats and Virginia Teenage Republicans who joined forces to successfully lobby for the new law, which started as a school board policy in Fairfax County. The policy, which goes into effect July 1, grants students an excused absence from school one day a year to ""engage in a civic or political event."" School districts in other states have passed similar policies, but Virginia is the first to pass one statewide. ""There's this misconception that it's only about protests, that it's only about walking out,"" said Virginia Young Democrats Teen Caucus Chair Matthew Savage, 17. ""But it's also about just getting a sense of what your government is and trying to make a difference -- meeting with legislators, attending protests -- it's much more."" Savage decided to lobby his representatives to take the 2019 Fairfax County initiative statewide after seeing another policy his school district piloted -- requiring free menstrual products in schools -- had passed the Virginia legislature. He strategized with other Young Democrats and began reaching out to lawmakers, including Democrats Del. Sam Rasoul and state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, who committed to introducing it. ""It's critically important for us not to just encourage the youth to vote, but to actually empower them and have them involved in the civic process and what better way than to have them help draft bills -- which is what happened here -- help them lobby and then help them actually pass these bills,"" Rasoul said. McClellan said she chose to sponsor the legislation to stoke the students' interests. ""There is no substitute for live action, and by participating in civic events, they come alive in a way they just can't in a book or in a lecture in the classroom, so it will spark a passion in them that hopefully will keep them engaged,"" McClellan said. Savage also reached out to his Republican counterparts who agreed to collaborate on the bill. ""I don't think that this bill is liberal or conservative, I think it just helps students, it helps teenagers across the commonwealth get more involved, and that's something we all need to be working towards,"" said Teenage Republican Federation of Virginia Chairman Brady Hillis, 17. Republican Del. Glenn Davis decided to co-sponsor the legislation after the GOP students reached out to him. ""In a time that is so partisan in our nation right now, to see teenage Republicans and teenage Democrats come together to work together on a bill … sometimes you have to look at the next generation to see really how the adults should be acting,"" Davis said. Not every Republican in the Virginia General Assembly was so moved. ""I'm all for educating and getting more people involved in civics but school and education is a lot more important,"" said Republican Del. Wendell Walker. Republican Del. John Avoli said he encourages student engagement in civics but believes local school boards should be making these decisions. Mia Tilman, now an 18-year-old freshman at the College William and Mary, used the Fairfax County policy when she was a high school senior to lobby for the Equal Rights Amendment in Washington. She said she is not sure she would have done so if her absence was unexcused because she was concerned about blemishing her record while she was applying to colleges. Student athletes and students involved in academic clubs are excused from school for sports games and academic conferences, but there was no equivalent for a student interested in politics and civic action, Tilman said. ""To me, protesting is my academics, it is what I want to do with the rest of my life, and it holds just as much value to me as someone going to an athletic tournament to pursue their career,"" Tilman said. High school junior Makenzie Hymes, 16, also used the Fairfax policy to lobby for the ERA. ""There's so much you can learn outside of the classroom,"" Hymes said of her visit to the U.S. Capitol. ""(In) that type of environment, the littlest thing is like a whole life lesson."" Savage used the Fairfax County policy in order skip class and testify on the bill virtually before the state's House Education Committee. Gov. Ralph Northam signed the bill into law on March 12. Savage said students from both parties in other states have begun reaching out to him, saying they are trying to work with their legislators to introduce a similar bill in their state. ""Virginia has taken a national leadership role and is a goldfish bowl for the rest of the country in terms of civic engagement now,"" Savage said.",5
